The Explorers of Sky code seems to reference only the mirror at 0x1FF8000, the closest one to main memory.\n\nIn Explorers of Sky, a fixed region of the ARM9 binary appears to be loaded in the ITCM at all times, and seems to contain functions related to the dungeon AI, among other things.

The game actually maintains 6 separate sequences that can be used for generation: a primary LCG and 5 secondary LCGs. The generator used depends on parameters set on the global PRNG state.\n\nAll dungeon LCGs have a modulus of 2^32 and a multiplier of 1566083941 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_MULTIPLIER). The primary LCG uses an increment of 1, while the secondary LCGs use an increment of 2531011 (see DUNGEON_PRNG_LCG_INCREMENT_SECONDARY). So, for example, the primary LCG uses the recurrence relation:\n  x = (1566083941*x_prev + 1) % 2^32\n\nSince the dungeon LCGs generate 32-bit integers rather than 16-bit, the primary LCG yields 16-bit values by taking the upper 16 bits of the computed 32-bit value.
