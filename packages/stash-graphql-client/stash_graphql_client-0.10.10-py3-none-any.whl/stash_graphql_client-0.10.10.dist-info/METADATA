Async Python client for [Stash](https://stashapp.cc) GraphQL API.

## Features

- **ORM-like interface for GraphQL**: Use `.save()`, `.delete()`, and relationship helpers instead of writing mutations manually.
- **Identity map with Pydantic v2 wrap validators**: Same entity ID = same Python object reference. Nested objects with IDs are automatically separated into the identity map. Caching integrated at model construction—no separate cache layer needed.
- **Smart partial updates**: UNSET pattern sends only changed fields in mutations. Update one field without affecting others.
- **Type-safe with Pydantic v2**: Full runtime validation, IDE autocomplete, and error detection at development time.
- **Django-style filtering**: Familiar `rating100__gte=80` syntax instead of building complex GraphQL filter objects.
- **Async-first architecture**: Built for `async`/`await` throughout with native support for concurrent operations.
- **Full Stash API coverage**: Complete CRUD operations for all entity types, job management, metadata operations, and real-time subscriptions.

### Quick Example

```python
from stash_graphql_client import StashContext
from stash_graphql_client.types import Scene, UNSET

async with StashContext(conn={"Host": "localhost", "Port": 9999}) as client:
    # Find and update a scene
    scene = await client.find_scene("scene-id")
    scene.rating100 = 95
    scene.details = UNSET  # Don't touch this field
    await scene.save(client)  # Only sends rating100

    # Django-style filtering
    from stash_graphql_client import StashEntityStore
    store = StashEntityStore(client)
    top_rated = await store.find(Scene, rating100__gte=90)
```
