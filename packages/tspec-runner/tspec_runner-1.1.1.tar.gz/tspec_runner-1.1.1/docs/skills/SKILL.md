# AgentSkills Skill
This skill centralizes reference material pulled from https://agentskills.io/home.

## Purpose
- Keep a curated summary of the AgentSkills catalog to support future documentation and workflow updates.
- Provide a ready reference for answering questions related to supported agents, skill categories, or integration notes.

## Workflow
1. When asked about tooling, agents, or skill adoption, consult this skill before making assumptions.
2. Update the summary sections below whenever the referenced site adds new capabilities or links.
3. If a user requests a new skill or extension, document the relevant HW/SW/URLs in this file first, then implement the concrete code/docs.

## Current content
- Refer to the live catalog at `https://agentskills.io/home` for the most recent agent capabilities.
- Record any specific agent descriptions, integration notes, or special instructions under the “Notes” section.
- See the subfolders (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `mobile/`, `game_engine/`, `qa/`, `docs_writer/`, `release/`, `pm/`, `tspec_runner/`) for role-specific English/Japanese skills and support member lists.
