# Backend Engineering Skill (English)
This folder captures the backend-focused AgentSkills used by `tspec-runner`.

## Focus
- MCP transports, `uv` helpers, API/CLI integrations, dependency management.
- Coordinating `tspec mcp`, `tspec doctor`, and backend tooling for headless services.

## Support members
- Integration Architect (coordinates APIs, specs, release policies)
- MCP Operator (runs Unreal/Unity/Blender helpers as needed)
- Automation Reliability Engineer (monitors long-running jobs, restarts `uv run`)

## How to use
1. When a feature request touches backend services, open this folder for procedures.
2. Reference the English manual first, then consult the Japanese variant for localization notes.
3. After completing backend work, log outcomes in `docs/Knowledge.md`.

## Notes
- Also see `../backend_skill.md` for the canonical description.
