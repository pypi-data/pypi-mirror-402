# AgentSkills - Frontend Engineering
Captures agent capabilities focused on frontend/UI automation (Selenium, Playwright, agent-browser) from https://agentskills.io/home.

## Purpose
- Describe which AgentSkills handle browser automation, UI flows, and screenshot/report pipelines.
- Help assign requests to a frontend-focused skill if they touch `ui.*`, `agent-browser`, Playwright, etc.
- Draw inspiration from `skills/webapp-testing` and `skills/frontend-design` folders in the Anthropic repo to handle Selenium/Playwright flows, frontend design guidance, and artifact generation (screenshots/GIFs).

## Workflow
1. Consult this file whenever a request mentions Selenium, Playwright, browsers, or CLI/UI automation flows.
2. Highlight the relevant skill name, supported backend (agent-browser, MCP UI), and any automation caveats pulled from the catalog.
3. Record QA checks (screenshot quality, timing) in the “QA hooks” section for reuse.

## QA hooks
- Use frontend skill entries to remind future agents to double-check UI flows and screenshot directories before finishing.

## Notes
- Last synced: TODO.
