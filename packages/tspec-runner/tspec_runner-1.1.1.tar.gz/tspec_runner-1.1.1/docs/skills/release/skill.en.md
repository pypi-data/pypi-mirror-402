# Release Skill (English)
Tracks versions, release notes, and PyPI publishing.

## Focus
- Version bumps, release notes, PyPI metadata, and `twine check`.
- Coordinating GitHub release steps and tagging.

## Support members
- Release Manager (coordinates versioning, changelog, GitHub release)
- Packaging Engineer (validates `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `dist/*`)
- QA Release Verifier (runs sanity checks before publish)

## How to use
1. Follow this folder when incrementing versions or updating release notes.
2. Use English doc for release flow and Japanese doc for internal communication.
3. Record publishing results in `docs/Knowledge.md`.

## Notes
- The consolidated summary lives in `../release_skill.md`.
