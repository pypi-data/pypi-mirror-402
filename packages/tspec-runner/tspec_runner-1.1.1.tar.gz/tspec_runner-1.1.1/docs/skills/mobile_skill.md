# AgentSkills - Mobile Automation
Focuses on Android/iOS automation skills (Appium, device/emulator setup) aligned with https://agentskills.io/home.

## Purpose
- Capture mobile automation practices for Android/iOS (Appium server, drivers, emulator/device management).
- Document the expected environment checks and troubleshooting for mobile UI tests.
- Keep mobile-specific install/update steps separate from web automation and MCP tooling.

## Workflow
1. When requests mention Android/iOS/Appium, open this file before editing manuals or testcases.
2. Track required SDK paths, emulator setup, and driver install status for each platform.
3. Add post-run notes about device stability or timeouts into Knowledge.md.

## Usage tips
- TL;DR: anything Appium/mobile? use this skill before touching `android_env`/`ios_env` manuals or mobile testcases.

## Notes
- Last synced: TODO.
