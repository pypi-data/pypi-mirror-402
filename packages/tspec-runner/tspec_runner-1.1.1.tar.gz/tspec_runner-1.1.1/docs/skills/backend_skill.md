# AgentSkills - Backend Engineering
Focuses on backend-centric capabilities (API, infrastructure, MCP server integrations) described on https://agentskills.io/home.

## Purpose
- Keep backend-related AgentSkills details (service connectors, MCP transport management, job queue orchestration) in one place.
- Clarify what backend skills are available for future work (e.g., uv-based servers, Python MCP tooling).
- Reference the `skills/mcp-builder` folder in the Anthropic skills repo: https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/mcp-builder
- Include documentation-focused skills (`docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`) that rely on backend processing pipelines such as file conversion and templated generation.

## Workflow
1. When a request needs backend expertise (API integration, MCP servers, dependency management), open this file first to reference relevant agent skills.
2. Document each backend skill with its name, description, and key links/notes drawn from the live catalog.
3. Update the “Usage tips” section after applying the skill to a task so future agents know which backend role to re-use.

## Usage tips
- TL;DR: need Python/MCP/uv experience? pick the backend skill entry before touching docs or code touching `mcp` or CLI servers.

## Notes
- Last synced: TODO.
