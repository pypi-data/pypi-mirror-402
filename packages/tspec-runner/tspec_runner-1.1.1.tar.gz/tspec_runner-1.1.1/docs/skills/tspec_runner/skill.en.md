# TSpec Runner Skill (English)
Focuses on CLI commands, runners, and spec-level behaviors.

## Focus
- `tspec run/validate/manual/report/doctor` flows, CLI flags, and backend selection.
- Ensuring english/japanese docs describe CLI behavior correctly.

## Support members
- CLI Specialist (flags, default language, report outputs)
- Spec Author (maintains `examples/*.tspec.md`, ensures `suite` definitions)
- Manual Steward (links CLI docs to manual content)

## How to use
1. When CLI behavior or spec definitions change, consult this folder.
2. Use English doc for feature behavior, Japanese doc for messaging.
3. Record CLI regressions or docs updates in `docs/Knowledge.md`.

## Notes
- See `../tspec_runner_skill.md` for the core summary.
