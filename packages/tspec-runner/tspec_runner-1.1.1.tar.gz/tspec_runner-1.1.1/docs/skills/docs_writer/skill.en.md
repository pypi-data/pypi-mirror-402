# Documentation Skill (English)
Maintains README, manuals, and asset instructions for the project.

## Focus
- README/TSPEC manuals, asset pipelines, PyPI long descriptions.
- Managing screenshot/video guidance, GitHub vs. PyPI display notes.

## Support members
- Docs Creator (writes/updates README and manuals)
- Asset Curator (handles demo images/GIFs under `docs/assets`)
- Localization Partner (ensures EN/JP parity)

## How to use
1. Start here when documentation updates are requested.
2. Reference the English doc for structure and JP version for translation cues.
3. After publishing docs, mention updates in `docs/Knowledge.md`.

## Notes
- See `../docs_writer_skill.md` for the consolidated overview.
