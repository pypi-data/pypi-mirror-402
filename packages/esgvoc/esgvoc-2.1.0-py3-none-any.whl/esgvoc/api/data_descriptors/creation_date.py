    Date (more specifically timestamp) that the file was created

    Examples: "2025-08-21T04:23:12Z", "2024-04-11T14:03:10Z"

    Note that the examples above assume a `regex` of
    `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}Z`
    (this matches ISO 8601 timestamps in UTC).
    If you use a different regex, different examples would be needed.
