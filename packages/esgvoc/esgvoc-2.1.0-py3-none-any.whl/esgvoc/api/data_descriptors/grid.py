    further resources can be found e.g. cell areas.

    # Developer note:
    # There is a tight coupling to region
    # (see https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP7-CVs/issues/202#issue-3084934841).
    # However, this region can't be the same as the regions used by EMD,
    # as EMD has the 'limited_area' region, but that's not something
    # which makes sense in the CMIP context (it's too vague).
    # As a result, we need to have both Grid (CMIP) and HorizontalGrid (EMD)
    # and both Region (CMIP) and HorizontalGridRegion (EMD).
