    These terms are intended to help with identifying required components for experiments
    or filtering models based on having common components.
    For example, an aerosol scheme or a circulation model or a biogeochemistry component.
    However, model component is only an approximate term, there is no precise definition
    of whether any given model has or does not have a given component.

    # For CMOR tables, the convention seems to just be to use the drs_name,
    # which is awkward because there is more than one possible AOGCM (for example).
    # Hence, I think we actually need two classes.
