    Specifies the intent for a (TLS) keylogger to be used in a client or server configuration.

    This type allows you to control how TLS session keys are logged for debugging or analysis.
    You can either use the default environment variable (SSLKEYLOGFILE) or specify a file path
    directly. This is useful for tools like Wireshark that can decrypt TLS traffic if provided

    Specifies which application protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1) may be negotiated
    over a single TLS connection.
    """

    Authentication relies on out-of-band pre-shared keys instead of certificates.
    """

    enable_ech_grease: NotRequired[bool]
    """
    Controls whether to send a GREASE Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) extension
    when no supported ECH configuration is available.

    GREASE prevents protocol ossification by sending unknown extensions.
    """

    permute_extensions: NotRequired[bool]
    """
    Controls whether ClientHello extensions should be permuted.
    """

    grease_enabled: NotRequired[bool]

    Allows TLS 1.3 endpoints to use temporary delegated credentials
    for authentication with reduced long-term key exposure.
    """

    curves_list: NotRequired[str]
    """
    List of supported elliptic curves.
    """

    cipher_list: NotRequired[str]
    """
    Cipher suite configuration string.

    """
    Overrides AES hardware acceleration.
    """

    random_aes_hw_override: NotRequired[bool]
    """
    Overrides the random AES hardware acceleration.
    """

    preserve_tls13_cipher_list: NotRequired[bool]
    """
    Sets whether to preserve the TLS 1.3 cipher list as configured by cipher_list.

    By default, BoringSSL does not preserve the TLS 1.3 cipher list. When this option is disabled
    (the default), BoringSSL uses its internal default TLS 1.3 cipher suites in its default order,
    regardless of what is set via cipher_list.

    When enabled, this option ensures that the TLS 1.3 cipher suites explicitly set via
    cipher_list are retained in their original order, without being reordered or
    modified by BoringSSL's internal logic. This is useful for maintaining specific cipher suite
    priorities for TLS 1.3. Note that if cipher_list does not include any TLS 1.3
    cipher suites, BoringSSL will still fall back to its default TLS 1.3 cipher suites and order.
