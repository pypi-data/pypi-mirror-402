Getting Started
---------------

If you're new to OpenFire, we recommend starting with the :doc:`thermal-radiation-examples` page, 
which demonstrates complete workflows using the BR 187 thermal radiation calculations.

Each example page includes:

- Complete code workflows
- Practical scenarios
- Typical parameter values
- Assessment criteria
- Multiple configuration comparisons
