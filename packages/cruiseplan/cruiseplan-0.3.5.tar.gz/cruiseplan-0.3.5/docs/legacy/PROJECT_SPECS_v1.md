## 🏗️ Core Architecture Specifications

### Decision Hierarchy (System Logic Flow)

When calculating the Cruise Timeline and Path, the system follows this strict hierarchy of constraints:

1. **Global Anchors (The "Bookends"):**
   - The cruise **MUST** start at `departure_port` and end at `arrival_port`
   - The first science action **MUST** be `first_waypoint` (formerly `first_station`) - uses entry point from operation abstraction
   - The last science action **MUST** be `last_waypoint` (formerly `last_station`) - uses exit point from operation abstraction
   - For time-based strategies, assume departure time of 08:00 local time, "daytime" is 08:00 - 20:00

2. **Leg Sequence (The "Chapters"):**
   - Legs are executed strictly in the order listed in the YAML
   - The system moves from the exit point of Leg N to the entry point of Leg N+1 using the operation abstraction interface

3. **Cluster Constraints (The "Paragraphs"):**
   - **Contiguity:** The ship enters a Cluster and completes ALL tasks inside before leaving (unless `--flatten-groups` is used)
   - **Internal Order:**
     - If `activities` is defined → Follow it exactly
     - If `strategy: sequential` → Finish List A, then List B
     - If `strategy: day_night_split` → Interleave based on time constraints
     - If `strategy: spatial_interleaved` → Solve TSP for shortest path

4. **Atomic Operations (The "Words"):**
   - **PointOps:** Zero spatial displacement, only temporal (duration)
   - **LineOps:** Has internal geometry. The optimizer creates a "Tunnel" constraint - you must travel Start to End without performing other tasks inside

### Spatial Operations Hierarchy

The system organizes all cruise activities using a Composite Pattern that distinguishes between atomic physical actions and logical grouping containers.

```
Cruise (Top-level container)
└── Legs (Discrete working areas/time periods)
    └── Operations (Spatial activities)
        ├── Point Operations (Atomic: Zero-displacement activities)
        │   ├── CTD Profiles (Ship status: Dynamic Positioning)
        │   ├── Mooring Ops (Ship status: Station Keeping)
        │   └── Waypoints (Ship status: Navigation only)
        │
        ├── Line Operations (Atomic: Continuous displacement activities)
        │   ├── Transfers (Transit from A to B at cruise speed)
        │   ├── Towyo/Trawls (Transit from A to B at working speed)
        │   └── Underway Geophysics (Continuous sampling along path)
        │
        ├── Composite Operations (Logical Containers)
        │   ├── Sections (Ordered list of Points along a geometric line)
        │   └── Observatories/Clusters (Spatially related mix of CTDs & Moorings)
        │
        └── Area Operations (Regional activities - defined by a polygon)
            ├── Grid Surveys (systematic area coverage)
            └── Area Activities (diffuse regional work)
```

### Spatial Base Classes

**PointOperation**
```python
# Activities occurring at fixed geographic coordinates
# Examples: CTD profiles, mooring deployments, calibrations
# Attributes: latitude, longitude, depth, duration, time_of_day (e.g. daytime for moorings)
# Duration calculation: depth-based (profiles) or user-defined (moorings)
```

**LineOperation**
```python
# Activities involving continuous vessel movement from Start to End
# Crucial distinction: The operation IS the movement
# Examples: Ship transfers, towyo operations, trawling
# Attributes: start_pos, end_pos, route, distance, speed_mode (transit vs working)
# Duration calculation: distance / speed
```

**Cluster**
```python
# Logical containers for grouping related PointOperations
# Examples: "53N Section" (20 CTDs), "OSNAP Array" (Mixed CTDs + Moorings)
# Attributes:
#   - activities: List[str] (references to activity names)
#   - strategy: Enum (SEQUENTIAL, INTERLEAVED, DAY_NIGHT_SPLIT)
#
# Function:
#   Calculates total duration not just by summing children, but by
#   solving the internal routing logic (e.g., optimizing Day-Ops vs Night-Ops)
```

**AreaOperation**
```python
# Activities within defined polygonal regions
# Examples: grid surveys, area monitoring, search patterns
# Attributes: boundary_polygon, area, sampling_density
# Duration calculation: area coverage models or user-defined
```

### Entry/Exit Point Abstraction Architecture

**Purpose**: Provide a unified, type-agnostic interface for routing calculations across all operation types.

**Problem Solved**: Previously, routing logic needed operation-specific code to determine entry and exit points for different operation types. This created maintenance burden and coupling between routing algorithms and operation implementations.

**Abstraction Methods**:

```python
# Unified interface implemented by all operation types
class Operation:
    def get_entry_point(self) -> Coordinate:
        """Return the geographic coordinate where this operation begins"""
        pass
    
    def get_exit_point(self) -> Coordinate:
        """Return the geographic coordinate where this operation ends"""
        pass
```

**Operation Type Abstractions**:

**Point Operations**:
```python
def get_entry_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.position  # Station coordinates
    
def get_exit_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.position  # Same point for entry and exit
```

**Line Operations**:
```python
def get_entry_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.route[0]  # First waypoint in route
    
def get_exit_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.route[-1]  # Last waypoint in route
```

**Area Operations**:
```python
def get_entry_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.calculate_center_point()  # Calculated center of polygon
    
def get_exit_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.calculate_center_point()  # Same center point for entry/exit
```

**Cluster Operations**:
```python
def get_entry_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.stations[0].get_entry_point()  # First operation entry
    
def get_exit_point(self) -> Coordinate:
    return self.stations[-1].get_exit_point()  # Last operation exit
```

**Routing Calculation Improvements**:

- **Type-Agnostic Distance Calculations**: Routing algorithms use `get_entry_point()` and `get_exit_point()` without knowing operation type
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: New operation types only need to implement the abstraction interface
- **Cleaner Code**: Eliminates operation-specific conditional logic in routing calculations
- **Consistent Behavior**: All operations provide predictable entry/exit coordinates for scheduling

**Benefits**:

- **Future-Proof**: Adding new operation types requires only implementing the abstraction interface
- **Type-Agnostic**: Routing algorithms work with any operation type without modification
- **Cleaner Code**: Eliminates complex conditional logic based on operation type
- **Maintainable**: Centralized interface reduces coupling between routing and operation implementations
- **Testable**: Abstraction interface can be easily mocked for unit testing

**Developer Note: The "Hybrid" Pattern**

The parsing engine must support a "Hybrid" list structure. A list of moorings in a cluster may contain **Strings** (references) AND **Dictionaries** (inline definitions).

- **If type is String:** Look up in Catalog
- **If type is Dict:** Validate schema and use as-is

This allows the user to catalog their major assets while quickly adding "one-off" tasks inline without cluttering the global catalog.

### Leg-Based Organization

**Purpose**: Enable complex multi-area expeditions while maintaining simple single-leg default

**Structure:** The legs list contains discrete working phases. Within a leg, users can define composite groups to manage complex localized activities alongside standard sections.

```yaml
# Single-leg cruise (default - transparent to user)
cruise_name: Simple_Cruise_2028

# Point Operations (featureType: point)
points: [...]          # CTD profiles, water sampling, calibrations, mooring deployments and recoveries (as points with operation_type: "mooring" and action: "deployment"/"recovery")

# Line Operations (featureType: trajectory) 
lines: [...]         # Scientific operations along paths (ADCP, towing, bathymetry)

# Area Operations (featureType: trajectory or specialized)
areas: [...]    # Systematic coverage patterns, grid surveys

# Pure navigation (automatically generated by scheduler)
# NavigationalTransit objects created automatically for vessel movement between operations

# Multi-leg cruise with enhanced operation types
cruise_name: Complex_Expedition_2028
legs:
  - name: "Irminger_Sea_Operations"
    description: "Deep water mooring recoveries"

    # Point Operations: Fixed location scientific activities
    activities:
      - "STN_001"
      - "STN_002"

  - name: "53N_Observatory_Work"
    description: "Mixed operations with Day/Night constraints"

    # Composite: A cluster of mixed activities
    clusters:
      - name: "53N_Array"
        strategy: day_night_split    # Tells the scheduler: Day? Pop from moorings, Night? Pop from stations

        # OPTION A: Explicit Mixed Sequence (Manual Control)
        activities:
          - "MOOR_K7"          # Reference to a Mooring
          - "STN_001"          # Reference to a Station  
          - "ADCP_Transect_A"  # Reference to a Survey
          - "Grid_Survey_Alpha" # Reference to an Area Survey

        # OPTION B: Unordered Activities (Optimization Target)
        ordered: false
        activities: [CTD_01, CTD_02, CTD_20, M_53_A, M_53_B, M_53_C, ADCP_Line_1, Bathymetry_Survey_2, Grid_Alpha, Systematic_Mapping_Beta]
```

### Controlled Vocabulary

**Mooring Actions:**
- `"deployment"` - Deploy mooring at location
- `"recovery"` - Recover existing mooring

**Survey Operation Types:**
- `"underway"` - Instruments operating while ship underway (nothing over the side)
- `"towing"` - Towed instruments or devices deployed behind vessel

**Survey Actions:**
- `"ADCP"` - Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler survey
- `"bathymetry"` - Multibeam or singlebeam seafloor mapping
- `"thermosalinograph"` - Underway temperature and salinity measurement
- `"tow_yo"` - Tow-yo CTD profiling operations
- `"seismic"` - Seismic reflection/refraction surveys
- `"microstructure"` - Microstructure turbulence profiling

**Area Survey Pattern Types:**
- `"grid_survey"` - Systematic grid-based coverage
- `"systematic_mapping"` - Structured mapping pattern
- `"search_pattern"` - Search and rescue or target location patterns
- `"random_sampling"` - Statistical sampling within defined area

**Benefits:**
- **Operational Logic**: Allows grouping of spatially related activities that are operationally distinct
- **Temporal Organization**: Sequential phases with different objectives
- **Resource Management**: Equipment and personnel allocation by leg or by Cluster
- **Risk Assessment**: Isolated evaluation of different cruise components

The activities field provides a unified list of all operations to be executed within the cluster. If ordered=True, activities will be executed in the exact order specified. If ordered=False, the optimizer will perform route optimization (TSP) on all activities.

### Optimization Logic & Strategy Matrix

The Route Optimizer uses a hierarchical approach. It respects the "Container" structure of Legs and Clusters unless explicitly overridden. Within a container, behavior is determined by the strategy and ordered attributes.

**Strategy Definitions:**

1. **sequential** (Default)
   - Behavior: Respects the exact order defined in the YAML
   - Split Lists: If moorings and stations are defined separately, executes all Moorings (in list order) followed by all Stations (in list order)
   - Use Case: Standard transects where geometry dictates the sequence

2. **day_night_split** (The "Zipper")
   - Behavior: Preserves the internal order of each individual list but interleaves them based on temporal constraints
   - Logic: The system maintains two parallel queues. It checks the clock and pops the next item from the queue that matches the current light conditions (Day=Moorings, Night=Stations)
   - Constraint: It never looks ahead. It must finish Mooring[0] before considering Mooring[1]

3. **spatial_interleaved** (The "Constrained TSP")
   - Behavior: Ignores list order. Merges all defined operations into a "Cloud of Tasks" and solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to minimize total distance
   - Constraint - Point Operations: Treated as standard nodes (Lat/Lon)
   - Constraint - Line Operations: Treated as "Macro-Nodes" with strict entry/exit ports
     - Atomic: The optimizer cannot insert a station inside a line
     - Directionality: If reversible: true, the solver tests both directions (Start→End vs End→Start). If false, strictly Start→End

**The "Unified Sequence" Precedence:**

When parsing a Cluster, the system looks for operations in this priority order:

1. **activities** List: This is the **Absolute Truth**. It defines a specific mixed order (e.g., M1 → S1 → S2 → M2). The ordered flag controls whether this sequence is strict (ordered: true) or can be optimized (ordered: false)

2. **Legacy Support**: Older configurations may still use separate moorings/stations lists, but these are deprecated in favor of the unified activities field

**Distance Calculation:**

1. **Transit Segments:**
   - **Mobilization:** `Distance(departure_port, first_waypoint.get_entry_point())`
   - **Demobilization:** `Distance(last_waypoint.get_exit_point(), arrival_port)`
   - **Inter-Operation:** Haversine distance between sequential operation exit/entry points using abstraction interface

2. **Composite Cluster Distance:**
   - If a Cluster contains multiple lists (e.g., `moorings` and `stations`), the calculator treats them as **Sequential Blocks** by default
   - Formula: `Path(List_A) + Transfer(List_A_End -> List_B_Start) + Path(List_B)`
   - Note: This provides the "Base Geometric Distance". Any extra distance incurred by day/night zig-zagging is captured in the `maneuver_factor` (optional global setting) rather than the raw track distance

## 📊 Data Model Specifications

### YAML Configuration Schema

The configuration is divided into two logical parts: the Catalog (definitions of assets/operations) and the Schedule (the organization of work into legs and clusters).

### Part 1: The Catalog (Global Definitions)

These lists define "What" exists. Order here does not imply execution order.

**Core Cruise Definition**
```yaml
# Global Cruise Parameters

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# GEOGRAPHIC ANCHORS (The "Bookends" of the Cruise)
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# 1. The Ports (Physical Start/End of the ship's journey)
departure_port:
  latitude: float         # Required. Decimal degrees (-90 to 90)
  longitude: float        # Required. Decimal degrees (-180 to 360)
  name: string            # e.g. "St. Johns"
  timezone: string        # e.g. "GMT-3.5"

arrival_port:
  latitude: float       # Required. Decimal degrees
  longitude: float      # Required. Decimal degrees
  name: string            # e.g. "Reykjavik"
  timezone: string        # e.g. "GMT+0"

# 2. The Scientific Boundaries (The first/last science acts)
# These define the "Transit to/from Working Area" segments
# The Optimizer will effectively "Lock" these stations in place
first_waypoint: "STN_01_Deep"  # Must match a name in the Catalog - routing uses entry point
last_waypoint: "Mooring_K7"    # Must match a name in the Catalog - routing uses exit point

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# RESOURCE CATALOG
# Definitions of all potential operations
# These do not appear in the schedule unless referenced
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Station Definitions
points:
  - name: string                      # Required: ID: e.g., STN01
    latitude: float                 # Required. Decimal degrees
    longitude: float                # Required. Decimal degrees
    depth: float                      # Optional: Water depth (validated against bathymetry)
    duration: float                   # Optional: Override calculated duration
    comment: string                   # Optional: Station description
    position_string: string           # Auto-generated: Degrees + decimal minutes format coordinates "lat string, lon string"

# Mooring definitions (DEPRECATED - now included in stations list)
# Moorings are now defined in the stations list with operation_type: "mooring"
# See stations section above for current schema
    action: "deploy|recover"          # Required: Operation type (service = deploy+recover)
    duration: float                   # Required: Operation duration (minutes)
    depth: float                      # Optional: Water depth
    comment: string                   # Optional: Mooring description
    equipment: string                 # Optional: Equipment description
    lat_str: string                   # Auto-generated: Degrees + decimal minutes format
    lon_str: string

# Transect definitions (Line Operations)
lines:
  - name: string                      # Required: Transect identifier
    comment: string                   # Optional: Transect description
    route:
        - latitude: 50.0
          longitude: -5.0
        - latitude: 60.0
          longitude: -6.0              # Required: List of waypoint coordinates ("lat, lon" in decimal degrees)
    vessel_speed: float               # Optional: Override default speed
```

**Developer Note:** Flexible Coordinate Parsing While the explicit latitude and longitude keys are preferred for readability and safety, the system must support a Flexible Location Model for all spatial objects (Ports, Stations, Moorings).

The parser must accept either:
    1. Explicit Keys: latitude: 47.5, longitude: -52.7
    2. Legacy String: position: "47.5, -52.7"
If both are present, the explicit keys take precedence. Values must be parsed as Signed Decimal Degrees (Positive North / Positive East).

### Part 2: The Schedule (Legs & Clusters)

These structures define "When/Where" operations happen by referencing the Catalog.

**Multi-Leg Structure**
```yaml
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# EXECUTION SCHEDULE
# ---------------------------------------------------------

legs:
  - name: string                      # e.g., "Irminger Sea"
    # Logic controls
    strategy: "sequential|spatial_interleaved|day_night_split"
    ordered: boolean                 # Default: True. If False, allows optimizer to shuffle

    # 1. EXPLICIT MIXED SEQUENCE (Highest priority)
    # Use this for precise manual control of mixed operation types
    sequence:
    - "Mooring_K7"                  # String reference from global catalog
    - "STN_001"                     # String reference from global catalog
    - "Transit_Line_A"

    # Hybrid Support: You can mix references and inline definitions
    # (Useful for one-off operations not worth cataloging)
    activities:
      - "STN_Deep_01"             # Reference by ID (includes stations, moorings, lines, areas)
      - name: "Unexpected_Calibration"  # Inline definition
        duration: 60

      # Naming logic for Internal IDs
      # Used to generate unique IDs for the system to reference
      # The pattern must contain a placeholder for the index
      # Example: "S1_Stn{:02d}" -> S1_Stn01, S1_Stn02...
      id_pattern: string      # Required
      start_index: int        # Optional (default 1)

    # Standard Sections (Simple Lines)
    sections:
      - name: "Standard_Line_A"
        start:
            latitude: float             # Required. Decimal degrees
            longitude: float            # Required. Decimal degrees
        end:
            latitude: float             # Required. Decimal degrees
            longitude: float            # Required. Decimal degrees
        distance_between_stations: 20
        reversible: boolean     # true
```

**Inheritance Logic:**

1. Check Leg: Does the specific leg object have the attribute (e.g., vessel_speed) defined?
2. Use Leg Value: If yes, use the leg-specific value for all calculations within that leg
3. Fallback: If no, traverse up to the Cruise parent object and use the global default
4. Error: If neither exists, raise ConfigurationError

### Validation Rules

**Required Validations:**
- YAML syntax and structure validation
- Coordinate range validation (-90 ≤ lat ≤ 90, -180 ≤ lon ≤ 180 OR 0 ≤ lon ≤ 360)
- Positive value validation (speeds, durations, distances)
- Unique name enforcement within categories
- Bathymetry depth comparison (optional warning system)
- Route continuity validation for multi-waypoint transfers

**Schema Evolution:**
- Backward compatibility for existing YAML files
- Graceful handling of missing optional fields
- Clear error messages with line number references
- Warning system for potential issues (depth mismatches, unusual values)

**Reference Integrity Validation:**

- **Resolution Pass:** When parsing legs, every string found in a moorings or stations list is treated as a Reference ID
- **Lookup Logic:** The system attempts to find a matching name in the global moorings or stations catalog
- **Error Handling:**
  - If ID is found: The full object is copied from the catalog into the Leg structure
  - If ID is NOT found: Raise ReferenceError: Mooring 'K7_Rec' is scheduled in Leg 1 but not defined in the Catalog
- **Type Checking:** Ensure a Mooring ID is not accidentally placed in a Station list, but mixed types are allowed in a Sequence list.

**Calculation Priority Rules:**

1. **Depth Resolution Hierarchy:**
   - Priority 1 (Manual): If a depth attribute is explicitly defined in the Catalog or Inline (even if calculate_depth_via_bathymetry is True), the system MUST use the manual value
   - Priority 2 (Bathymetry): If depth is missing/null AND calculate_depth_via_bathymetry is True, use the interpolated grid value from data/bathymetry.py
   - Priority 3 (Fallback): If neither exists, emit a Warning and default to 99999.


2. **Duration Logic:**
   - Point Operations (profile): turnaround_time + (depth * 2 / winch_speed)
   - Transfers: distance / vessel_speed (Use Haversine distance)
   - Day/Night Scheduling: Calculated relative to the global start_date

**Composite Operations Logic:**

Interaction of `ordered` and `strategy`

When a Cluster contains multiple operation lists (e.g., `moorings` and `stations`) and logic flags:

| Config | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| ordered: false (Default) | Full Optimization. The Optimizer merges all points into a single cloud and solves the TSP (Traveling Salesman) to minimize distance, respecting Day/Night windows if strategy is set. |
| ordered: true + strategy: sequential | Strict Append. Executes the moorings list in order, then the stations list in order. (Order is determined by the YAML field definition order). |
| ordered: true + strategy: day_night_split | The Zipper Pattern. The internal order of each individual list is preserved (Sequence A must be 1->2->3), but the scheduler switches between List A and List B based on the time of day. |

**Developer Note:**

In "Zipper" mode, the scheduler looks at head(moorings) and head(stations). If current_time is Day, it executes head(moorings). If Night, it executes head(stations). It does NOT look ahead to moorings[1] until moorings[0] is complete.

If arrival at the target happens during a prohibited window (e.g., Night for Moorings), add wait_time to the duration until the next valid window opens.

│ [Save Campaigns]│  ○ Keyboard navigation          │ [Load PANGAEA]  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Model:**
- **Mouse Controls**: Click to place stations, scroll to zoom, drag to pan
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - `'p'` or `'w'`: Switch to add WayPoint (single lat/lon) mode
  - `'l'` or `'s'`: Switch to add LineSection (defined by a start and end point) mode
  - `'a'`: Switch to add area (defined by a set of points and finished by clicking `'a'` again)
  - `'n'`: Toggle navigation mode
  - `'y'`: Save current stations to YAML
  - `'s'`: Save selected campaigns to pkl
  - `'c'`: Clear all placed operations (points, lines and areas)
  - `'r'`: Remove last placed operation (last point, or last line, or last area)
  - `'esc'`: Close window without saving
- **Visual Feedback**: Mode indicators, coordinate display, depth lookup
- **Real-time Updates**: Station counter (points), Transect counter (lines), Area counter (areas), coordinate formatting, validation status

**Bathymetry Integration:**
```python
# Depth contour specifications (oceanographic standard)
DEPTH_CONTOURS = [0, -50, -100, -200, -500, -1000, -2000, -3000, -4000]

# Interpolation Logic
def get_depth_at_point(lat, lon, grid):
    """
    Calculates depth using Bilinear Interpolation.
    1. Identify the 4 grid points surrounding the coordinate.
    2. Perform weighted average based on distance to grid points.
    3. Return interpolated float value.
    """

# Land Avoidance Logic
allow_land_stations: boolean = False  # Configurable setting

def validate_placement(lat, lon):
    depth = get_depth_at_point(lat, lon)
    if depth > 0: # Positive value indicates land (dataset dependent)
        if not allow_land_stations:
            raise InteractionError("Cannot place station on land")
        else:
            emit_warning(f"Station placed on land (Elevation: {depth}m)")
```

If the local ETOPO file is not found, get_depth_at_point should return a depth of -9999 to allow development to proceed without the 1GB dataset.

**Performance Requirements:**
- Sub-second response for station placement
- Smooth zooming and panning for regions up to 1000km×1000km
- On zoom, reset the aspect ratio to PROJECTION including all points within the zoom
- Efficient rendering for up to 10,000 PANGAEA data points
- Memory management for long interactive sessions

### PANGAEA Integration System

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
```python
# DOI List Processing
input: list_of_pangaea_dois.txt
│
├── DOI Validation (format: 10.xxxx/xxxxx)
├── PANGAEA API Queries (with rate limiting)
├── Event Extraction (lat/lon coordinates)
├── Campaign Grouping (by cruise/expedition)
├── Pickle Serialization (efficient storage)
└── Interactive Loading (checkbox interface)

output: selected_campaigns.pkl
```

**Performance & Visualization:**
- **Checkbox Interface**: Toggle visibility of individual campaigns
- **Bulk Operations**: Select all, clear all, save selection
- **Visual Distinction**: Different colors/markers per campaign
- **Performance Caching**: Pre-processed pickle files for large datasets
- **Metadata Display**: Campaign names, data counts, coordinate ranges
- **Smart Downsampling:**
  - Implementation of "Level of Detail" (LOD) rendering
  - When Map Zoom < X: Render every Nth point (stride slicing) to maintain >30fps
  - When Map Zoom > X: Render full resolution dataset
  - Thresholds configurable in config.py

**Visual distinction:** To generate this, pick 4 colors for fill colors which are colorblind distinguishable, then pick 5 edge colors also distinguishable, and 6 shapes. Then for the markers, cycle through each of these separately. So the first marker is (fill color 1, edge color 1, symbol 1), the second marker is (fill color 2, edge color 2, symbol 2). In this way, we are changing everything for each incremented marker.

**Data Format:**
```python
# Standardized campaign data structure
campaign_data = [
    (lat_array, lon_array, "Campaign_Name_1"),
    (lat_array, lon_array, "Campaign_Name_2"),
    # ... additional campaigns
]
```

**HTML Summary Report**

**File Structure:** The system generates a self-contained index.html report containing:

1. File Links: Direct download links for generated KML, CSV, JSON, and Plot files.
2. Cruise Schedule Summary: A high-level accounting of time budgets.
3. Detailed Breakdowns: Per-section, per-mooring, and per-transfer tables.

**Table 1: Cruise Schedule Logic**

The primary summary table must aggregate data from both global lists and nested Cluster/Leg lists.
- Format: HTML Table with borders.
- Columns: Task Category | Detailed Breakdown & Logic | Total Hours | Total Days

Content Specification:

Task Category	Description / Breakdown Column Logic	Hours / Days

1. Total Moorings

  Must Display:
    • Count of Global Moorings
    • Count of Cluster-nested Moorings
    • Total Count
    • Average duration per mooring

  Logic: `Sum(Global) + Sum(Legs.Clusters.Moorings)`

  Hours/Days are Calculated

2. Total Stations

  Must Display:
    • Total Count
    • Average Depth (m)
    • Average Duration (hrs)

  Logic: `Sum(Legs.Clusters.Stations) + Sum(Legs.Sections.Stations)`

  Hours/Days are Calculated


3. Miscellaneous

  Must Display (Bullet List):
    • Item Name: Duration
    • Item Name: Duration

  Example:

  <ul> <li>Glider Deploy: 2h</li> <li>Calibration: 4h</li> </ul>"

  Hours/Days are Calculated


4. Station Transits

  Must Display:
  • Total Distance (nm)
  • Pair Count (N-1)
  • Average Speed used (kts)

  Note: This represents small movements between stations, distinct from major transfers.

  Hours/Days are Calculated


5. Named Transfers

  Must Display (List):
    • Name of Transfer 1 (Distance nm)
    • Name of Transfer 2 (Distance nm)


  Logic: List all explicit Transfer objects defined in Catalog or Legs."

  Hours/Days are Calculated

6. TOTAL CRUISE

  Must Display:
    • Grand Total Operations Count
    • Checksum of all activities"

  Hours/Days are Sum(All)

**Table 2: Section/Cluster Details**

A detailed breakdown of every Transect, Section, or Cluster defined in the YAML.

- Columns:
    - Name: Section identifier.
    - Route: Start/End Coordinates (DD MM.mmm format).
    - Distance: Nautical Miles and Kilometers.
    - Stations: Count of stations within this section.
    - Spacing: Planned (YAML) vs Actual (Geodesic average).
    - Moorings: List of mooring names contained within this section (if any).

**Table 3: Asset Manifests**

Three separate tables providing the raw data for:

1. Moorings: Name, Position, Depth, Duration, Action (Deploy/Recover).
2. Transfers: Name, Start/End, Distance, Speed, Duration.
3. Misc Actions: Name, Duration.

**Data Aggregation Rules (Developer Note):** The HTML generator must perform a Deep Flattening operation before rendering.

1. Moorings: Global_Moorings + Flatten(Legs -> Clusters -> Moorings) + Flatten(Legs -> Sections -> Moorings)
2. Stations: Global_Stations + Flatten(Legs -> Clusters -> Stations) + Flatten(Legs -> Sections -> Stations)
3. Transits: Identify "Gaps" between spatial operations that are not covered by explicit "Named Transfers" and calculate them as "Station Transits."

```

### Subcommand Specifications

**cruiseplan schedule**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive cruise schedule from YAML configuration
cruiseplan schedule -c INPUT_CONFIG [-o OUTPUT_DIR]

Arguments:
  INPUT_CONFIG         YAML cruise configuration file
  OUTPUT_DIR           Path to save the schedules

Options:
  -c, --config-file    Path to cruise configuration (required)
  -o, --output-dir     Output directory (default: current)

Examples:
  cruiseplan schedule -c cruise2028.yaml -o results/
  cruiseplan schedule -c cruise.yaml --format latex,html
  cruiseplan schedule -c cruise.yaml --validate-depths --leg "Leg1"
```

**cruiseplan optimize**

**Optimization Behavior:** The command parses the YAML logic settings (strategy, ordered) and applies them. CLI flags act as **Global Overrides**.

```bash
# Optimize cruise routing from existing YAML configuration
cruiseplan optimize -c INPUT_CONFIG -o OUTPUT_DIR [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  INPUT_CONFIG          Existing YAML cruise configuration
  OUTPUT_DIR            Path to save the optimized YAML file

Options:
  -c, --config-file     Filename including path to cruise configuration (required)
  -o, --output-dir      Output directory (default: current)
  --algorithm           'nearest_neighbor' (fast) or 'genetic' (thorough). Default: nearest_neighbor
  --flatten-legs        Dissolve boundaries ignoring both Leg AND Cluster grouping.
                        Solves a global TSP for all operations.
                        (Default: False - Legs/Clusters remain contiguous)
  --flatten-clusters    Dissolve boundaries. Ignores Cluster grouping.
                        Solves a global TSP for every leg.
                        Allows stations to be mixed globally.
                        (Default: False - Clusters remain contiguous)
  --reorder-internal    Force shuffle. Ignores ordered: True in the YAML. Forces a
                        spatial_interleaved strategy on all clusters. Useful for "What if" analysis.
                        (Default: False - Internal YAML list order is preserved)
  --allow_reversal      Flip Lines. Allows the optimizer to reverse the direction
                        of line operations even if reversible: true is not set in the catalog
                        (Default: True - allows reversal of direction of line operations, but
                        if reversible: false on an operation then that holds)

Behavior Matrix:

| Flag Config | Resulting Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Default** | **Container Sort Only:** Reorders the sequence of whole Sections/Clusters to minimize transit, but the internal station order of each remains exactly as listed in YAML. |
| `--reorder-internal` | **Hierarchical Sort:** Reorders the Sections/Clusters, AND reorders the stations inside them (e.g., turns a zig-zag mooring list into a circle), but never mixes stations from Section A with Section B. |
| `--flatten-legs` | **Global TSP:** Ignores all structure. Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem for every single station on the list simultaneously. |
| `--flatten-clusters` | **Global TSP within legs** Ignores all structure. Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem for every single station in each leg  simultaneously. |

Behavior:
  1. Graph Building: Parses the input YAML to build a graph of nodes (stations) and edges (transfers).
  2. Algorithm: Applies the selected algorithm (TSP or Nearest Neighbor) to minimize total transit distance.
  3. Reference Preservation: The optimizer generates a new YAML file that only reorders the reference lists within the legs (Schedule). It does not inline or modify the Global Catalog definitions.
    - Input: stations: ["Stn_B", "Stn_A"]
    - Output: stations: ["Stn_A", "Stn_B"]
```

## 🛠️ Development Standards & Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

**Documentation Requirements:**
```python
# NumPy-style docstrings for all public functions
def calculate_ctd_duration(depth: float, descent_rate: float = 1.0,
                          ascent_rate: float = 1.0) -> float:
    """
    Calculate CTD profile duration based on water depth and instrument rates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth : float
        Water depth in meters (positive value)
    descent_rate : float, optional
        CTD descent rate in m/s (default: 1.0)
    ascent_rate : float, optional
        CTD ascent rate in m/s (default: 1.0)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Total profile duration in minutes, including descent and ascent

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If depth is negative or rates are non-positive

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calculate_ctd_duration(2000.0)
    66.7  # 2000m depth with default 1 m/s rates

    >>> calculate_ctd_duration(500.0, descent_rate=0.8, ascent_rate=1.2)
    20.8  # Custom instrument rates

    Notes
    -----
    Calculation assumes constant descent/ascent rates. Real-world operations
    may require additional time for instrument stabilization and data quality
    checks at depth.
    """
```

**Type Annotations:**
```python
# Full type annotations for all public APIs
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union
from pathlib import Path

class StationPicker:
    def __init__(
        self,
        work_lon: Optional[List[float]] = None,
        work_lat: Optional[List[float]] = None,
        pangaea_file: Optional[Union[str, Path]] = None
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize station picker with optional parameters."""

    def place_station(
        self,
        latitude: float,
        longitude: float
    ) -> Tuple[str, Dict[str, Union[float, str]]]:
        """Place station at coordinates and return station data."""
```

**Linting Configuration:**
```toml
# pyproject.toml - Ruff configuration
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py39"
line-length = 88

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",     # pycodestyle errors
    "W",     # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",     # pyflakes
    "I",     # isort
    "B",     # flake8-bugbear
    "C4",    # flake8-comprehensions
    "UP",    # pyupgrade
    "ANN",   # type annotations
    "D",     # pydocstyle
]

ignore = [
    "D107",  # Missing docstring in __init__
    "D203",  # 1 blank line required before class docstring
    "D213",  # Multi-line docstring summary on second line
]

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "numpy"  # Enforce NumPy-style docstrings
```

### Architecture Guidelines

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **Data Layer**: Pure data processing without UI dependencies
- **Business Logic**: Core calculations and validations
- **Presentation Layer**: Output generation and user interfaces
- **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface and argument handling

**Dependency Management:**
```python
# Core dependencies (required)
numpy >= 1.21.0          # Numerical computations
pandas >= 1.3.0          # Data manipulation
xarray >= 0.19.0         # N-dimensional data handling
netCDF4 >= 1.5.8         # Scientific data I/O
pyyaml >= 6.0            # Configuration file parsing

# Scientific dependencies
gsw >= 3.4.0             # Seawater calculations
scipy >= 1.7.0           # Scientific algorithms

# Visualization dependencies
matplotlib >= 3.4.0      # Interactive plotting
cartopy >= 0.20.0        # Geographic projections

# Data source dependencies
pangaeapy >= 1.4.0       # PANGAEA database access
requests >= 2.25.0       # HTTP client for data APIs

# Output generation
jinja2 >= 3.0.0          # Template rendering
simplekml >= 1.3.0       # KML file generation
```

**Error Handling Philosophy:**
```python
# Explicit error handling with user-friendly messages
class CruiseConfigurationError(Exception):
    """Raised when cruise configuration is invalid."""
    pass

class BathymetryDataError(Exception):
    """Raised when bathymetry data cannot be loaded or processed."""
    pass

def validate_cruise_config(config_path: Path) -> None:
    """Validate cruise configuration with detailed error reporting."""
    try:
        # Validation logic
        pass
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise CruiseConfigurationError(
            f"Invalid YAML syntax in {config_path}:\n{e}\n\n"
            f"Common fixes:\n"
            f"- Check indentation (use spaces, not tabs)\n"
            f"- Verify quotation mark matching\n"
            f"- Ensure list items start with '-'"
        ) from e
```

### Performance Guidelines

**Memory Management:**
- Lazy loading of large datasets (bathymetry data)
- Efficient caching strategies for repeated operations
- Memory profiling for interactive components
- Graceful handling of system memory limitations

**Optimization Priorities:**
1. **User experience responsiveness** (interactive components)
2. **Data processing efficiency** (large bathymetry datasets)
3. **File I/O optimization** (YAML parsing, output generation)
4. **Network efficiency** (PANGAEA API requests)

**Caching Strategy:**
```python
# Intelligent caching for expensive operations
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def load_bathymetry_region(lat_min: float, lat_max: float,
                          lon_min: float, lon_max: float) -> xr.Dataset:
    """Load and cache bathymetry data for specified region."""

# Persistent caching for user data
def cache_pangaea_campaigns(campaigns: List[Tuple],
                           cache_path: Path) -> None:
    """Cache processed PANGAEA campaigns to disk."""
    with open(cache_path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(campaigns, f, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
```
