Route optimization and spatial planning algorithms.

This module provides algorithms for optimizing cruise routes and spatial planning.
Currently implements placeholder functions for composite route optimization that
will eventually solve constrained Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP).

    Calculate total duration for operations within a Cluster.

    This function should eventually solve a Constrained Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    to optimize the order and routing of operations. For now, it returns the simple
    sum of the children's durations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    children : list of BaseOperation
        List of child operations to optimize.
    rules : Any
        Operational rules and constraints for optimization.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Total duration in minutes for all operations.

    Notes
    -----
    Phase 1 implementation: Simple sum of durations, ignoring routing complexity.
    Actual TSP/routing logic will be added in a later phase.
