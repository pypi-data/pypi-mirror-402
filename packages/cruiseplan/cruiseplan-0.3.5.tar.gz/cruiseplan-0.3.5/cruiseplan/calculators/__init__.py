"""
cruiseplan.calculators package.

This package contains calculation modules for cruise planning computations:

- :mod:`distance`: Geographic distance calculations using Haversine formula
- :mod:`duration`: Time duration calculations for cruise operations and activities
- :mod:`routing`: Route optimization and spatial planning algorithms
- :mod:`scheduler`: Core scheduling logic for generating cruise timelines

These calculators provide the mathematical and algorithmic foundation for determining
distances, durations, optimal routes, and scheduling sequences in oceanographic cruises.
