## Background & Context

**The Challenge:** Oceanographic cruise planning involves complex route and timing calculations, frequent unit conversions (nautical miles <-> kilometers, decimal degrees <-> degrees decimal minutes), and rapid plan updates.  Different people may need different formats--spreadsheets for quick calculations, degrees/decimal minutes for navigation, kilometers for station spacing, knots for voyage timing.  Using historical station locations may be preferred, but can be tricky to access.

- **Fragmented Tools**: Scattered spreadsheets, manual calculations, custom code snippets
- **Time-Intensive Processes**: Semi-manual station planning, timing calculations, and proposal formatting  
- **Error-Prone Workflows**: Manual depth lookups, coordinate formatting, and schedule validation

**The Solution:** CruisePlan provides an integrated, semi-automated system for an efficient cruise-planning workflow.


## Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
- **🔬 Oceanographic Researchers**: Principal investigators designing research expeditions
- **📊 Students**: Graduate students learning cruise planning methodology
- **📋 Proposal Writers**: Scientists preparing funding proposals with detailed cruise plans

**Research Domains:**
The primary development of CruisePlan is for physical oceanographers, with CTD stations, mooring deployments and glider operations as default.  However, it is possible to incorporate any type of point, line or area operation of a ship with a specified manual duration based on your own experience.

CruisePlan transforms complex cruise planning from a weeks-long manual process into a structured, validated workflow that produces proposal-ready documentation with some checks on operational feasibility.



**⚠️ Breaking Changes in v0.3.0:** Commands `cruiseplan download` and `cruiseplan pandoi` have been removed. Parameter names shortened (`--bathymetry-*` → `--bathy-*`). See [MIGRATION_v0.3.0.md](MIGRATION_v0.3.0.md) for migration guide and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete changes.

**⚠️ Breaking Changes in v0.3.3:** YAML configuration now uses `transects:` instead of `transits:` for scientific line operations and `waypoints:` instead of `stations:` for point operations.

**Disclaimer:** This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Users are responsible for validating all calculations, timing estimates, and operational feasibility for their specific cruise requirements. Always consult with marine operations staff and verify all outputs before finalizing cruise plans.
