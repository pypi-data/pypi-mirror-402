# Welcome to Payloop!

### Cost Visibility for AI Agents

Payloop is a lightweight infrastructure layer that gives AI teams real-time visibility into the true costs of deploying agents - across tasks, workflows, and customers. Most teams today can’t see what it actually costs to deploy their agents, making it nearly impossible to manage gross margins or price with confidence.

With just a single line of code, Payloop delivers:
- Cost tracking across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more in one place
- Breakdowns by task, agent, and customer in real time
- Confidence to deploy the right pricing model (cost-plus, token-based, outcome-based, etc.) while preserving gross margins

By surfacing exactly what’s driving cost and value, Payloop becomes the source of truth for agent economics - helping founders and operators scale their agents with confidence.
