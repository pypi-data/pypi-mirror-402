"""Minimal Python runner for covers - handles script execution with instrumentation.

This module is called from the Rust CLI and handles the parts that must be in Python:
- Import hooks for code instrumentation
- AST transformation for branch coverage
- Script/module execution in the correct Python context
- Fork/exit handling for multiprocess coverage
