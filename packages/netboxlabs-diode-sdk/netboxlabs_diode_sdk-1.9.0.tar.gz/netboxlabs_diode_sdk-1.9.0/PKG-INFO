              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Diode SDK Python

Diode SDK Python is a Python library for interacting with the Diode ingestion service utilizing gRPC.

Diode is a new [NetBox](https://netboxlabs.com/oss/netbox/) ingestion service that greatly simplifies and enhances the
process to add and update network data
in NetBox, ensuring your network source of truth is always accurate and can be trusted to power your network automation
pipelines. 

More information about Diode can be found
at [https://netboxlabs.com/blog/introducing-diode-streamlining-data-ingestion-in-netbox/](https://netboxlabs.com/blog/introducing-diode-streamlining-data-ingestion-in-netbox/).

  * Secure connections: `grpcs://example.com` or `https://example.com`

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeClient
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import (
    Device,
    Entity,
)


def main():
    with DiodeClient(
        target="grpc://localhost:8080/diode",
        app_name="my-test-app",
        app_version="0.0.1",
    ) as client:
        entities = []

        """
        Ingest device with device type, platform, manufacturer, site, role, and tags.
        """

        device = Device(
            name="Device A",
            device_type="Device Type A",
            platform="Platform A",
            manufacturer="Manufacturer A",
            site="Site ABC",
            role="Role ABC",
            serial="123456",
            asset_tag="123456",
            status="active",
            tags=["tag 1", "tag 2"],
        )

        entities.append(Entity(device=device))

        response = client.ingest(entities=entities)
        if response.errors:
            print(f"Errors: {response.errors}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### Using Metadata

Entities support attaching custom metadata as key-value pairs. Metadata can be used to store additional context, tracking information, or custom attributes that don't fit into the standard NetBox fields.

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeClient, Entity
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import Device, Site, IPAddress

with DiodeClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:8080/diode",
    app_name="my-app",
    app_version="1.0.0",
) as client:
    # Create a device with metadata
    # Note: Both the device and its nested site can have its own metadata
    device = Device(
        name="Device A",
        device_type="Device Type A",
        site=Site(
            name="Site ABC",
            metadata={
                "site_region": "us-west",
                "site_cost_center": "CC-001",
            },
        ),
        role="Role ABC",
        metadata={
            "source": "network_discovery",
            "discovered_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
            "import_batch": "batch-123",
            "priority": 1,
            "verified": True,
        },
    )

    # Create an IP address with metadata
    ip_address = IPAddress(
        address="192.168.1.10/24",
        status="active",
        metadata={
            "last_scan": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
            "scan_id": "scan-456",
            "response_time": 23.5,
            "reachable": True,
            "owner_team": "network-ops",
        },
    )

    # Create a site with metadata
    site = Site(
        name="Data Center 1",
        status="active",
        metadata={
            "region": "us-west",
            "cost_center": "CC-001",
            "capacity": 500,
            "is_primary": True,
            "contact_email": "dc1-ops@example.com",
        },
    )

    entities = [Entity(device=device), Entity(ip_address=ip_address), Entity(site=site)]
    response = client.ingest(entities=entities)
    if response.errors:
        print(f"Errors: {response.errors}")
```

#### Adding request-level metadata

In addition to entity-level metadata, you can attach metadata to the entire ingestion request using the `metadata` keyword argument. This is useful for tracking information about the ingestion batch itself, such as the data source, batch ID, or processing context.

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeClient, Entity
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import Device, Site

with DiodeClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:8080/diode",
    app_name="my-app",
    app_version="1.0.0",
) as client:
    # Create device A
    device_a = Device(
        name="Device A",
        site=Site(name="Site ABC"),
    )

    # Create device B
    device_b = Device(
        name="Device B",
        site=Site(name="Site XYZ"),
    )

    entities = [Entity(device=device_a), Entity(device=device_b)]

    # Add request-level metadata to track the ingestion batch
    response = client.ingest(
        entities=entities,
        metadata={
            "batch_id": "import-2024-01-15",
            "source_system": "network_scanner",
            "import_type": "automated",
            "record_count": len(entities),
            "validated": True,
        },
    )
    if response.errors:
        print(f"Errors: {response.errors}")
```

Request-level metadata is included in the `IngestRequest` and can be useful for:
- Tracking data sources and ingestion pipelines
- Correlating entities within a batch
- Debugging and auditing data imports
- Adding contextual information for downstream processing

### TLS verification and certificates

TLS verification is controlled by the target URL scheme:
- **Secure schemes** (`grpcs://`, `https://`): TLS verification enabled
- **Insecure schemes** (`grpc://`, `http://`): TLS verification disabled

```python
# TLS verification enabled (uses system certificates)
client = DiodeClient(target="grpcs://example.com", ...)

# TLS verification disabled
client = DiodeClient(target="grpc://example.com", ...)
```

### Proxy support

The SDK automatically detects and uses HTTP/HTTPS proxies configured via standard environment variables:

```bash
# For insecure connections
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# For secure connections
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
# Falls back to HTTP_PROXY if HTTPS_PROXY is not set

# Bypass proxy for specific hosts
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com
```

**Important notes for proxy usage:**

1. **Proxy with SKIP_TLS_VERIFY**: When using HTTP(S) proxies, the SDK **always uses secure channels** because proxies require TLS for the CONNECT tunnel. Setting `DIODE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true` with a proxy will log a warning and use a secure channel anyway.

2. **MITM proxies (like mitmproxy)**: To use an intercepting proxy, you must provide the proxy's CA certificate:
   ```bash
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8080
   export DIODE_CERT_FILE=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
   ```

3. **Non-intercepting proxies**: Regular forwarding proxies work without additional configuration if the target server has a valid certificate trusted by system CAs.

Example with proxy:
```python
import os

# Configure proxy
os.environ["HTTPS_PROXY"] = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"

client = DiodeClient(
    target="grpcs://diode.example.com:443",
    app_name="my-app",
    app_version="1.0.0",
)
```

#### Using custom certificates

```python
# Via constructor parameter
client = DiodeClient(target="grpcs://example.com", cert_file="/path/to/cert.pem", ...)

# Or via environment variable
export DIODE_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
```

#### Disabling TLS verification

```bash
export DIODE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true
```

#### For legacy certificates (CN-only, no SANs)

```python
client = DiodeClient(
    target="grpcs://example.com",
    app_name="my-app",
    app_version="1.0.0",
    cert_file="/path/to/cert.pem",
    skip_tls_verify=True,
)
```

### Message chunking

When ingesting large numbers of entities, you may need to split them into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding the gRPC message size limit for a single `ingest()` call. The SDK provides chunking utilities that automatically split entity lists into appropriately sized chunks.

#### How it works

The SDK uses a **greedy bin-packing algorithm** that:
1. Accumulates entities until adding the next entity would exceed the size limit
2. Starts a new chunk when the limit would be exceeded
3. Ensures each chunk stays safely under the configured limit (default: 3 MB)

#### Basic usage

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeClient, create_message_chunks
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import Device, Entity

with DiodeClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:8080/diode",
    app_name="my-app",
    app_version="1.0.0",
) as client:
    # Create a large list of entities
    entities = []
    for i in range(10000):
        device = Device(
            name=f"Device {i}",
            device_type="Device Type A",
            site="Site ABC",
            role="Role ABC",
        )
        entities.append(Entity(device=device))

    # Split into chunks (default 3 MB per chunk), then ingest each chunk separately.
    for chunk in create_message_chunks(entities):
        client.ingest(entities=chunk)
```

#### Custom chunk size

You can customize the chunk size if needed:

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import create_message_chunks

# Use a larger chunk size (3.5 MB)
chunks = create_message_chunks(entities, max_chunk_size_mb=3.5)

# Use a smaller chunk size for conservative chunking (2 MB)
chunks = create_message_chunks(entities, max_chunk_size_mb=2.0)
```

#### Estimating message size

You can estimate the serialized size of entities before chunking:

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import estimate_message_size

size_bytes = estimate_message_size(entities)
size_mb = size_bytes / (1024 * 1024)
print(f"Total size: {size_mb:.2f} MB")

# Decide whether chunking is needed
if size_mb > 3.0:
    for chunk in create_message_chunks(entities):
        client.ingest(entities=chunk)
else:
    # Small enough to send in one request
    client.ingest(entities=entities)
```


### Dry run mode

`DiodeDryRunClient` generates ingestion requests without contacting a Diode server. Requests are printed to stdout by default, or written to JSON files when `output_dir` (or the `DIODE_DRY_RUN_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable) is specified. The `app_name` parameter serves as the filename prefix; if not provided, `dryrun` is used as the default prefix. The file name is suffixed with a nanosecond-precision timestamp, resulting in the format `<app_name>_<timestamp_ns>.json`.

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeDryRunClient

with DiodeDryRunClient(app_name="my_app", output_dir="/tmp") as client:
    client.ingest([
        Entity(device="Device A"),
    ])
```

The produced file can later be ingested by a real Diode instance using
`load_dryrun_entities` with a standard `DiodeClient` or via the bundled
`diode-replay-dryrun` helper:

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeClient, load_dryrun_entities

with DiodeClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:8080/diode",
    app_name="my-test-app",
    app_version="0.0.1",
) as client:
    entities = list(load_dryrun_entities("my_app_92722156890707.json"))
    client.ingest(entities=entities)
```

Alternatively, the same file can be ingested using the `diode-replay-dryrun`
command shipped with the SDK:

```bash
diode-replay-dryrun \
  --target grpc://localhost:8080/diode \
  --app-name my-test-app \
  --app-version 0.0.1 \
  my_app_92722156890707.json
```

#### Adding request-level metadata to dry run output

You can include request-level metadata in the dry run output using the `metadata` keyword argument. This metadata will be included in the JSON output file as part of the `IngestRequest`:

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeDryRunClient, Entity
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import Device

with DiodeDryRunClient(app_name="my_app", output_dir="/tmp") as client:
    # Add request-level metadata
    client.ingest(
        [Entity(device=Device(name="Device A"))],
        metadata={
            "batch_id": "import-2024-01",
            "source": "csv_import",
            "validated": True,
            "record_count": 150,
        }
    )
```

The resulting JSON file will include the metadata in the `IngestRequest`, making it visible when reviewing the dry run output.

### CLI to replay dry-run files

A small helper command is included to ingest JSON files created by the
`DiodeDryRunClient` and send them to a running Diode service.

Install the helper using `pip`:

```bash
pip install netboxlabs-diode-sdk
```

Run it by providing one or more JSON files and connection details. The command supports replaying multiple dry-run files in a single request:

```bash
diode-replay-dryrun \
  --file /tmp/my_app_92722156890707.json \
  --file /tmp/other.json \
  --target grpc://localhost:8080/diode \
  --app-name my-test-app \
  --app-version 0.0.1 \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

The `--file`, `--target`, `--app-name`, and `--app-version` arguments are required. You may
repeat `--file` to specify multiple files. OAuth2
credentials can be supplied using `--client-id` and `--client-secret` or the
`DIODE_CLIENT_ID` and `DIODE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

### OTLP client

`DiodeOTLPClient` converts ingestion entities into OpenTelemetry log records and exports them to an OTLP endpoint (gRPC). This is useful when a collector ingests log data and forwards it to Diode.

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import Entity, DiodeOTLPClient

with DiodeOTLPClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:4317",
    app_name="my-producer",
    app_version="0.0.1",
) as client:
    client.ingest([Entity(site="Site1")])
```

Each entity is serialised to JSON and sent as a log record with producer metadata so downstream collectors can enrich and forward the payload. The client raises `OTLPClientError` when the export fails. TLS behaviour honours the existing `DIODE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` and `DIODE_CERT_FILE` environment variables.

#### Adding request-level metadata as OTLP resource attributes

You can add request-level metadata to OTLP exports using the `metadata` keyword argument. This metadata is automatically mapped to OTLP resource attributes with a `diode.metadata.` prefix:

```python
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk import DiodeOTLPClient, Entity
from netboxlabs.diode.sdk.ingester import Site

with DiodeOTLPClient(
    target="grpc://localhost:4317",
    app_name="otlp-producer",
    app_version="1.0.0",
) as client:
    # Add request-level metadata
    client.ingest(
        [Entity(site=Site(name="Site 1"))],
        metadata={
            "environment": "production",
            "deployment": "us-west-2",
            "version": "1.2.3",
            "priority": 5,
        },
    )
```

The resulting OTLP log records will include resource attributes like:
- `diode.metadata.environment="production"`
- `diode.metadata.deployment="us-west-2"`
- `diode.metadata.version="1.2.3"`
- `diode.metadata.priority=5` (as integer)

These attributes are added alongside standard OTLP resource attributes (`service.name`, `service.version`, `diode.stream`, etc.), allowing downstream collectors and observability platforms to filter, route, and enrich the data based on this metadata.
