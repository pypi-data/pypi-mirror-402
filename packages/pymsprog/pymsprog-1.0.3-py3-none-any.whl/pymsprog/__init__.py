def load_toy_data():
    '''
    Load the example longitudinal MS dataset provided with ``pymsprog``.

    This toy dataset is intended for testing and demonstration purposes.
    It provides artificially generated Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and
    Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) longidutinal scores, visit dates, and relapse onset dates
    in a small cohort of example patients to illustrate the use of the package.

    Returns
    -------
    (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame)
        A ``visits`` sheet containing disability info, and a ``relapses`` sheet containing
        relapse info.

    Notes
    -----
    The dataset is loaded from an Excel file (``MSprog_toydata.xlsx``) bundled with the package.
    The ``visits`` sheet includes the following columns.

    - ``id``: subject identifier.
    - ``date``: visit date.
    - ``EDSS``: EDSS score.
    - ``SDMT``: SDMT score.

    The ``relapses`` sheet includes the following columns.

    - ``id``: subject identifier.
    - ``date``: relapse onset date.

    Examples

    '''

    Assess multiple sclerosis disability course from longitudinal data.

    The function detects and characterises the confirmed disability worsening (CDW)
    or improvement (CDI) events of an outcome measure (EDSS, NHPT, T25FW, or SDMT; or any custom outcome)
    for one or more subjects, based on repeated assessments
    through time (and on the dates of acute episodes, if any).
    Several qualitative and quantitative options are given as arguments that can be set
    by the user and reported as a complement to the results to ensure reproducibility.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID, outcome value, date of visit.

    subj_col: str
        Name of data column with subject ID.

    value_col: str
        Name of data column with outcome value.

    date_col: str
        Name of data column with date of visit.

    outcome: str
        Outcome type. Must be one of the following.

        - 'edss' (Expanded Disability Status Scale)
        - 'nhpt' (Nine-Hole Peg Test)
        - 't25fw' (Timed 25-Foot Walk)
        - 'sdmt' (Symbol Digit Modalities Test)
        - None (only accepted when specifying custom ``delta_fun`` and ``worsening``).

        Outcome type determines a default direction of worsening (see ``worsening`` argument)
        and default definition of clinically meaningful change given the reference value
        (using the built-in function :func:`compute_delta()`).

    relapse: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID and relapse onset dates (if any).

    rsubj_col: str
        Name of subject ID column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    rdate_col: str
        Name of onset date column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    subjects: array-like
        Subset of subject IDs to analyse. If none is specified, all subjects listed in ``data`` are included.

    delta_fun: function
        Custom function specifying the minimum clinically meaningful change
        in the outcome measure from the provided reference value.
        The function provided must take a numeric value (reference score) as input,
        and return a numeric value corresponding to the minimum shift from baseline.
        If none is specified (default), the user must provide a non-None value for
        the ``outcome`` argument (see above) in order to use the built-in function :func:`compute_delta()`.

    worsening: str
        The direction of worsening ('increase' if higher values correspond to worse disease course, 'decrease' otherwise).
        This argument is only used when ``outcome`` is set to None. Otherwise, ``worsening`` is automatically set to
        'increase' if ``outcome`` is set to 'edss', 'nhpt', 't25fw', and to 'decrease' if ``outcome`` is set to 'sdmt'.

    valuedelta_col: str
        Name of data column with alternative outcome value to use as baseline for delta function.
        It may be used, for instance, when analysing *partial* disability trajectories extracted
        using :func:`separate_ri_ra()`.
        Example:\n
        Original trajectory: EDSS = 3, 3.5, 5.5, 5, 5, 5.5, 6\n
        Relapse-independent trajectory: RIEDSS = 3, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4, 4.5 (obtained using :func:`separate_ri_ra()`)\n
        To extract progression events from the relapse-independent trajectory, the delta function should be referred
        to the original EDSS values (e.g., the worsening of 0.5 from 4 to 4.5 should be considered valid because
        the actual disability score of the patient went from 5.5 to 6).
        In such a case, :func:`MSprog()` should be used with ``value_col='RIEDSS'`` and ``valuedelta_col='EDSS'``.

    event: str
        Specifies which events to detect. Must be one of the following.

        - 'firstCDW' (first CDW, default)
        - 'firstCDI' (first CDI)
        - 'first' (only the very first confirmed event -- CDI or CDW)
        - 'firstPIRA' (first PIRA);
        - 'firstRAW' (first RAW);
        - 'multiple' (all confirmed events in chronological order).

    baseline: str
        Specifies the baseline scheme. Must be one of the following.

        - 'fixed': first valid outcome value, default;
        - 'roving_impr': updated after every CDI (to the visit determined by ``proceed_from``);
          suitable for a first-CDW setting to discard fluctuations around baseline -- not recommended for randomised data;
        - 'roving_wors': updated after every CDW (to the visit determined by ``proceed_from``);
          suitable when searching for a specific type of CDW (i.e., when ``event`` is set to 'firstPIRA' or 'firstRAW');
        - 'roving': updated after each CDI or CDW event to the visit determined by ``proceed_from``;
          suitable for a multiple-event setting (i.e., when ``event`` is set to 'multiple')
          or when searching for a specific type of CDW (i.e., when ``event`` is set to 'firstPIRA' or 'firstRAW')
          -- not recommended for randomised data.

    proceed_from: str
        After detecting a confirmed disability event, continue searching:

        - from the next visit after the first qualifying confirmation visit if ``proceed_from='firstconf'``;
        - from the next visit after the event if ``proceed_from='event'``.

        If ``baseline`` is set to 'roving', 'roving_impr', or 'roving_wors', when rebaselining after a
        confirmed disability event, the baseline is moved to:

        - the first qualifying confirmation visit if ``proceed_from='firstconf'``;
        - the event visit if ``proceed_from='event'``.

    sub_threshold_rebl: str
        This argument is only used if ``baseline`` is not set to 'fixed'.
        Must be one of the following.

        - 'event': any confirmed sub-threshold event (i.e., any *confirmed* change in the outcome measure,
          possibly below clinically meaningful threshold) can potentially trigger a re-baseline;
        - 'improvement': any confirmed sub-threshold improvement (i.e., any *confirmed* improvement
          in the outcome measure, possibly below clinically meaningful threshold) can potentially trigger a re-baseline;
        - 'worsening': any confirmed sub-threshold worsening (i.e., any *confirmed* worsening in the
          outcome measure, possibly below clinically meaningful threshold) can potentially trigger a re-baseline;
        - 'none': only use clinically meaningful confirmed changes for rebaseline.
         See ``delta_fun`` argument and function :func:`compute_delta()` for more details.

    bl_geq: bool
        This argument is only used if the baseline is moved.
        If True, the new reference value must always be greater or equal than the previous one;
        when it is not, the old reference value is assigned to it [Kappos JAMA Neurol 2020].

    relapse_rebl: bool
        If True, re-baseline after every relapse.

    skip_local_extrema: str
        This argument is only used when moving the baseline. It controls re-baseline behaviour
        in the presence of local minima or maxima of the outcome trajectory.
        A visit ``i`` is a local minimum point for ``outcome`` if ``outcome[i+1]>outcome[i]`` and ``outcome[i-1]>outcome[i]``;
        local maxima are defined similarly.\n
        A visit ``i`` is a *strict* local minimum point for ``outcome`` if:\n
        ``outcome[i+1]-outcome[i]>=delta_fun(outcome[i])``;\n
        ``outcome[i-1]-outcome[i]>=delta_fun(outcome[i])``.\n
        Strict local maxima are defined similarly.\n
        When ``outcome[i]=outcome[i-2]``, visit ``i`` is *not* considered a local extremum point even if the above conditions hold.
        This controls for cases where the outcome has an undulating course.\n
        The following argument values are accepted.
        
        - 'none': local extrema are always accepted as valid baseline values;
        - 'strict': the baseline cannot be placed at a *strict* local minimum or maximum;
        - 'all': the baseline cannot be placed at a local minimum or maximum.

    validconf_col: str
        Name of data column specifying which visits can (True) or cannot (False) be used as confirmation visits.
        The input data does not necessarily have to include such a column.
        If not specified (``validconf_col=None``), all visits are potentially used as confirmation visits.

    conf_days: int, float, or array-like
        Period before confirmation (days). Can be a single value or array-like of any length if multiple
        windows are to be considered.

    conf_tol_days: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2, or dict
        Tolerance window for confirmation visit (days); can be a single value (same tolerance on left and right)
        or array-like of length 2 (different tolerance on left and right).
        The right end of the interval can be set to ``float('inf')`` (confirmation window unbounded on the right
        -- e.g., "confirmed over 12 *or more* weeks").
        It can also be given as a dictionary with the values in ``conf_days`` as keys
        and different tolerance windows as values.

    require_sust_days: int or float
        Minimum number of days over which a confirmed change must be sustained
        (i.e., confirmed at *all* visits occurring in the specified period) to be retained as an event.
        Events sustained for the remainder of the follow-up period are always retained regardless of follow-up duration.
        Setting ``require_sust_days=float('inf')``, events are retained only when sustained for the remainder of the follow-up period.
        (Warning: if ``check_intermediate`` is set to False, sustained change will be established based
        *only on the end* of the specified period.)

    check_intermediate: bool
        If True (default), events are confirmed *over all intermediate visits* up to the confirmation visit.
        If set to False (not recommended in most cases, as it may discard meaningful fluctuations),
        events will be confirmed *only at* the specified confirmation visit
        (and *only at the end* of the period defined by ``require_sust_days``, if any).

    relapse_to_bl: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for a visit to be used as baseline.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means keeping the baseline where it is regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).
        If the designated baseline does not respect this constraint, the baseline is moved to the next available visit.

    relapse_to_event: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for an event to be considered as such.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means retaining the event regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).

    relapse_to_conf: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for a visit to be a valid confirmation visit.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means using any visit for confirmation regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).

    relapse_assoc: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Maximum distance from a relapse (days) for a CDW event to be classified as RAW.
        Can be a single value (maximum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (maximum distance from *last* relapse, maximum distance from *next* relapse).
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the maximum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration.

    relapse_indep: dict
        Specifies relapse-free intervals for PIRA definition. Must be given in the form:
        ``{'prec': (p0, p1), 'event': (e0, e1), 'conf': (c0, c1)}``.
        The dictionary specifies the intervals around (any subset of) the three checkpoints:

        - 'prec': a visit preceding the event -- see below;
        - 'event': the disability worsening event onset;
        - 'conf': the first available confirmation visit.

        The dictionary can also optionally contain a key-value pair specifying how to choose 'prec':

        - ``'prec_type': 'baseline'`` → 'prec' is the current baseline;
        - ``'prec_type': 'last'`` → 'prec' is the last visit before event onset;
        - ``'prec_type': 'last_lower'`` → 'prec' is the last visit before event onset
          with a clinically meaningful score distance from the event score:
          ``i`` such that ``outcome[event] - outcome[i] >= delta_fun(outcome[i])``
          (if ``worsening='increase'``, the opposite otherwise)
          and same for the confirmation visit.
        
        If 'prec_type' is not in the dictionary keys, 'prec' is assumed to be the current baseline.

        If both ends of an interval are 0 (e.g., if both ``p0=0`` and ``p1=0``), the checkpoint is ignored.
        If the right end is None, the interval is assumed to extend up to the left end of the next interval.
        If the left end is None, the interval is assumed to extend up to the right end of the previous interval.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), it is possible to also define PIRA based on those...

    impute_last_visit: float or int
        Imputation probability for worsening events occurring at last visit (i.e. with no confirmation).
        Unconfirmed worsening events occurring at the last visit are never imputed if ``impute_last_visit=0``;
        they are always imputed if ``impute_last_visit=1``;
        they are imputed with probability ``p``, ``0<p<1``, if ``impute_last_visit=p``.
        If a value ``N>1`` is passed, unconfirmed worsening events are imputed only if occurring within
        ``N`` days of follow-up (e.g., in case of early discontinuation).

    include_dates: bool
        If True, the ``results`` DataFrame will include the date of each event ('date' column)
        and the date of the corresponding baseline ('bldate' column).

    include_value: bool
        If True, the ``results`` DataFrame will include the outcome value at each event ('value' column)
        and at the corresponding baseline ('blvalue' column).

    include_stable: bool
        If True, subjects with no confirmed events are included in the ``results`` DataFrame,
        with 'time2event' = total follow up.

    return_unconfirmed: bool
        If True, return an additional DataFrame including unconfirmed changes.

    verbose: int
        One of: 0 (print no info); 1 (print concise info, default); 2 (print extended info).

    Returns
    -------
    (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame)
         - ``summary``: summary of detected events for each subject;
         - ``results``: extended info on event sequence for each subject;
         - (if ``return_unconfirmed=True``) ``unconfirmed``: unconfirmed changes.

    Notes
    -----
    The events are detected sequentially by scanning the outcome values in chronological order.
    Time windows for confirmation visits are determined by arguments
    ``conf_days``, ``conf_tol_days``, ``relapse_to_conf``.
    CDW events are classified as relapse-associated or relapse-independent based on their relative timing
    with respect to the relapses. Specifically, relapse-associated worsening (RAW) events are defined as
    CDW events occurring within a specified interval (``relapse_assoc`` argument) from a relapse;
    the definition of progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) is established
    by specifying relapse-free intervals (``relapse_indep`` argument).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the arguments are incorrectly specified.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> toydata_visits, toydata_relapses = load_toy_data()
    >>> # 1. EDSS course
    >>> summary, results = MSprog(toydata_visits, relapse=toydata_relapses, subj_col='id', value_col='EDSS', date_col='date', outcome='edss')
    >>> # 1. SDMT course
    >>> summary, results = MSprog(toydata_visits, relapse=toydata_relapses, subj_col='id', value_col='EDSS', date_col='date', outcome='sdmt')

     outcome: str
        Outcome type (one of: 'edss','nhpt','t25fw','sdmt', None).

     delta_fun: function
        Custom function specifying the minimum clinically meaningful change

        The function provided must take a numeric value (reference score) as input,
        and return a numeric value corresponding to the minimum shift from baseline.
        If none is specified (default), the user must provide a non-None value for
        the ``outcome`` argument (see above) in order to use the built-in function :func:`compute_delta()`.
        The argument is ignored if ``sub_threshold=True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID, outcome value, date of visit.

    milestone: float
        Disability milestone (outcome value to check data against).

        Name of data column with subject ID.

    value_col: str
        Name of data column with outcome value.

    date_col: str
        Name of data column with date of visit.

    outcome: str
        Outcome type. Must be one of the following.

        - 'edss' (Expanded Disability Status Scale)
        - 'nhpt' (Nine-Hole Peg Test)
        - 't25fw' (Timed 25-Foot Walk)
        - 'sdmt' (Symbol Digit Modalities Test)
        - None (only accepted when specifying a custom ``worsening``).

        Outcome type determines a default direction of worsening (see ``worsening`` argument).

    relapse: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID and relapse date (can be omitted).

    rsubj_col: str
        Name of subject ID column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    rdate_col: str
        Name of onset date column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    worsening: str
        The direction of worsening ('increase' if higher values correspond to worse disease course, 'decrease' otherwise).
        This argument is only used when ``outcome`` is set to None. Otherwise, ``worsening`` is automatically set to
        'increase' if ``outcome`` is set to 'edss', 'nhpt', 't25fw', and to 'decrease' if ``outcome`` is set to 'sdmt'.

    validconf_col: str
        Name of data column specifying which visits can (True) or cannot (False) be used as confirmation visits.
        The input data does not necessarily have to include such a column.
        If not specified (``validconf_col=None``), all visits are potentially used as confirmation visits.

    conf_days: int, float, or array-like
        Period before confirmation (days). Can be a single value or array-like of any length if multiple
        windows are to be considered.

    conf_tol_days: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Tolerance window for confirmation visit (days); can be a single value (same tolerance on left and right)
        or array-like of length 2 (different tolerance on left and right).
        The right end of the interval can be set to ``float('inf')`` (confirmation window unbounded on the right
        -- e.g., "confirmed over 12 *or more* weeks").

    require_sust_days: int or float
        Minimum number of days over which the milestone must be sustained.
        (i.e., confirmed at *all* visits occurring in the specified period) to be retained.
        If the milestone is sustained for the remainder of the follow-up period, it is always considered reached regardless of follow-up duration.
        If ``require_sust_days=float('inf')``, milestone is considered reached only when sustained for the remainder of the follow-up period.

    relapse_to_event: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for an event to be considered as such.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means retaining the event regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).

    relapse_to_conf: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for a visit to be a valid confirmation visit.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means using any visit for confirmation regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).

    impute_last_visit: float or int
        Imputation probability for milestone reached at last visit (i.e. with no confirmation).
        If ``impute_last_visit=0``, milestone is never imputed (i.e., considered reached) if the value is attained at the last visit;
        if ``impute_last_visit=1``, it is always imputed; if ``impute_last_visit=p``, ``0<p<1``, it is imputed with probability ``p``.
        If a value ``N>1`` is passed, milestone is imputed only if occurring within
        ``N`` days of follow-up (e.g., in case of early discontinuation).

    verbose: int
        One of: 0 (print no info); 1 (print concise info); 1 (print extended info).

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Including columns:

        - ``date_col`` -- date of first reaching or exceeding the milestone (or last date of follow-up if milestone is not reached);
        - ``value_col`` -- first value reaching or exceeding the milestone, if present;
        - 'time2event' -- the time taken to reach or exceed the milestone (or total follow-up length if milestone is not reached);
        - 'observed' -- whether the milestone was reached (1) or not (0).

    Notes
    -----
    An event is only retained if **confirmed**, i.e., if all values *up to* the
    confirmation visit reach or exceed the milestone.
    Time windows for confirmation visits are determined by arguments
    ``conf_days``, ``conf_tol_days``, ``relapse_to_conf``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the arguments are incorrectly specified.

    Given longitudinal disability assessments and relapse dates, decompose
    the disability trajectory into a relapse-associated component (RAC)
    and a relapse-independent component (RIC).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID, outcome value, date of visit.

    subj_col: str
        Name of data column with subject ID.

    value_col: str
        Name of data column with outcome value.

    date_col: str
        Name of data column with date of visit.

    outcome: str
        Outcome type. Must be one of the following:

        - 'edss' (Expanded Disability Status Scale)
        - 'nhpt' (Nine-Hole Peg Test)
        - 't25fw' (Timed 25-Foot Walk)
        - 'sdmt' (Symbol Digit Modalities Test)
        - None (only accepted when specifying custom ``delta_fun`` and ``worsening``)

        Outcome type determines a default direction of worsening (see ``worsening`` argument)
        and default definition of clinically meaningful change given the reference value
        (using the built-in function :func:`compute_delta()`).

    relapse: pandas.DataFrame
        Longitudinal data containing subject ID and relapse date.

    rsubj_col: str
        Name of subject ID column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    rdate_col: str
        Name of onset date column for relapse data, if different from outcome data.

    delta_fun: function
        Custom function specifying the minimum clinically meaningful change
        in the outcome measure from the provided reference value.
        The function provided must take a numeric value (reference score) as input,
        and return a numeric value corresponding to the minimum shift from baseline.
        If none is specified (default), the user must provide a non-None value for
        the ``outcome`` argument (see above) in order to use the built-in function :func:`compute_delta()`.

    worsening: str
        The direction of worsening ('increase' if higher values correspond to worse disease course, 'decrease' otherwise).
        This argument is only used when ``outcome`` is set to None. Otherwise, ``worsening`` is automatically set to
        'increase' if ``outcome`` is set to 'edss', 'nhpt', 't25fw', and to 'decrease' if ``outcome`` is set to 'sdmt'.

    validconf_col: str
        Name of data column specifying which visits can (True) or cannot (False) be used as confirmation visits.
        The input data does not necessarily have to include such a column.
        If not specified (``validconf_col=None``), all visits are potentially used as confirmation visits.

    conf_days: int, float, or array-like
        Period before confirmation (days). Can be a single value or array-like of any length if multiple
        windows are to be considered.

    conf_tol_days: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Tolerance window for confirmation visit (days); can be a single value (same tolerance on left and right)
        or array-like of length 2 (different tolerance on left and right).
        The right end of the interval can be set to ``float('inf')`` (confirmation window unbounded on the right
        -- e.g., "confirmed over 12 *or more* weeks").

    sust_raw_days: int or float
        Minimum number of days over which a confirmed RAW event must be maintained
        (i.e., confirmed at *all* visits occurring in the specified period) to be considered as "sustained RAW".
        Events confirmed for the remainder of the follow-up period are always considered sustained
        even if follow-up duration is shorter than ``sust_raw_days``.
        Setting ``sust_raw_days=float('inf')``, events are considered sustained only if the change is maintained
        for the remainder of the follow-up period.

    relapse_to_bl: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for a visit to be used as baseline.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means keeping the baseline where it is regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).
        If the designated baseline does not respect this constraint, the baseline is moved to the next available visit.

    relapse_to_conf: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Minimum distance from a relapse (days) for a visit to be a valid confirmation visit.
        Can be a single value (minimum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (minimum distance from *last* relapse, minimum distance from *next* relapse).
        Note that setting the distance to zero means using any visit for confirmation regardless of surrounding relapses.
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the minimum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration, unless it was set to zero (in which case it stays 0).

    relapse_assoc: int, float, or array-like of length 1 or 2
        Maximum distance from a relapse (days) for a CDW event to be classified as RAW.
        Can be a single value (maximum distance from *last* relapse) or array-like of length 2
        (maximum distance from *last* relapse, maximum distance from *next* relapse).
        # If relapse end dates are available (``renddate_col``), the maximum distance from last relapse
        # is overwritten by the relapse duration.

    impute_last_visit: float or int
        Imputation probability for RAW events occurring at last visit (i.e. with no confirmation).
        Unconfirmed worsening events occurring at the last visit are never imputed if ``impute_last_visit=0``;
        they are always imputed if ``impute_last_visit=1``;
        they are imputed with probability ``p``, ``0<p<1``, if ``impute_last_visit=p``.
        If a value ``N>1`` is passed, unconfirmed worsening events are imputed only if occurring within
        ``N`` days of follow-up (e.g., in case of early discontinuation).

    subtract_bl: bool
        If True, the returned DataFrame will also include (``f'{value_col}-bl'`` column) the overall change
        in score from baseline (simply obtained by subtracting the overall baseline from ``data[value_col]``).

    include_rel_num: bool
        If True, the returned DataFrame will include the cumulative number of relapses ('relapse_num' column)
        at all visits of each subject.

    include_bl: bool
        If True, the returned DataFrame will include the baseline outcome value (``f'bl{value_col}'`` column)
        for each subject.

    include_raw_dates: bool
        If True, an additional DataFrame is returned containing the dates of detected RAW events
        for each subject.

    verbose: int
        One of: 0 (print no info); 1 (print concise info, default); 2 (print extended info).

    Returns
    -------
        pandas.DataFrame or (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame)
        The original DataFrame (``data``) is returned with the addition of the following columns:

        - ``f'ric_{value_col}'``: cumulative relapse-independent change from baseline
        - ``f'srac_{value_col}'``: cumulative sustained relapse-associated change from baseline
        - ``f'bumps_{value_col}'``: transient relapse-associated changes (bumps)
        - ``f'bl_{value_col}'``: baseline score (if ``include_bl=True``)
        - 'relapse_num': cumulative relapse number (if ``include_rel_num=True``)

        If ``include_raw_dates=True``, an additional DataFrame containing the dates of detected
        RAW events for each subject is also returned.

    Notes
    -----
    For each subject, the function analyses the disability assessments surrounding each relapse
    to look for a *confirmed* worsening in the disability score within the influence period of
    the relapse (as per ``relapse_assoc[0]``) with respect to the last visit preceding the relapse
    (at a distance specified by ``relapse_assoc[1]``). If such a worsening is found,
    it is labelled as a relapse-associated worsening (RAW) event.

    The change in score resulting from each RAW event is subtracted from the overall trajectory to isolate PIRA.
    If a RAW event is sustained for a specified period of time (as per ``sust_raw_days`` argument),
    the accumulation of disability is considered permanent and the change is subtracted from all subsequent
    visits. The change is computed as the minimum score over the sustained period; any temporary
    worsening exceeding the change is considered as a "bump", and is only subtracted from the score of
    the current assessment. If a RAW event is transient (not sustained), the change is only
    subtracted from all scores up to the confirmation visit.
    Three sub-trajectories are obtained:

    - RAC (permanent accumulation of disability from sustained RAW);
    - "bumps" (temporary disability worsening from transient RAW);
    - RIC (disability accumulation due to PIRA, obtained as the trajectory of disability worsening
      deprived of all sustained and transient relapse-associated contributions).

    All sub-trajectories are expressed as deltas relative to the baseline value,
    as the disability already accumulated at the beginning of the follow-up period
    cannot be attributed to relapse-associated or relapse-independent CDW
    with the available data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the arguments are incorrectly specified.
