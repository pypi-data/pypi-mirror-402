"""
boot.py — System boot primitive.

The <boot> message is the first message in every organism's lifetime.
It establishes the root thread from which all other threads descend.

The boot handler:
1. Logs organism startup
2. Initializes any system-level state

All external messages that arrive without a known thread parent
will be registered as children of the boot thread.

Note: The SecureConsole (v3.0) handles the console directly, so the boot
handler no longer sends to a console listener.
