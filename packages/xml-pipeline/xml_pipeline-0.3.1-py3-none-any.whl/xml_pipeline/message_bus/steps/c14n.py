"""
c14n.py — Canonicalization step for the full <message> envelope.

After repair, the envelope_tree may have different but semantically equivalent
representations (attribute order, namespace prefixes, whitespace, etc.).

This step produces Exclusive XML Canonicalization (C14N 1.1) bytes that are
identical for equivalent documents — essential for validation and signing.

Part of AgentServer v2.1 message pump.

    Canonicalize the envelope_tree to Exclusive C14N form.

    If repair_step succeeded, this step normalizes the tree so that:
      - Validation against envelope.xsd is deterministic
      - Future signing/federation comparisons are reliable

    On failure, sets state.error and continues (downstream steps will short-circuit).
