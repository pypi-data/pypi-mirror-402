"""
platform — Trusted orchestration layer for the agent swarm.

The platform manages:
- Prompt registry: immutable system prompts per agent
- LLM call assembly: platform controls what goes to the LLM
- Context buffer access: controlled by platform

Agents are sandboxed. They receive messages and return responses.
They cannot see or modify prompts, and cannot directly access the LLM.
