"""
memory — Virtual memory management for AI agents.

Provides thread-scoped, append-only context buffers with:
- Immutable slots (handlers can't modify messages)
- Thread isolation (handlers only see their context)
- Complete audit trail (all messages preserved)
- GC and limits (prevent runaway memory usage)
