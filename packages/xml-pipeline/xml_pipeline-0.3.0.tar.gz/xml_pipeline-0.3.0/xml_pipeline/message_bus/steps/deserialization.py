deserialization.py — Convert validated payload_tree into typed dataclass instance.

After xsd_validation_step confirms the payload conforms to the contract,
this step uses our customized xmlable routines to deserialize the lxml Element
directly in memory — no temporary files needed.

Part of AgentServer v2.1 message pump.
