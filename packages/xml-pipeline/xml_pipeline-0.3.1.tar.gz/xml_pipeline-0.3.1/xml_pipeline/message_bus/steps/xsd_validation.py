"""
xsd_validation.py — Validate the extracted payload against the listener-specific XSD.

After payload_extraction_step isolates the payload_tree and provenance,
this step validates the payload against the XSD that was auto-generated
from the listener's @xmlify dataclass at registration time.

The XSD is cached and pre-loaded. The schema object is injected into
state.metadata["schema"] when the listener's pipeline is built.

Failure here means the payload violates the declared contract — we collect
detailed errors for diagnostics.

Part of AgentServer v2.1 message pump.
