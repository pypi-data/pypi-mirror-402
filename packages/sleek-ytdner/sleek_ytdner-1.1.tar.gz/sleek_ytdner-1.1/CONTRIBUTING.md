## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/hslcrb/pypack_sleek_a-ytdownloader-pkg/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hslcrb/pypack_sleek_a-ytdownloader-pkg/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as well as as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Describe the step-by-step behavior you expect to see.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.

### Your First Code Contribution

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`.
3. **Install in editable mode**: `pip install -e .` (This allows you to test changes immediately).
4. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
5. Push to the original branch: `git push origin my-feature-branch`.
6. Create the pull request.

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- **Bilingual (English/Korean)** commit messages are appreciated but not required.

### Coding Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Keep it clean, semantic, and commented where necessary.
