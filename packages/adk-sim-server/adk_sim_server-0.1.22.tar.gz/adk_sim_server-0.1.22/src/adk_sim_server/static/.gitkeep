# Static files directory

This directory contains bundled frontend assets when running the ADK Agent
Simulator. The server expects the Angular app to be in `browser/index.html`.

During development, the frontend is served separately by Angular's dev server.

To bundle the frontend for production:
1. Build the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
2. Copy the built files: `cp -r frontend/dist/frontend/* server/src/adk_sim_server/static/`

Or simply run: `ops build frontend`

The CI publish workflow automatically bundles the frontend before building
the Python wheel, ensuring published packages always include the frontend.

Directory structure after bundling:

    browser/
      index.html      <- Angular SPA entry point
      main-*.js       <- Bundled JavaScript
      styles-*.css    <- Bundled CSS
      media/          <- Fonts, icons, etc.
