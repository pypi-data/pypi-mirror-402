"""Event broadcaster for session event pub/sub.

Provides a pub/sub mechanism for broadcasting session events to
multiple subscribers. Each session has its own set of subscribers,
and events are broadcast to all subscribers for that session.

Includes per-session locking to ensure atomic history retrieval
and subscriber registration, preventing race conditions where events
could be missed during the subscription process.
