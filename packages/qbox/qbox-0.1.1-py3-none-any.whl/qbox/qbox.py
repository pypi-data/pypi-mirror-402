        This method forces evaluation, blocking until the async operation
        completes. After evaluation, the result is cached.

        Returns:
            Truncated value of the wrapped result.

        Raises:
            Exception: Any exception from the wrapped coroutine.
            TypeError: If the wrapped value doesn't support trunc.

        result = math.trunc(cast("Any", self.__wrapped__))
        return int(result)
