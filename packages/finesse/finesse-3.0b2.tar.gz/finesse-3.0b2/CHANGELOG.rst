 Changelog
###########

This changelog describes the changes made between the different alpha versions of
|Finesse|. When seeing unexpected behavior with existing finesse scripts after updating,
you should read the entries between the last working version and the version introducing
the issues, to see if there are any entries that are relevant to your code. See
:ref:`updating_finesse` for instructions on how to update to the latest version.

.. note::

   You are currently looking at the documentation for |Finesse| |release|. Some of the
   changes listed for older versions may no longer be relevant, or contain broken links
   to non-existing documentation pages.

**************************************************************
`3.0b2 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0b2/>`_ (2026-01-20)
**************************************************************

Removed
=======

- Support for python 3.10 (following `NEP 29
  <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table>`_)


****************************************************************
`3.0b1 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0b1/>`_ (2026-01-09)
****************************************************************

Changed
=======

- Reorganisation and rewrite of the documenation (work-in-progress)
- The data generated by the :ref:`cameras <cameras_usage>` are now ordered such that the
  first index corresponds to the y axis and the second index to the x axis -> data[y,
  x].


Added
=====

- New :ref:`documentation page <readouts>` and docstrings for the readout components.
- Better error messages for :issue:`711`, modulator signal injection is only partly
  implemented
- Possibility to parse katscripts and file at :class:`finesse.model.Model` initialisation
- :meth:`finesse.model.Model.parse` (and associated methods) now return the :class:`finesse.model.Model` object
- Model.parse* now return Self to allows command chaining.
- Release dates in the changelog

Fixed
=====

- Fixed issue :issue:`775`: several tests failed with numpy 2.4.0 since we
  relied on long deprecated behaviour.
- Fix trivial typo that broke the :class:`finesse.components.modulator.Modulator`
  ``positive_only`` option.
- Fixed issue :issue:`745`: "Vacuum" material had the same name as FusedSilica.
- Fixed issue :issue:`654`: Preventing doubly connected readout components.
- Fixed :attr:`finesse.components.dof.DegreeOfFreedom.dc_enabled`

  with ArraySolution filling if the detector shape changes after initialisation
- Fixed issue with `finesse_sphinx` creating memory leak when the doc was build
  multiple time in successions.

Removed
=======

- Removed runtime compatibility checks related to numpy v2


****************************************************************
`3.0a33 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a33/>`_ (2025-05-15)
****************************************************************

Changed
=======

- The handling of the RTL relationship for :class:`finesse.components.mirror.Mirror` and
  :class:`finesse.components.beamsplitter.Beamsplitter` has been improved. Energy
  conservation is now checked at every parameter update and when supplying 2 out of 3
  values, the third one is automatically set to a symbolic expression to make sure
  :math:`R + T + L = 1`. See :ref:`rtl_relationship` for more details and examples.
- :class:`finesse.components.general.Connector` components no longer assume that an
  identity ABCD matrix is the default. This means that if you have a connector that does
  not specify its ABCD matrix for each optical connection, you may see a
  :class:`finesse.exceptions.NoABCDCoupling` exception raised now, when you would not
  have before.
- Improving Python error messages when strings are given as node names.

Added
=====

- Added new :class:`finesse.components.telescope.Telescope` component which represents
  an ideal telescope between to parts of an optical system. For example, it allows the
  use to perfectly mode match two cavities without needing to design or specify the
  exact telescope details.
- `Connector._trace_through` has been added as an
  internal flag to stop the beam tracer from trying to trace through a connector. This
  can be used for components like :class:`finesse.components.telescope.Telescope`, which
  only connect optical fields and shouldn't allow beam tracing through it as it isn't
  well defined. Or the user could use this to fix a place that a mismatch should occur.
- Added an option to specify the transmission and reflection conventions for
  :class:`finesse.components.mirror.Mirror` and
  :class:`finesse.components.beamsplitter.Beamsplitter`. The transmission and
  reflection phase relationship can be changed by setting the
  ``imaginary_transmission`` argument to either real or imaginary. By default this is
  imaginary (True), so a :math:`\I` phase on transmission. If set to be the real
  convention then the phase is 0 on transmission and 180 degrees on reflection
  on the port 1 side.

Removed
=======

- ``zero_tem00_gouy`` optional argument was removed from :class:`finesse.cymath.homs.HGModes`
  constructor as it was not being used internally or elsewhere.

Fixed
=====

- Fixed issue :issue:`699` by giving :class:`finesse.components.readout.ReadoutRF`
  a default frequency value of ``f=0``.
- Fixed passing arguments in the wrong order to :meth:`finesse.model.Model.link` not
  raising an exception.
- Improved exception messages from the beam tracer to removed "bug encountered!"
  which wasn't true in many cases. BeamTraceExceptions are now thrown with
  more useful messages to the user.

****************************************************************
`3.0a32 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a32/>`_ (2025-03-20)
****************************************************************

Fixed
=====
- :class:`finesse.components.modulator.Modulator` and
  :class:`finesse.components.nothing.Nothing` were not correctly handling mismatches
  changing during a simulation across their nodes which is now fixed.
- Nested :class:`finesse.solutions.array.ArraySolution` s did not work correctly as
  :class:`finesse.solutions.array.ArraySolution` memoryviews were being held on a
  workspace basis. So running a :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.axes.Noxaxis` in a
  :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.axes.Xaxis` would conflict which memoryview was being
  used.
- Fixed not having the ``IPython`` library installed preventing you from importing
  |Finesse|
- Fixed incompatibility with new major ``IPython`` release (9.0)
- Fixed signal :ref:`modelling example <signal_example>` to use the `pwr` node instead
  of the `amp` node on the laser
- Fixed bug report functionality for python 3.13 (:ref:`reporting_issues`)
- Fixed :meth:`finesse.model.Model.plot_graph` not working in a notebook environment
- Fixed carrier simulation not being ran when running an optimizer on a
  :class:`finesse.detectors.bpdetector.BeamPropertyDetector`

Added
=====

- `MR !288 <https://gitlab.com/ifosim/finesse/finesse3/-/merge_requests/288>`_ adds
  ring heater thermal deformation calculations to the thermal module. See
  :mod:`finesse.thermal.ring_heater` for more information.
- `MR !289 <https://gitlab.com/ifosim/finesse/finesse3/-/merge_requests/289>`_
  allows model to be pickled for storing. Should only be used for short term storage of
  a model, as it is not guaranteed to be compatible with future versions or across
  different platforms or systems. See :ref:`serialisation_python`
- Missing katscript documentation for :ref:`alens_katscript` component

Changes
-------
- Added ``ipykernel`` as doc build dependency as that doesn't seem to get installed now
  through other dependencies and leads to the doc build complaining that python3 doesn't
  exist.

****************************************************************
`3.0a31 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a31/>`_ (2025-01-23)
****************************************************************

Added
=====

- Wheels for linux/macos 3.13

****************************************************************
`3.0a30 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a30/>`_ (2025-01-23)
****************************************************************

Added
=====

- :class:`finesse.components.lens.AstigmaticLens` element added with x and y focal
  length parameters. Works the same as a :class:`finesse.components.lens.Lens` and also
  has an OPD map attribute.
- Added simple sinusoidal and Helical LG mode calculation functions to
  :mod:`finesse.cymath.laguerre` module, see :ref:`example <hom_laguerre>`
- Added developer documentation :ref:`page <code_overview>` on the internal matrix
  solver.
- Added ``reverse_gouy`` and ``flip_lr`` options to
  :meth:`finesse.knm.maps.Map.scatter_matrix` to allow for more flexibility in how the
  scatter matrix is computed.

Fixed
=====

- Fixed #685: Figure dictionary return by ``solution.plot()`` method has correct strings
  keys when single detector is present.
- Fixed #669: :meth:`finesse.knm.maps.Map.remove_piston` accepts spot_size only with
  type ``float`` and not ``np.float``
- Fixed #666: :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.dc.DCFieldsSolutions` and
  :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.lti.FrequencyResponseSolution` cannot select
  themselves by name
- Fixed #573: Symbolic changing division in lens focal length makes cavity
  unstable
- Fixed a collection of warnings in various tests

Changed
=======

- Drop support for Python 3.9 due to various packages no longer supporting it
- Allows a superclass of :class:`finesse.knm.maps.Map` to be used as a base class for
  custom maps. This allows for more flexibility in defining custom maps that define
  their own aperture and surface functions. The following example demonstrates:

.. code:: ipython3

   class CustomMap(Map):
      def __init__(self):
         x = ...
         y = ...
         super().__init__(
            self,
            x,
            y,
            opd=self.surface,
            amplitude=self.aperture,
         )

      def aperture(self, model=None):
         return ...

      def surface(self, model=None):
         return ...

- :class:`finesse.exceptions.NotChangeableDuringSimulation` now raised when trying to
  change a parameter that is not changeable during a simulation. This also fixes a bug
  where these changes are circumvented by using symbolics. Parameters that are not
  changeable during a simulation are flagged because some internal logic has not been
  implement yet to handle these changes.

****************************************************************
`3.0a29 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a29/>`_ (2024-11-14)
****************************************************************

Fixed
=====

- Fixed a critical bug in :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.dc.DCFields` where the fields
  were not always recalculated after parameter changes.
- Fixed broken :class:`finesse.components.isolator.Isolator` component, which caused a13
  segfault in included in a model that was being run.

Added
=====

- Added a new utility function :func:`finesse.utilities.bug_report.bug_report` to make
  it easier to report issues by automatically collecting relevant information. See
  :ref:`reporting_issues` for an example.
- Added a ``show`` and ``path`` argument to :meth:`finesse.model.Model.plot_graph` to
  control whether to show the plot and whether to save it to disk.

Changed
=======

-  Use a more numerically stable method for calculating the frequency response of zpk
   filters which is more robust with filters with a large number of roots.
-  FieldDetectors now work with planewave models and no longer throw a warning.

****************************************************************
`3.0a28 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a28/>`_ (2024-09-19)
****************************************************************

This release includes two changes to default way of handling phases in |Finesse|,
which are listed below. The effect of these changes is subtle, and described in
detail in :ref:`phase_configurations` and :ref:`beamsplitter_phase`.

.. warning::

   If your simulations produce different results after updating to this release, it is
   likely that your previous results were incorrect, since the old default can break
   power conservation in certain setups.

You can switch between the two settings using :meth:`finesse.model.Model.phase_config`

.. code:: ipython3

   # new default
   model.phase_config(False, True)
   # old default
   model.phase_config(True, True)

You can use this to check if your results are impacted by this change.

The changes have been tested with both the finesse-ligo_ and finesse-virgo_ packages,
so if you are using these you will probably not be affected.

If you have any questions, do not hestitate to contact us via the `matrix channel
<https://matrix.to/#/#finesse:matrix.org>`_.

.. _finesse-ligo: https://finesse.docs.ligo.org/finesse-ligo/index.html
.. _finesse-virgo: https://git.ligo.org/finesse/finesse-virgo


Breaking Changes
================

-  The default value for ``zero_k00`` :meth:`finesse.model.Model.phase_config` has been
   changed to ``False``. See :ref:`phase_configurations` for more information and an
   example of how the old default can break power conservation in the simulation Any
   simulation running with higher order modes and a cavity could be affected by this
   change and users using :class:`finesse.knm.maps.Map` should make sure they use
   optimizers for locking.

-  The phase relationship on transmission has been changed to a new default. It will be
   identical to the previous relationship for most cases, but will prevent power
   conservation issues in more complicated setups. You can set the
   ``_settings.phase_config.v2_transmission_phase`` to ``True`` if you want to revert
   to the old (Finesse 2) behavior, but the new behavior is likely more physically
   correct. See :ref:`beamsplitter_phase` for more details.


Added
=====

-  Add missing docs for many katscript :ref:`analyses` and :ref:`elements` (incl. new
   group Mechanical Elements), fix many broken links
-  Extra documentation on :ref:`phase_configurations`
-  New method: :meth:`finesse.model.Model.get_open_ports`
-  New class :class:`finesse.utilities.collections.OrderedSet`, used in multiple places
   where ordering of results/components is relevant
-  Distance-based filtering for visualizing subgraphs of the model graph, see :ref:`model_visualization`

Changed
=======


-  :meth:`finesse.model.Model.get_elements_of_type` now returns a tuple instead of a
   generator, and accepts element names as strings as well as python classes as
   arguments:

-  Added an option ``full_output`` to :func:`finesse.gaussian.optimise_HG00_q_scipy` to
   return the optimized array of HG modes alongside the fit result. This replaces the
   previous ``return_fit_result`` argument.

-  Include parity flip on reflection in Mirror and Beamsplitter ABCD methods. See also
   the new ``_s`` and ``_t`` suffixes in methods in :mod:`finesse.tracing.abcd` and the
   :issue:`123`. For backward compatible code, use something like:

.. code:: ipython3

   try:
      from finesse.tracing.abcd import space, beamsplitter_refl

      beamsplitter_refl_t = lambda *args: beamsplitter_refl(*args, "x")
      beamsplitter_refl_s = lambda *args: beamsplitter_refl(*args, "y")
   except ImportError:
      # Handle newer versions which separate the beamsplitter refl # into the tangential
      and sagittal planes from 3.0a28 from finesse.tracing.abcd import (
         space, beamsplitter_refl_s, beamsplitter_refl_t,
      )

-  Changes the examples in the documentation to indicate that parsing an action in
   KatScript and calling ``model.run()`` without any arguments is not recommended.

Removed
=======

-  The ``'sagittal'`` and ``'tangential'`` synonyms for ``'y'`` and ``'x'`` for the
   :kat:command:`modes` command have been removed, since they can cause confusion with
   the new ``plane`` option for :class:`finesse.components.beamsplitter.Beamsplitter`
   and :class:`finesse.components.mirror.Mirror`

Fixed
=====

-  Single solution outputs can be seleceted by their name now, so you do not need to add
   extra actions or put them in series unnecessarily.
-  Clarified the docstrings for the :class:`finesse.components.cavity.Cavity` class its
   :meth:`finesse.components.cavity.Cavity.path` method.
-  The shape of DCFieldsSolution is reverted to ``[nodes, frequencies, HOMs]``, as
   described in :class:`finesse.analysis.actions.dc.DCFieldsSolutions`
-  When removing a :ref:`readouts` component, remove the associated output detectors as
   well (note that removing components from a model is unreliable in general)
-  Parameters of autogenerated spaces and wires not generating a correct ``full_name``
   attribute.
-  Fixed issue :issue:`659` - missing ``sol = model.run()`` in documentation for Maximise
   action

****************************************************************
`3.0a17 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a17/>`_ (2023-08-02)
****************************************************************

-  Fixing block diagram generation for signal paths

****************************************************************
`3.0a15 <https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/3.0a15/>`_ (2023-07-24)
****************************************************************

Adding additional features for degrees of freedom to allow for better/easier modelling
