## Complete Transcript

**Sarah Abo (Anchor)**: Denmark's Foreign Minister says it's totally unacceptable not to respect Greenland's territory. that's after he met with Vice President JD Vance for talks in Washington D.C. Let's go live to US correspondent Jonathan Kearsley in Los Angeles. Jono, President Trump is adamant Greenland should be in the hands of the United States.

**Jonathan Kearsley (Reporter)**: This is a position he's held for some time, Ally, and he's certainly ramped up his rhetoric over the last couple of weeks. This morning, at the Executive Office Building across the road from the White House, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. Essentially it was a date with Greenland's destiny if you like. But the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland seem to walk away fairly pleased with how things went, at least on their side. Essentially saying that they have agreed to disagree with the United States. Donald Trump wants Greenland in US possession, and there is a reported price tag on that of around about one trillion Australian dollars. But we've heard from Denmark saying that essentially they are willing to bolster their own military presence on the ice island, so too were European allies. The concern is Russia and Greenland [China] has been hanging around that area and it is of extreme importance, that is Greenland is, to the national security of the United States, but also Europe as a whole. There is the President now inside the Oval Office as we wait for him to comment on this meeting and what he believes could be Greenland's future. But this is what the Denmark Foreign Minister had to say a short time ago.

**Lars Løkke Rasmussen (Danish FM)**: The President has made his view clear. And we have a different position. We, the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to believe that also the long-term security of Greenland can be insured inside the current framework.

**Jonathan Kearsley**: That current framework essentially means NATO and likely could mean an increased military presence. President Trump did post to Truth Social earlier today when it comes to NATO saying "NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States of America." Ally.

**Sarah Abo**: Jono, thank you.

**Karl Stefanovic (Anchor)**: Well, Donald Trump is this morning doubling down on his threat to seize control of Greenland.

**Sarah Abo**: Now Denmark says it will increase the military presence in and around the Arctic territory starting today.

**Karl Stefanovic**: Joining us to discuss is former White House advisor Laura Schwartz in Maui. Laura, good morning. What do we know about this expanded military presence and—let's be real—what could they actually do to deter the massive U.S. military?

**Laura Schwartz (Guest)**: Well good morning. That's a great question to kick it off. We just heard the meeting wrapped up about an hour ago, the Foreign Minister of Denmark and of Greenland met with Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State. Somewhat of a surprise guest announced just a couple days ago was also JD Vance, who has been very critical of Greenland, very critical of Denmark, very critical of NATO. In fact, he went to Greenland just under a year ago to show the U.S. strength. So with that in mind, Denmark and Greenland came here today to say, listen, we need to normalize our relationship. Let's see what we can do to take our cooperation to another level before the military is involved, before you try to buy us. And they just came out and did a brief press conference. The Foreign Minister of Denmark said the meeting was 'frank and constructive' which is sort of diplomatic speak for 'contentious' to say the least. But he did say that, you know, Denmark has always had more than just dog sleds—which is sort of a hit Trump tries to make on Greenland. He said we're way beyond dog sleds. We have fighter jets. We have ships. Those have been deployed. Sweden has also upped what they're doing in the country militarily, and France by the way is opening a consulate in just a couple of weeks in Greenland. Because Denmark noted: we are part of NATO. Which means we are protected under the Article 5 provision that if we are invaded as a sovereign nation, NATO will respond. So with that in mind, Denmark said that they left it saying 'let's get a higher level working group together, let's address one: the security concerns that America has, and two: respect the red line that Denmark and Greenland have.' Because America doesn't have to buy it or invade it because under a 1951 compact they can add in more military installations...

**Sarah Abo**: (Interrupting) But I just wonder, Laura... where can they get with these talks when you've already heard the US President saying that anything less than US control of Greenland is unacceptable? I mean he's got the red line, right there.

**Laura Schwartz**: Well, you know, Trump is great at saber rattling. He ratchets it up to a 10, maybe they land around an 8. I think with the right access to rare earth minerals given to America, which Donald Trump really wants. From graphite to the other minerals that are present there. As well as extending, perhaps creating a joint operational base of America and Denmark, or an American/NATO base. to say we will put our military back there, because we used to even have more bases in Greenland than we have now. We have a Space Command there. So ramp that up and kind of take the win that "now he mobilized all of NATO to put more military assets there." So there may be ways to cajole Trump. This is just the start. And by the way, the foreign ministers are on their way up to the Hill right now to meet with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. And there is a Congressional Delegation going this weekend—bipartisan—because this isn't something that the Hill is really up for. I mean Trump's emboldened right now. He just took Venezuela and he wants Greenland to be next.

**Karl Stefanovic**: Yeah, extraordinary, extraordinary times we live in where you've got militaries of the US and Europe posturing.

**Sarah Abo**: Absolutely. Laura, thank you so much for your insight this morning.
