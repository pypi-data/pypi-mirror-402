IMAPClient is an easy-to-use, Pythonic and complete IMAP client library.

Features:
    * Arguments and return values are natural Python types.
    * IMAP server responses are fully parsed and readily usable.
    * IMAP unique message IDs (UIDs) are handled transparently.
    * Internationalised mailbox names are transparently handled.
    * Time zones are correctly handled.
    * Convenience methods are provided for commonly used functionality.
    * Exceptions are raised when errors occur.

Python versions 3.8 through 3.13 are officially supported.

IMAPClient includes comprehensive units tests and automated
functional tests that can be run against a live IMAP server.
