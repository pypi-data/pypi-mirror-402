# 1. Version Handling
# We try to import the version generated by setuptools_scm.
# If the package isn't installed/built yet, we fallback to a default.

# 2. Namespace Flattening
# Import main classes/functions from your source scripts so they are available
# directly at the package level.
# Replace 'MyMainClass' and 'my_utility_function' with the ACTUAL names
# inside your source_scripts.py file.

# This controls what happens if someone does 'from github_repo_name import *'
