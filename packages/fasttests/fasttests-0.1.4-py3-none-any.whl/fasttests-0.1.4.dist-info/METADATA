# Fasttests

Sometimes creating an automated test structure and thinking through architectural decisions takes more time than writing the test itself. If you, like me, have encountered this thought, then this library is for you.

Currently, the library provides templates for creating automated test architecture, which allows you to focus on the logic of the test itself.
