class SyncBatch:
    """Class that's used to synchronously run a batch of tasks on the
    Minecraft server

    This class shouldn't be created directly. Use
    :meth:`SyncClient.batch`.

    This class is thread-safe.

    The batch works by creating a single *action* and sending it to the
    Minecraft server to be processed. Each method in this class adds a
    *payload* (which represents a single task) to the action.

    This class provides the same basic functionality as the methods that
    are available directly in :class:`SyncClient`, but using a batch
    causes the payloads to be submitted to the computer in a single
    network call (as a single action). This ensures that the timing
    between the payloads is consistent, which makes time-sensitive
    tasks such as interacting with redstone more reliable.

    This class must be used as a context manager. For example::

        with client.batch(wait=True) as batch:
            batch.redstone.set_output(cc.BlockSide.RIGHT, 15)
            batch.sleep(20)
            batch.redstone.set_output(cc.BlockSide.RIGHT, 0)

    The action containing all the payloads will be sent to the Minecraft
    server when the context manager exits. The payloads will run on the
    server in sequential order. If any of the payloads fail, the
    remaining payloads won't be run.

    If ``wait`` is ``True``, the context manager will block until the
    action finishes (all payloads have finished). If any of the payloads
    fail, the exception will be raised by the context manager.

    If ``wait`` is ``False``, the context manager will not wait for the
    action to complete before exiting. In this case, you can retrieve
    the results of the payloads in real time. For example::

        with client.batch(wait=False) as batch:
            future1 = batch.sensor.get_location()
            future2 = batch.sleep(20)
            future3 = batch.redstone.get_inputs()

        for future in (future1, future2, future3):
            result = future.result()
            print("Got result:", result)

    If any of the payloads fail, the exception will be raised by the
    future.

    For highly-concurrent programs, consider using
    :class:`clustercomputers.AsyncClient` instead of just setting
    ``wait`` to ``False``.
