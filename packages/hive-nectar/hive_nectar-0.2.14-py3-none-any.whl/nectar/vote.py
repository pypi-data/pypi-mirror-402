        Supports multiple input shapes for `voter`:
        - voter as str with `authorperm` provided: `voter` is the voter name; `authorperm` is parsed into author/permlink.
        - voter as dict containing "author", "permlink", and "voter": uses those fields directly.
        - voter as dict with "authorperm" plus an external `authorperm` argument: resolves author/permlink and fills missing fields.
