# nectar - Python Library for HIVE

nectar is a python library for HIVE, which is
created from the remains of [beem](https://github.com/holgern/beem) which was derived from [python-bitshares](https://github.com/xeroc/python-bitshares)
The library name is derived from a nectar of a flower.

nectar includes [python-graphenelib](https://github.com/xeroc/python-graphenelib).

## Current build status

# Support & Documentation

You may find help in the nectar-discord. The discord channel can also be used to discuss things about nectar.

A complete library documentation is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://hive-nectar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# RPC surface

- Single appbase JSON-RPC path: all calls use the `api.method` shape with defaults from the static `src/nectarapi/openapi.py` map (no condenser/appbase flag or bundled JSON specs).
- Transport: pooled `httpx` client with retry/backoff handled by the RPC layer and shared across the module-level `shared_blockchain_instance()` helper.
- Shared instance: constructing `Hive(...)` will reuse the shared transport once initialized; `set_shared_blockchain_instance`/`shared_blockchain_instance` expose a singleton when you want one process-wide instance.

# Installation

The minimal working Python version is >=3.10

nectar can be installed parallel to beem.

For Debian and Ubuntu, please ensure that the following packages are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools
```

The following package speeds up hive-nectar:

> sudo apt-get install python3-gmpy2

For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, please ensure that the following
packages are installed:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel python-devel
```

For OSX, please do the following:

    brew install openssl
    export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include $CFLAGS"
    export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib $LDFLAGS"

For Termux on Android, please install the following packages:

```bash
pkg install clang openssl python
```

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography (you
may need to replace pip3 by pip):

```bash
pip3 install -U cryptography
```

or (you may need to replace pip3 by pip):

```bash
pip3 install -U secp256k1prp
```

Install or update nectar by pip(you may need to replace pip3 by pip):

```bash
pip3 install -U hive-nectar
```

You can install nectar from this repository if you want the latest but
possibly non-compiling version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecrazygm/hive-nectar.git
cd hive-nectar
uv sync
uv sync --dev
```

Run tests after install:

```bash
pytest
```

## Ledger support

For Ledger (Nano S) signing, the following package must be installed:
