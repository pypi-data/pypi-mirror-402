## 🔄 Report Generation

Reports are automatically generated during every CI/CD pipeline run:

- **Trigger Events**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, manual workflow dispatch
- **Generation Process**:
  1. CI pipeline runs tests, coverage analysis, and security scans
  2. Artifacts are collected from all pipeline jobs
  3. `tools/generate_reports.py` processes artifacts into markdown
  4. Reports are deployed to GitHub Pages with updated timestamps
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time (on every commit to main branch)
- **Timestamp Format**: Each report includes generation timestamp at bottom
- **Retention**: Latest reports in documentation site, historical data in CI artifacts

## 📈 Key Metrics

## 🎯 Quality Standards

Our CI/CD pipeline enforces these quality gates:

- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Minimum 85% code coverage
- ✅ No critical/high security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Type checking passes in strict mode
- ✅ Code formatting compliant (Ruff)
- ✅ All licenses compatible with MIT
- ✅ Load tests complete with <1% failure rate

## 🔍 Viewing Reports

### Latest Reports
Latest reports are available in this documentation site and updated automatically on every deployment to the main branch.

### Historical Reports
Historical reports are available as CI/CD artifacts:

1. Navigate to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/yourusername/msn-weather-wrapper/actions)
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download artifacts from the "Artifacts" section

### Local Generation
To generate reports locally:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src/msn_weather_wrapper --cov-report=html

# Run security scans
bandit -r src/ -f txt
safety check
pip-audit

# Generate license report
pip-licenses --format=markdown
```
