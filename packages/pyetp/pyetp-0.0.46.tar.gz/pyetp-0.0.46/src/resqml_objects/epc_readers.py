    """This function is fairly brute-force; the function reads all files in the
    provided EPC-file, and tries to parse it as one of the auto-generated
    RESQML v2.0.1 objects. If you are unsure that all objects were included you
    should set `log_failed_objects=True` and see if there are any missed
    RESQML-objects. Objects such as `[Content_Types].xml`, `docProps/core.xml`,
    and anything under the `_rels/`-directory are not RESQML-objects, and will
    be logged as failed.


    Parameters
    ----------
    epc_filename: str | pathlib.Path
        The name of the EPC-file. Typically with an `.epc`-extension.
    log_failed_objects: bool
        Set to `True` in order to log the objects that were not parsed as
        RESQML v2.0.1 objects along with their errors. Default is `False`.


    Returns
    -------
    list[ro_201.AbstractObject]
        A list of the parsed RESQML v2.0.1 objects.

    connected array data.


    Parameters
    ----------
    epc_hdf_filename: str | pathlib.Path
        The filename of the HDF5-file that is connected to an EPC-file. This is
        typically the same filename as the EPC-file, but with the
