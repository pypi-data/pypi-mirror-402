
# Because I don't remember there is the '|' in Python3.10+
# So I do it to make the mistake right

# a lightweight package
## There are many module on it
such as algo, algebra, const, rgb... You name it!
A simple:
```python
from unstdlibpy.algebra import *
num = X * X
# algebra(use json to store algebra, light weight but slow)
# If you are interested in it, you can make a better function than Algebra.simplify(self).

print(num)
# look at num, presented in the form of plain text.
# It's still the same feeling.
# If you are interested in it, you also can make a better function than Algebra.__str__(self).
# Although you make a new library to do it, I don't care. But you have to make it free. FREE!

print(num.getvalue(2, X)) # Get a value of num(square of X).
```
# over
That's the all. If you're interestd in this module, please make more people know it!
