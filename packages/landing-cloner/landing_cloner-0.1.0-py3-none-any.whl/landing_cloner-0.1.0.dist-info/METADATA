# landing_cloner

🚀 **Clone any one-page website and instantly turn it into a Flask app.**

`landing_cloner` lets you take a landing page (from a constructor or any public URL), clone it into a **self-hosted Flask project**, and fully control it — no platform limits, no traffic restrictions, no vendor lock-in.

Perfect for marketers, indie hackers, and developers who want **ownership** over their landing pages.
