                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# stochastix
*Differentiable, hardware accelerated stochastic kinetic models in JAX.*

</div>



The main purpose of this library is to provide a high-level, fairly flexible implementation of stochastic simulations of kinetic models (also commonly referred to as *Gillespie simulations* from the author of the most used solvers).

The design is heavily inspired by the [Diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) library for solution of differential equations and heavily relies on the infrastructure provided by [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox). All of this is built on top of [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), if you are new to this world you might want to take a quick look at some basic [JAX Tutorials](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/tutorials.html).

Basic usage of the main `stochastix` API for running forward simulations should require only a minimal knowledge of JAX.

**Main features:**

- Automatic GPU/TPU acceleration, JIT compilation, and vectorization via JAX
- Exact, approximate, and pathwise differentiable stochastic solvers (`DirectMethod`, `TauLeaping`, `DifferentiableDirect`, `DGA`, etc.)
- Seamless integration with the JAX ecosystem (Equinox, Diffrax, Optax, etc.)
- Automatic conversion between CME (jump process), CLE (stochastic differential equation), and ODE (deterministic differential equation) models for Diffrax integration
- Built-in kinetics (MassAction, Hill, Michaelis–Menten) and support for learnable neural network propensities
- Controllers for time-based interventions during simulations
- Likelihood computation via `log_prob` for exact trajectories and helpers for REINFORCE-style training
- Analysis utilities: differentiable autocorrelation, cross-correlation, histograms, and mutual information


## Installation

### GPU support

`stochastix` (as all other JAX-based libraries) relies on JAX for hardware acceleration support. To run on GPU or other accelerators, you need to install the appropriate JAX version. If JAX is not already present, the standard `stochastix` installation will automatically install the CPU version.


Please refer to the [JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for the latest guidelines.


### pip

To install the package and core dependencies:

```bash
pip install stochastix
```

or directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fmottes/stochastix.git
```

**Note:** in order to run the Jupyter notebooks, you need to install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install stochastix[notebooks]
```

### uv

You can add the package to your project dependencies with:

```bash
uv add stochastix
```

For all other `uv` installation options, see the [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).



## Quick Example

A basic simulation of a chain reaction with Gillespie's direct method:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

import stochastix as stx
from stochastix.kinetics import MassAction

# simple reaction chain with mass action rates
network = stx.ReactionNetwork([
    stx.Reaction("0 -> X", MassAction(k=0.01)),
    stx.Reaction("X -> Y", MassAction(k=0.002))
])


x0 = jnp.array([0, 0])  # initial conditions [X, Y]
sim_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)  # key for jax random number generator

# solve with direct method from t0=0 to t1=100
sim_results = stx.stochsimsolve(sim_key, network, x0, T=100.0)
```
