    A wrapper that measures the wall-clock time between the last observation (step/reset)
    and the current action (step), and deducts that duration from the agent's clock.

    This enforces "Real-Time" constraints on the agent. If the agent takes 10 seconds
    to compute an action, 10 seconds will be subtracted from its game clock in the environment.

    Without this wrapper, the environment assumes 0.0s elapsed time for the agent's move
    unless manually provided in the step() tuple.
