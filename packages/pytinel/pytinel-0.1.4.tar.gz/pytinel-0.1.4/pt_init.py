FIRST_RUN_DISCLAIMER = """Welcome to Pytinel

Pytinel (Python Terminal in Natural Executable Language) is an intelligent standalone application that mimics a REPL interface. It interprets natural-language prompts and executes the corresponding Python code directly in your runtime environment—with no display of intermediate code generation.

Execution Model:
- Generated code runs silently by default.
- High-risk operations (including but not limited to file system modifications, network requests, subprocess invocations, and environment variable changes) require explicit user authorization before execution.

Credential Management:
- LLM API credentials are stored locally using platform-adaptive key derivation and AES-based at-rest encryption.
- No credentials, prompts, generated code, or execution results are transmitted off-device. Pytinel collects no telemetry, logs no session data, and conducts no external communication whatsoever.

Security Notice:
- Code generated by large language models may contain logical errors, security vulnerabilities, or unintended side effects.
- Pytinel implements prompt-level risk filtering but does not perform static or dynamic analysis of generated code.
- By using this tool, you accept full responsibility for the safety, correctness, and consequences of all executed instructions.
