**hurdat2py** is a research-focused Python interface for the NOAA HURDAT2 Dataset. It automates data retrieval and parsing, giving you immediate access to clean, analysis-ready data.
* Note: Currently only the North Atlantic Basin is supported. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more info.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hurdat2py
```
## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the Database
* You can specify a path to a local download of the Hurdat2 dataset.
```python
import hurdat2py

hd2 = hurdat2py.Hurdat2("path_to_file.txt")
```
* If no path is specified, it will automatically download the latest data from [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/) (~7MB) and save it locally.
    * Note: The cached file will be overwritten after 30 days to ensure the latest file is available.

```python
import hurdat2py

hd2 = hurdat2py.Hurdat2()
```

### 2. Create `Storm` or `Season` objects
* Allows for easy access to storm or season data.
```python
# Storm obect:
storm = hd2['bob', 1991]
# or
storm = hd2['al031991']

# Season object:
season = hd2[1991]
```
* See [The Storm Object](#2-the-storm-object) or [The Season Object](#3-the-season-object) for more info.

## API Reference
### 1. The Database (Hurdat2)
The main entry point. Handles downloading, caching, and parsing the raw text data.

Method | Description | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`hurdat2py.Hurdat2()` | Initializes the database. Downloads latest data if local cache is missing/expired. | `hd2 = hurdat2py.Hurdat2()`
`db['name', year]`| **Get Storm (by Name)***. Returns a `Storm` object. Case-insensitive. <br> <br> *This method will not work for storms named UNNAMED, especially before 1950. | `storm = hd2['bob', 1991]`
`db[atcfid]` | **Get Storm (by ID)**. Returns a `Storm` object using ATCFID. | `storm = hd2['al031991']`
`db[year]` | **Get Season**. Returns a `Season` object for the specified year. | `season = hd2[1991]`
`rank_seasons_by_ace()` | Returns a sorted list of seasons by Accumulated Cyclone Energy (`float`). | `top5 = hd2.rank_seasons_by_ace()[:5]` 

### 2. The `Storm` Object
Represents a single tropical cyclone.

Method/Attribute | Description | Example
 :--- | :--- | :--- 
`name` | Operational name (e.g., "Bob") (`str`). | `print(storm.name)`
`atcfid` | ATCF ID (e.g., "AL031991") (`str`). | `print(storm.atcfid)`
`year` | The year the storm formed (`int`). | `print(storm.year)`
`ace` | Accumulated Cyclone Energy (10^-4 kn^2) (`float`). | `print(storm.ace)`
`peak_wind` | Maximum sustained wind speed (knots) (`int`). | `print(storm.peak_wind)`
`peak_status` | Highest tropical classification the storm achieved (MH, HU, TS, SS, TD, SD) (`str`). | `print(storm.peak_status)`
`min_pressure` | Minimum central pressure (mb) (`int`). | `print(storm.min_pressure)`
`landfalls` | Number of landfalls recorded* (`int`). <br> <br>*Note: not every landfall is recorded in the Hurdat2 dataset. | `print(storm.landfalls)`
`lats`/`lons` | Raw list of latitude/longitude points. | `ax.plot(storm.lons, storm.lats)`
`duration_total` <br> `duration_tc` <br> `duration_ts` <br> `duration_hurricane` <br> `duration_major` | Duration of the system in hours, while at specified status (`float`) | `print(storm.duration_tc)`
`distance_total` <br> `distance_tc` <br> `distance_ts`  <br> `distance_hurricane` <br> `distance_major` | Distance* the system travelled in Nautical Miles, while at specified status (`float`)  <br>  <br> *Note: Distances calculated using the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula). | `print(storm.distance_major)`
`info()` | Prints quick overview of the storm. | `storm.info()`
`stats()` | Prints statistics and detailed information about the storm. | `storm.stats()`
`plot()` | Plots storm track, colored by Saffir-Simpson intensity. Plot aesthetic is inspired by the tropycal package. | `storm.plot()`
`plot_intensity()` | Plots the storm's windspeed over time, colored by Saffir-Simpson intensity. <br> Kwargs: <br> zoom (`bool`) Crops into the intensity curve. <br> landfalls (`bool`) Plots landfall times on intensity curve. | storm.plot_intensity(zoom=True, landfalls=False)
`to_dataframe()` | Exports track data (date, time, lat, lon, wind, pressure) to a Pandas DataFrame. | `df = storm.to_dataframe()`

### 3. The `Season` Object
Represents a full year of activity.

Method/Attribute | Description | Example
 :--- | :--- | :--- 
`year` | Returns the year of the season (`int`) | `print(season.year)`
`storms` | List of `Storm` objects within the season. | `print(season.storms)`
`total_storms` | Number of storms in the season (`int`). Effectively `len(season.storms)` | `print(season_total_storms)`
`tropical_storms` | Number of tropical storms in the season (`int`). | `print(season.tropical_storms)`
`hurricanes` | Number of hurricanes in the season (`int`). | `print(season.hurricanes)`
`major_hurricanes` | Number of major hurricanes in the season (`int`). | `print(season.major_hurricanes)`
`ace` | Total Accumulated Cyclone Energy for the season (`float`). | `print(season.ace)`
`stats()` | Prints statistics and detailed information about the season. | `season.stats()`
`plot()` | Plots all storm tracks for the season, colored by Saffir-Simpson intensity. Plot aesthetic is inspired by the tropycal package.  <br> Kwargs: <br> labels (`bool`) Adds labels for each storm track. | `season.plot(labels=True)`
`to_dataframe()` | Exports track data (date, time, lat, lon, wind, pressure) for all storms in the season to a Pandas DataFrame. | `df = season.to_dataframe()`

### Acknowledgements
* **Inspiration**: This work was inspired by the great [hurdat2parser](https://pypi.org/project/hurdat2parser/) package. There are many technical capabilities of hurdat2parser that we do not seek to replicate. We recommend you choose whichever package best suites your needs.

* **Plotting Style**: The map visualization aesthetic in this package was inspired by the excellent [tropycal](https://tropycal.github.io/tropycal/index.html) package. While `hurdat2py` is a standalone implementation, we aimed to match their clear, publication-ready visual style.
