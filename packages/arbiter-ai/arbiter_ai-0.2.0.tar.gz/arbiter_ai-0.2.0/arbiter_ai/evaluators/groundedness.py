"""Groundedness evaluator for validating RAG system outputs.

This evaluator assesses whether LLM outputs are properly grounded in source
documents by identifying statements and verifying they can be attributed to
provided sources. It's essential for RAG systems to prevent hallucinations
and ensure outputs are based on retrieved context.

## When to Use:

- Validating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) outputs
- Ensuring AI responses are grounded in provided sources
- Detecting hallucinations in context-based generation
- Verifying citation accuracy and source attribution
- Quality assurance for document-based question answering

## Example:

    >>> evaluator = GroundednessEvaluator(llm_client)
    >>> score = await evaluator.evaluate(
    ...     output="Paris is the capital of France with population of 2.2M",
    ...     reference="Paris, the capital city of France, has a population of 2.16 million"
    ... )
    >>> print(f"Groundedness score: {score.value:.2f}")
    >>> print(f"Ungrounded: {score.metadata.get('ungrounded_statements', [])}")
    Groundedness score: 0.5
    Ungrounded statements: ['Paris has population of 2.2M']

    This evaluator validates RAG system outputs by checking if statements
    can be attributed to provided source documents. It identifies grounded

    The evaluator:
    - Extracts statements from the output
    - Maps each statement to supporting source text (if available)
    - Categorizes statements as grounded or ungrounded
    - Provides a score based on the ratio of grounded to total statements
    - Returns detailed citation mappings for transparency

    Modes:
    - With reference: Verify all statements are grounded in reference sources
    - With criteria: Focus on specific types of statements (facts, claims, etc.)

Your task is to evaluate whether LLM outputs are properly grounded in source documents by:

1. EXTRACTING STATEMENTS: Identify all factual statements and claims in the output
2. VERIFYING SOURCES: Check if each statement can be attributed to the provided sources
3. CATEGORIZING STATEMENTS:
   - Grounded: Statements directly supported by source text (can cite specific source)
   - Ungrounded: Statements not supported by sources, contradicting sources, or hallucinated

4. CITATION MAPPING: For grounded statements, identify the specific source text that supports them

5. SCORING: Calculate groundedness score based on the ratio:
   score = grounded_statements / total_statements
   - All statements grounded = score 1.0
   - No statements grounded = score 0.0
   - Partial groundedness = proportional score

Important Guidelines:
- Be strict: A statement is only "grounded" if clearly supported by source text
- Exact match not required: Paraphrasing is acceptable if meaning is preserved
- Detect hallucinations: Flag any statements not supported by sources
- No inference: Don't mark statements as grounded if they require inferential leaps
- Track citations: Map each grounded statement to its supporting source passage
- Handle contradictions: Statements contradicting sources are ungrounded
- Partial support: If only part of a statement is grounded, mark as ungrounded

Provide:
- A groundedness score from 0.0 (completely ungrounded) to 1.0 (fully grounded)
- Your confidence in this assessment
- Clear categorization of each statement
- Citation mapping for grounded statements
- Detailed explanation of your reasoning"""
