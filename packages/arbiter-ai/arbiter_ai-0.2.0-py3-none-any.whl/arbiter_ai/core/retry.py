"""Retry logic for handling transient failures in LLM API calls.

This module provides a configurable retry system for handling temporary
failures when calling LLM APIs. It implements exponential backoff and
selective retry based on error types.

## Key Features:

- **Exponential Backoff**: Delays increase between retries to avoid
  overwhelming APIs
- **Selective Retry**: Only retries specific error types that are likely
  to be transient
- **Configurable Limits**: Control max attempts, delays, and backoff rates
- **Preset Configurations**: Quick, Standard, and Persistent retry strategies
- **Jitter**: Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Max Delay**: Limit maximum delay between retries

## Usage:

    >>> # Use default retry
    >>> @with_retry()
    >>> async def call_api():
    ...     return await llm_client.generate(prompt)

    >>> # Use custom configuration
    >>> config = RetryConfig(max_attempts=5, delay=2.0)
    >>> @with_retry(config)
    >>> async def reliable_call():
    ...     return await critical_operation()

    >>> # Use preset configuration
    >>> @with_retry(RETRY_PERSISTENT)
    >>> async def important_call():
    ...     return await slow_api()

## Error Handling:

The retry system only retries these error types:
- ModelProviderError: API errors from LLM providers
- TimeoutError: Request timeouts
- ConnectionError: Network connectivity issues

Other errors are raised immediately without retry.

class RetryConfig:
    """Configuration for retry behavior with exponential backoff.

    This class defines how retry logic should behave when operations fail.
    It controls the number of attempts, delays between attempts, and how
    delays increase over time. It also supports jitter to prevent thundering
    herd and a maximum delay to limit the total time spent on retries.

    The retry delay follows this pattern:
    - 1st retry: delay seconds
    - 2nd retry: delay * backoff seconds
    - 3rd retry: delay * backoff^2 seconds
    - And so on...

    Example:
        >>> # Quick retries for fast operations
        >>> quick = RetryConfig(max_attempts=2, delay=0.5, backoff=1.5)
        >>>
        >>> # Patient retries for slow APIs
        >>> patient = RetryConfig(max_attempts=5, delay=2.0, backoff=2.0)
        >>>
        >>> # Custom configuration
        >>> custom = RetryConfig(
        ...     max_attempts=4,
        ...     delay=1.0,      # Start with 1 second
        ...     backoff=3.0     # Triple the delay each time
        ... )

    Attributes:
        max_attempts: Maximum number of attempts before giving up (must be >= 1)
        delay: Initial delay in seconds between retries (must be > 0)
        backoff: Multiplier applied to delay after each retry (must be >= 1.0)
        jitter: Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd
        max_delay: Maximum delay between retries (must be > 0)

                Must be at least 1. Higher values increase reliability but
                also increase total time spent on failed operations.
            delay: Initial delay in seconds to wait before the first retry.
                Subsequent delays are multiplied by backoff. Should be based
                on typical API response times.
            backoff: Exponential backoff multiplier. Applied to delay after
                each failed attempt. Common values are 2.0 (double each time)
                or 1.5 (50% increase each time).
