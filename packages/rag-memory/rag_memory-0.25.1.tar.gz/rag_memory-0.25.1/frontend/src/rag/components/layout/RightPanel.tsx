 * RightPanel - Reserved for future use

 * Previously held DocumentViewer, but that's obsolete now.
 * Documents open in full-screen DocumentModal when clicked.

 * This panel could be repurposed for:
 * - Agent memory/context
 * - Collection quick view
 * - Recent activity
 * - etc.
 *
 * For now, it's just an empty styled container.
