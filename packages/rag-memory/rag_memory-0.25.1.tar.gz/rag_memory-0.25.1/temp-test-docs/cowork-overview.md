# Claude Code Cowork Feature Overview

## What is Cowork?

Cowork is a research preview feature that brings agentic capabilities to Claude Desktop for knowledge work beyond coding. Unlike standard conversational interactions, Cowork enables Claude to take on complex, multi-step tasks and execute them autonomously.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Direct File Access
Claude can read and write local files directly without requiring manual uploads or downloads. This streamlines workflows significantly.

### 2. Task Coordination
Complex work is automatically broken down into subtasks with parallel workstreams, allowing efficient execution of multi-faceted projects.

### 3. Professional Outputs
Cowork can create polished deliverables including:
- Excel spreadsheets with formatting and formulas
- PowerPoint presentations
- Formatted documents with proper styling

### 4. Extended Execution
Tasks can run for extended periods without conversation timeouts, making it suitable for lengthy operations.
