# RAG Memory Configuration Template
#
# This file shows the structure of config files for different environments.
# Copy this to config.dev.yaml or config.test.yaml and fill in your values.
#
# NOTE: Secrets like OPENAI_API_KEY should come from environment variables,
# not from this file. This allows config files to be safely source-controlled.

server:
  # Database connection (include credentials for local dev/test only)
  database_url: postgresql://raguser:ragpassword@localhost:54320/rag_memory

  # Neo4j connection
  neo4j_uri: bolt://localhost:7687
  neo4j_user: neo4j

  # OpenAI API key - SET VIA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, NOT HERE
  # export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

  # Graphiti entity extraction configuration (optional)
  # Number of reflexion iterations for recursive entity/relationship extraction
  # 0 = disabled (single-pass, faster, default)
  # 1-3 = recursive extraction (higher quality, slower, more expensive)
  # NOTE: Only affects ingestion (ingest_text, ingest_url, etc.), not search

  # CORS allowed origins for web frontend file uploads (optional)
  # Required for browser-based file uploads to work

mounts:
  # List of directories accessible to the MCP server (for file/directory ingestion)
  # Each mount is read-only for security
