# Coding the Future with AI - Company Vision & Strategy

## Mission Statement
Empower engineering teams and organizations to build with AI as a first-class capability, not an afterthought. We believe AI-native development is the defining skill shift of this decade.

## Core Philosophy

### The Three Pillars of AI-Native Development
1. **Intentional Design** - AI capabilities should be architected, not bolted on
2. **Principled Practice** - Systematic workflows, not ad-hoc prompting
3. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Augmentation over automation

### What Sets Us Apart
- Deep expertise in Claude and Anthropic's ecosystem
- Focus on repeatable patterns, not one-off solutions
- Teaching the "why" behind the "how"
- Practical, production-ready approaches
