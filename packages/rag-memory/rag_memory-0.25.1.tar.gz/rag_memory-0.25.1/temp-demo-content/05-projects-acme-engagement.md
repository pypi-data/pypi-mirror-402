**Sponsor**: VP of Engineering, Sarah Chen
**Budget**: $85,000

## Objectives

1. Establish AI-native development practices across 3 pilot teams
2. Build internal Claude Code primitive library (10+ primitives)
3. Train 20 developers on AI-native principles
4. Create playbook for scaling to remaining teams

## Current Status: Week 8

### Completed
- [x] Discovery and assessment (Weeks 1-2)
- [x] Principles workshop for leadership (Week 3)
- [x] Hands-on bootcamp for pilot teams (Weeks 4-5)
- [x] First primitive sprint: 6 slash commands deployed

### In Progress
- [ ] Second primitive sprint: Skills and subagents
- [ ] Documentation and playbook drafting
- [ ] Metrics dashboard setup

### Upcoming
- [ ] Scaling workshop for broader engineering org
- [ ] Executive readout and recommendations
- [ ] Handoff and support transition

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Primitive Library
| Primitive | Type | Status | Owner |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| /acme-pr-review | Slash Command | Deployed | Platform team |
| /acme-ticket | Slash Command | Deployed | Platform team |
| /acme-docs | Skill | In development | Docs team |
| security-scanner | Subagent | In development | Security team |
| test-validator | Subagent | Planned | QA team |

### 2. Training Materials
- Principles deck (delivered)
- Hands-on lab exercises (delivered)
- Video recordings of workshops (in progress)
- Self-serve learning path (planned)

### 3. Playbook Sections

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Pilot team bandwidth | Medium | High | Reduced scope for Sprint 2 |
| API cost concerns | Low | Medium | Usage monitoring dashboard |
| Security review delays | Medium | Medium | Early engagement with InfoSec |
