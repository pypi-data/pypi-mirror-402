## What is the Verbex SDK

The Verbex Python SDK is a clean, modular client for the Verbex API. It gives you a consistent interface for creating agents, configuring tools, managing calls, and more.

## Install

```bash
pip install verbex-sdk
```

## Getting an API key

1) Sign up on the Verbex Platform.
2) Open the API Keys page.
3) Click "Add new API key".
4) Name the key and click "Create".
5) Copy the key now. You will not be able to view it again.

## Quick start (create an agent)

```python
import verbex

client = verbex.Verbex(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

payload = {
    "agent_name": "Support Agent",
    "llm": {
        "llm_type": "simple",
        "model_provider": "openai",
        "model_name": "gpt-4",
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful support agent.",
        "model_temperature": 0,
    },
    "tts": {
        "provider": "elevenlabs",
        "voice_id": "voice_id",
        "voice_name": "Default",
        "model_name": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
        "voice_temperature": 0.2,
    },
    "stt": {"provider": "deepgram", "model": "nova-2-general"},
}

agent = client.ai_agents.create(payload)
```
