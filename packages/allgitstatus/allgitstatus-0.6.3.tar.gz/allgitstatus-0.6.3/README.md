## Overview
`AllGitStatus` is a [Text-based user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) (TUI) that checks the git status for all repositories found under the specified directory. It can be used to quickly understand the status of multiple repositories stored under the same common ancestor. Additionally, it can be used to pull or push changes to/from a remote when changes are detected.

### Verifying Signed Artifacts
Artifacts are signed and verified using [py-minisign](https://github.com/x13a/py-minisign) and the public key in the file `./minisign_key.pub`.

To verify that an artifact is valid, visit [the latest release](https://github.com/davidbrownell/AllGitStatus/releases/latest) and download the `.minisign` signature file that corresponds to the artifact, then run the following command, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the artifact to be verified:

```shell
uv run --with py-minisign python -c "import minisign; minisign.PublicKey.from_file('minisign_key.pub').verify_file('<filename>'); print('The file has been verified.')"
```
