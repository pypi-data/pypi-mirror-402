**WindMouse** is a Python library that generates human-like mouse movements to avoid bot detection in automation scripts. It implements the WindMouse algorithm, which creates realistic, non-linear trajectories with variable speed—mimicking natural human mouse behavior.

## Why WindMouse?

Traditional automation tools move the mouse in straight lines at constant speeds, making them easy to detect. WindMouse solves this by:

- ✨ **Generating curved, natural-looking paths** instead of straight lines
- ⚡ **Varying movement speed** dynamically throughout the trajectory
- 🎯 **Supporting multiple backends**: AutoHotkey (Windows) and PyAutoGUI (cross-platform)
- 🧩 **Offering fine-grained control** over movement physics (gravity, wind, damping)

Perfect for web scraping, game automation, UI testing, or any scenario where you need to simulate realistic human interaction.

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
pip install windmouse
```

### Modern Alternative (using `uv`)

```bash
uv add windmouse
```

### Optional Dependencies

WindMouse supports multiple backends. Choose the one that fits your needs:

**For PyAutoGUI (cross-platform):**
```bash
pip install windmouse[pyautogui]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[pyautogui]"
```

**For AutoHotkey (Windows only):**
```bash
pip install windmouse[ahk]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[ahk]"
```

**Install all backends:**
```bash
pip install windmouse[all]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[all]"
```

> **Note for Windows + AHK users**: You must have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed on your system to use the `ahk` backend.

## Quick Start

### Using PyAutoGUI (Cross-Platform)

```python
from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

# Initialize the controller
mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

# Set destination coordinates
mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

# Move the mouse using WindMouse algorithm
mouse.move_to_target(
    tick_delay=0.005,      # Small delay between steps
    step_duration=0.1      # Duration of each movement step
)
```

### Using AutoHotkey (Windows Only)

```python
from ahk import AHK
from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

# Initialize AHK and controller
ahk = AHK()
mouse = AHKMouseController(ahk)

# Set destination coordinates
mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

# Move the mouse using WindMouse algorithm
mouse.move_to_target(
    tick_delay=0.005,
    step_duration=0.1
)
```

### Advanced: Fine-Tuning the Algorithm

You can customize the physics of the mouse movement:

```python
from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
    gravity_magnitude=9,    # Strength of attraction to target (default: 9)
    wind_magnitude=3,       # Randomness/curvature of path (default: 3)
    max_step=15,            # Maximum speed (default: 15)
    damped_distance=12      # Distance where movement starts to slow (default: 12)
)

mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(1000), Coordinate(500))
mouse.move_to_target()
```

### Drag and Drop

Hold a mouse button while moving (useful for drag-and-drop operations):

```python
from windmouse import HoldMouseButton

mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(500), Coordinate(300))
mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.LEFT)
```
