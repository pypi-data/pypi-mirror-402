"""
GeomPreprocessor - Geometry preprocessor file operations

This module provides functionality for managing HEC-RAS geometry preprocessor
files. Geometry preprocessor files contain computed hydraulic properties
derived from the geometry.

All methods are static and designed to be used without instantiation.

List of Functions:
- clear_geompre_files() - Clear geometry preprocessor files for plan files

Example Usage:
    >>> from ras_commander import GeomPreprocessor, RasPlan
    >>>
    >>> # Clone a plan and geometry
    >>> new_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan("01")
    >>> new_geom_number = RasPlan.clone_geom("01")
    >>>
    >>> # Set the new geometry for the cloned plan
    >>> RasPlan.set_geom(new_plan_number, new_geom_number)
    >>> plan_path = RasPlan.get_plan_path(new_plan_number)
    >>>
    >>> # Clear geometry preprocessor files to ensure clean results
    >>> GeomPreprocessor.clear_geompre_files(plan_path)

        Clear HEC-RAS geometry preprocessor files for specified plan files.

        Geometry preprocessor files (.c* extension) contain computed hydraulic properties derived
        from the geometry. These should be cleared when the geometry changes to ensure that
        HEC-RAS recomputes all hydraulic tables with updated geometry information.

        Limitations/Future Work:
        - This function only deletes the geometry preprocessor file.
        - It does not clear the IB tables.
        - It also does not clear geometry preprocessor tables from the geometry HDF.
        - All of these features will need to be added to reliably remove geometry preprocessor
          files for 1D and 2D projects.

        Parameters:
            plan_files (Union[str, Path, List[Union[str, Path]]], optional):
                Full path(s) to the HEC-RAS plan file(s) (.p*).
                If None, clears all plan files in the project directory.
            ras_object: An optional RAS object instance.

        Returns:
            None: The function deletes files and updates the ras object's geometry dataframe

        Example:
            >>> # Clone a plan and geometry
            >>> new_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan("01")
            >>> new_geom_number = RasPlan.clone_geom("01")
            >>>
            >>> # Set the new geometry for the cloned plan
            >>> RasPlan.set_geom(new_plan_number, new_geom_number)
            >>> plan_path = RasPlan.get_plan_path(new_plan_number)
            >>>
            >>> # Clear geometry preprocessor files to ensure clean results
            >>> GeomPreprocessor.clear_geompre_files(plan_path)
            >>> print(f"Cleared geometry preprocessor files for plan {new_plan_number}")
