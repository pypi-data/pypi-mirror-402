    """
    Execute HEC-RAS plans in parallel across multiple remote workers.

    Plans are distributed to workers using naive round-robin scheduling,
    respecting each worker's queue_priority (lower values execute first).

    Args:
        plan_numbers: Single plan number or list of plan numbers to execute
        workers: List of initialized worker objects (from init_ras_worker)
        ras_object: RasPrj object for the project. If None, uses global ras.
        num_cores: Number of cores to allocate per plan execution
        clear_geompre: Clear geometry preprocessor files (.c## files) before execution
        force_geompre: Force full geometry reprocessing (clears both .g##.hdf AND .c## files)
        force_rerun: Force execution even if results are current. When False (default),
            checks file modification times and skips if results are current.
        max_concurrent: Maximum concurrent executions (default: sum of all worker slots)
        autoclean: Delete temporary worker folders after execution (default True).
                   Set to False for debugging to preserve worker folders.

    Returns:
        Dict mapping plan_number to ExecutionResult

    Example:
        # Initialize workers
        worker1 = init_ras_worker("psexec", hostname="PC1", ...)
        worker2 = init_ras_worker("psexec", hostname="PC2", ...)

        # Execute plans
        results = compute_parallel_remote(
            ["01", "02", "03", "04"],
            workers=[worker1, worker2],
            ras_object=ras
        )

        # Check results
        for plan_num, result in results.items():
            if result.success:
                print(f"Plan {plan_num}: {result.hdf_path}")
            else:
                print(f"Plan {plan_num} failed: {result.error_message}")

    Scheduling:
        Workers are sorted by queue_priority (ascending), then plans are assigned
        round-robin to available worker slots. Workers with lower queue_priority
        (e.g., 0=local, 1=remote) are filled first.

    Multi-Core Workers:
        Workers with cores_total and cores_per_plan set can run multiple plans
        in parallel. For example, a worker with cores_total=16 and cores_per_plan=4
        can run 4 plans simultaneously. Each parallel slot is called a "sub-worker".
