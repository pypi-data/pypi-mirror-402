"""
Blocked obstruction data structures and algorithms.

This module provides the core algorithm for fixing overlapping blocked obstructions
in HEC-RAS geometry files using the elevation envelope approach.

Algorithm Overview:
    1. Collect all critical stations (start/end of each obstruction)
    2. For each segment between critical stations, find max elevation
    3. Merge adjacent segments with same elevation
    4. Insert 0.02-unit gaps where different elevations meet (HEC-RAS requirement)

The algorithm is hydraulically conservative - it uses maximum elevations to preserve
flow restrictions in overlap zones.

class BlockedObstruction:
    """
    Represents a single blocked obstruction segment in a cross section.

    HEC-RAS blocked obstructions define areas where flow is completely blocked
    up to the specified elevation (e.g., buildings, walls, solid structures).

    Attributes:
        start_sta: Start station (left/upstream edge)
        end_sta: End station (right/downstream edge)
        elevation: Elevation up to which flow is blocked

    Note:
        The __post_init__ method automatically swaps start_sta and end_sta
        if they are inverted (ensures start_sta < end_sta).

    Create non-overlapping obstruction envelope using max elevation dominance.

    This is the core algorithm for fixing overlapping blocked obstructions.
    It preserves hydraulic behavior by using the maximum (most restrictive)
    elevation in any overlap zone.

    Algorithm:
        1. Collect all critical stations (start/end of each obstruction)
        2. For each segment between critical stations, find max elevation
           at the midpoint from all obstructions covering that segment
        3. Merge adjacent segments with identical elevations
        4. Insert 0.02-unit gaps where different elevations meet

    Args:
        obstructions: List of potentially overlapping obstructions.

    Returns:
        List of non-overlapping obstructions with HEC-RAS compliant gaps.

    Example:

        ...     BlockedObstruction(100, 120, 5.0),
        ...     BlockedObstruction(110, 130, 3.0)  # overlaps 110-120
        ... ]
        >>> fixed = create_elevation_envelope(original)
        >>> # Result: segments with max elevation at each point
        >>> # 100-120 @ 5.0 (higher), gap, 120.02-130 @ 3.0
