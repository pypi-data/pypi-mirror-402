# MindRoom Security Action Plan

**Updated:** September 17, 2025

## Executive Summary

MindRoom has addressed the most acute blockers identified in the initial security review (unauthenticated admin APIs, default credentials, and missing rate limiting). However, several high-risk items remain open—most notably secrets lifecycle verification, monitoring/alerting coverage, and internal service encryption. The platform is **not yet production ready** until these gaps are closed and the residual tasks in the checklist are completed.

**Current Risk Assessment: 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH** – Staging-only. Proceed to production **after** completing outstanding High items.

**Implementation Status (September 17, 2025):**
- ✅ **P0 Legal/Regulatory:** GDPR flows and log sanitization implemented; helper scripts exist for key rotation.
- ✅ **P1.1 Auth Security:** Auth monitoring, IP blocking, and admin route protections deployed.
- ⚠️ **P1.2 Infrastructure:** K8s Secrets mounted as files, but etcd-at-rest encryption and documented rotation remain unverified.
- ⚠️ **P2 Monitoring:** Alerting, dashboards, and incident runbooks still pending (logs available for manual review).

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (✅ COMPLETED)

### P0: Critical Authentication & Data Exposure Fixes

1. **ADMIN ENDPOINT AUTHENTICATION** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** All admin endpoints properly secured with `verify_admin` dependency
   - **Implementation:** Authentication required for all administrative operations
   - **Verification:** Security review confirmed proper access controls

2. **REVOKE & ROTATE ALL EXPOSED API KEYS** 🔑 ⚠️
   - **✅ Helpers in repo:** `scripts/rotate-api-keys.sh` and `scripts/apply-rotated-keys.sh`
   - **⚠️ Pending:** Confirm actual rotation for DeepSeek, Google, and OpenRouter keys (last known exposure in docs)
   - **⚠️ Pending:** Generate and store a rotation report (no `P0_2_SECRET_ROTATION_REPORT.md` exists)
   - **Next step:** Schedule rotation run + verification before granting production access

3. **REMOVE .env FROM GIT HISTORY** 📝 ⚠️
   - Command stub retained below; confirm it has been executed on any shared repositories before launch.
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   git push --force --all
   git push --force --tags
   ```

4. **DEFAULT PASSWORDS REPLACEMENT** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** All default passwords removed from configurations
   - **Implementation:** Helm templates generate strong secrets by default
   - **Docker Compose:** Requires explicit password configuration (no defaults)
   - **Security:** No "changeme" passwords remain in tracked configs

---

## ✅ COMPLETED SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS

### P0: Legal/Regulatory Compliance (COMPLETED)

**Logging Sanitization:**
- **Frontend:** Production logger prevents all console output (`lib/logger.ts`)
- **Backend:** Automatic PII redaction in production logs (`utils/log_sanitizer.py`)
- **Result:** Zero sensitive data exposure in production logs

**GDPR Compliance:**
- **Data Export:** Complete personal data export in JSON format (`/my/gdpr/export-data`)
- **Data Deletion:** Soft delete with 7-day grace period (`/my/gdpr/request-deletion`)
- **Consent Management:** User consent preferences (`/my/gdpr/consent`)
- **Result:** Full GDPR Article compliance

**Soft Delete Implementation:**
- **Database:** Migration 004 adds soft delete capabilities
- **Functions:** `soft_delete_account()`, `restore_account()`, `hard_delete_account()`
- **Grace Period:** 7-day recovery window
- **Result:** Data lifecycle management with audit trail

### P1.1: Authentication Security (COMPLETED)

**Auth Failure Tracking:**
- **Implementation:** `auth_monitor.py` with module-level functions (KISS)
- **IP Blocking:** Automatic blocking after 5 failures in 15 minutes
- **Block Duration:** 30 minutes with automatic expiry
- **Audit Logging:** All authentication events tracked with graceful failure handling
- **Integration:** Embedded in `verify_user()` dependency
- **Result:** Protection against brute force, credential stuffing, and account enumeration

## 🔄 REMAINING ITEMS (Low Priority)

### P1.2: Infrastructure Security (⚠️ IN PROGRESS)

**Secrets lifecycle:**
- ✅ K8s secrets are mounted as read-only files at `/etc/secrets` and consumed via `_get_secret()`.
- ⚠️ Need to verify etcd-at-rest encryption for the target cluster before launch.
- ⚠️ Document a tested rotation run (helper scripts exist but have not been executed/end-to-end).

**Runtime hardening:**
- ⚠️ Platform deployments still run as root; update manifests with `securityContext` (see example below).
- ✅ Instance Helm chart already drops Linux capabilities and sets resource requests/limits.

**Example securityContext to apply:**
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### P2: Monitoring & IR (IN PROGRESS)

**Prometheus Deployment (✅ COMPLETE)**
- ✅ ServiceMonitor + PrometheusRule deployed for auth/admin events
- ✅ Metrics exposed (`mindroom_auth_events_total`, `mindroom_admin_verifications_total`, `mindroom_blocked_ips`)
- ✅ Scrape verified (Prometheus target UP)
- ➡️ Documented in SECURITY_REVIEW_11

**Alert Routing (⚠️ TODO)**
- Configure Alertmanager receivers (email/Slack/PagerDuty)
- Produce on-call/IR runbook and notification matrix
- Publish security@ mailbox & security.txt (ties into IR comms)

**Dashboards & Reporting (⚠️ TODO / LOW)**
- Stand up Grafana/Metabase dashboards for the new metrics
- Automate weekly/monthly security reports once routing is in place

**Incident Response (⚠️ TODO)**
- Draft playbook covering triage, escalation, postmortems
- Align with compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR breach notification)

9. **Move Secrets from Environment Variables to Volumes** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** Already implemented in `deployment-backend.yaml`
   - **Implementation:** Secrets mounted as files at `/etc/secrets`
   ```yaml
   volumeMounts:
   - name: api-keys
     mountPath: /etc/secrets
     readOnly: true
   ```

## 📅 Implementation Timeline (Progress)

### Phase 1: Critical Security (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ P0: GDPR export/delete + log sanitization
- ✅ P1.1: Authentication monitoring & admin locking
- ⚠️ Secrets management: helper scripts present but full rotation + etcd verification outstanding

### Phase 2: Operational Hardening (Blocking Production)
- ⚠️ Build alerting, dashboards, and incident response playbook
- ⚠️ Enforce non-root containers and document mTLS/internal TLS plan
- ⚠️ Automate dependency and secret scanning in CI/CD

**Total effort spent so far:** ~3 engineering days (multiple follow-ups remaining)

## 🚫 Production Readiness Status

**NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION.** Launch is gated on:

1. 🔴 Verified rotation (and confirmation) for previously exposed API keys
2. 🔴 Monitoring/alerting + incident response coverage
3. 🔴 Infrastructure hardening (non-root pods, internal TLS decision)
4. 🔴 Completion of outstanding High/Medium items in `SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

Re-run this action plan after the above are delivered.
