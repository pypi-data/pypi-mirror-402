# Charm: The Unified Platform for Agentic Intelligence

> **Charm Store** is now live. Register your agent and explore what the community has built!

**Charm** is a **Unified System Layer** designed to provide a unified environment for capability integration and application distribution for agentic intelligence.

It provides a standardized architecture that enables agents to assemble, interoperate, and scale across heterogeneous ecosystems, turning them into real, commercial-ready applications.

## Why Charm?

Before you dive deeper, I’d like you to take a moment to read the [blog post](https://charmos.io/blog) to understand our insights and perspective.

## Getting started

### Installation

Charm is available on PyPI. We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for the best experience.

#### Standard Setup (For Agent Development)

If you only want to build and define agents

```bash
uv add charmos
# or
pip install charmos
```

#### Advanced Setup (For Local Cloud Runner)

If you want to simulate the isolated cloud environment locally

```bash
uv add charmos[runner]
# or
pip install charmos[runner]
```

> **Note:** To use the docker simulation mode, you must have Docker Desktop or Docker Engine running on your machine.
