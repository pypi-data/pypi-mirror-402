Automatically assigns analytic distributions to purchase order lines based
on the sale's warehouse.

This module extends analytic distribution models to support warehouse-based
automatic assignment in sale orders. When you create a sale order, the
system automatically applies the appropriate analytic distribution based on
the origin warehouse.
