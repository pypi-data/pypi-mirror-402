Automatically assigns analytic distributions to purchase order lines
based on the sale's warehouse.

This module extends analytic distribution models to support
warehouse-based automatic assignment in sale orders. When you create a
sale order, the system automatically applies the appropriate analytic
distribution based on the origin warehouse.

Configuration
=============

To configure the analytic distributions:

1. Go to **Accounting > Configuration > Analytic Distribution Models**
2. Create a new distribution model or edit an existing one
3. Set the **Warehouse** field to specify which warehouse this model
   applies to
4. Configure your analytic accounts and percentages
5. Save the model

Usage
=====

The module works automatically:

1. Create a sale order
2. Add products to order lines
3. The system automatically applies analytic distribution based on the
   order warehouse
4. Confirm the order

The analytic distribution appears in the **Analytic Distribution** field
on each sale order line.

**Note:** Manual changes to the analytic distribution field are still
possible if needed.
