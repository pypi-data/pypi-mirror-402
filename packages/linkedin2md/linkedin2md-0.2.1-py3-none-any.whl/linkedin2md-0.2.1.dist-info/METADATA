Convert LinkedIn data exports to clean Markdown files - the ideal format for LLM analysis.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is the lingua franca of AI tools. Once your LinkedIn data is in `.md` format, you can:

- **Upload to [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)** and have conversations about your career history
- **Use [Claude Projects](https://claude.ai)** to analyze patterns across your professional journey
- **Feed to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** with AI plugins for a personal career knowledge base
- **Run local LLMs** (Ollama, LM Studio) for completely private analysis

### Example Prompts

Once your LinkedIn data is in an LLM, try asking:

| Question | Data Used |
|----------|-----------|
| "What patterns do you see in my career transitions?" | experience.md |
| "What skills have I developed over time?" | skills.md, experience.md |
| "Group my connections by industry" | connections.md |
| "What themes appear in my recommendations?" | recommendations.md |
| "Summarize my job applications and outcomes" | job_applications.md |
| "What qualities do people consistently mention about me?" | recommendations.md, endorsements.md |
| "Based on my experience, what roles should I target?" | All files |

## Installation

**Recommended** (using pipx - installs in isolated environment):
```bash
pipx install linkedin2md
```

Or with pip (in a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install linkedin2md
```

> **Note**: On modern Linux systems (Debian, Ubuntu 23.04+, Fedora), use `pipx` to avoid the "externally-managed-environment" error.

## Usage

```bash
linkedin2md Complete_LinkedInDataExport.zip
linkedin2md export.zip -o ./my-profile
linkedin2md export.zip --lang es
```

Then drag the output folder into your favorite AI tool.

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `source` | LinkedIn ZIP export file (required) | - |
| `-o, --output` | Output directory | `linkedin_export` |
| `--lang` | Output language (`en` or `es`) | `en` |

## How to Export Your LinkedIn Data

Follow these steps to download your LinkedIn data:

1. **Go to Settings**: Log into LinkedIn, click your profile photo in the top right, then select **"Settings & Privacy"**

2. **Navigate to Data Privacy**: In the left sidebar, click **"Data privacy"**

3. **Request your data**: Click **"Get a copy of your data"**

4. **Select data to download**: 
   - Choose **"Download larger data archive"** for complete data
   - Or select specific categories if you only need certain data

5. **Request archive**: Click **"Request archive"**

6. **Wait for email**: LinkedIn will process your request and send an email when ready (usually within 24 hours, sometimes up to 72 hours for large archives)

7. **Download the ZIP file**: Click the download link in the email. The file will be named something like `Complete_LinkedInDataExport_01-20-2025.zip`

> **Note**: The download link expires after a few days. Download it promptly and store it safely.
