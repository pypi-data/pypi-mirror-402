Questions:
1) What problem does the paper try to solve?
2) What related research exists? (separate: strongest baseline, closest approach, orthogonal directions)
3) How does the paper solve the problem? (include a text flowchart)
4) What datasets and implementation settings are used? Why these datasets/scenarios, and which key properties do they validate?
5) What are the metrics and results? List metrics, summarize results, and explain which innovation each metric reflects.
6) What can be further explored? (split by theory/engineering/data/evaluation)
7) How would this work in real-world scenarios? (deployment constraints, compute, latency, robustness)
8) Summarize the main content (one paragraph + 5 bullets + one core formula/mechanism)
