## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

If you do not have a uv virtual environment, you can create one with:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

**Note:** We recommend using uv to install the package due to the incredible speed of the package manager. The package can still be installed via pip directly, but it will be slower.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install voicerun_completions
```

### From Source

```bash
uv pip install .
```
