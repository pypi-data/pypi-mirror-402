Task: Initialize or update PaperPipe integration in this project's agent instructions.

Steps:
1. Run `papi docs` to get the current agent integration snippet
2. Find the agent instructions file in the repo root (check in order: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md)
   - If none exist, create AGENTS.md
3. Look for an existing `## Paper References (PaperPipe)` section in the file
4. If the section exists: replace it entirely (from `## Paper References (PaperPipe)` up to the next `##` heading or end of file)
5. If no such section exists: append the snippet at the end of the file
6. Show the user what changed (diff or summary)

Notes:
- The snippet from `papi docs` starts with introductory text and a markdown code block containing `## Paper References (PaperPipe)`
- Extract only the content inside the code block (lines between the triple backticks)
- Do NOT include the `<details>` glossary section from `papi docs` output
- Preserve all existing content in the agent instructions file
