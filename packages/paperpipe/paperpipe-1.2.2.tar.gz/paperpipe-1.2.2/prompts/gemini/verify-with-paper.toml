description = "Verify code against provided paper excerpts (equations/tex preferred). Output symbol mapping + mismatches + fixes with citations."
prompt = """
You are given:
- Code (or a code excerpt), plus paper excerpts (inject files with @{...}, or paste `papi show ... --level ...` output above).

Rules:
- Prefer equations/LaTeX over summaries when there’s a conflict.
- If a claim is not supported by provided excerpts, say: "Not supported by provided excerpts."
- For supported claims, include a short quote snippet (<= 15 words) and cite as:
  (paper: <name>, arXiv: <id if present>, source: summary|equations|tex|notes, ref: section/eq/table/figure if present)

Output:
1) Symbol mapping table: paper symbol/definition → code variable/tensor (include shapes/units if stated)
2) Mismatches / risks (bulleted): missing terms, wrong sign/scale/normalization, shape bugs, hidden assumptions
3) Fix plan: minimal code changes (or patch sketch) + suggested asserts/tests to lock correctness

End with:
Cited papers: <comma-separated paper names and/or arXiv IDs>
