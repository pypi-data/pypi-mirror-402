You can create concurrent\nenvironments to choose your own parameter settings (refer to the\nconcurrent optimization section for details). The intent of concurrent\nMIP solving is to introduce additional diversity into the MIP search.\nThis approach can sometimes solve models much faster than applying all\navailable threads to a single MIP solve, especially on very large\nparallel machines.\n\nThe concurrent MIP solver divides available threads evenly among the\nindependent solves. For example, if you have 6 threads available and\nyou set ConcurrentMIP to 2, the concurrent MIP solver will allocate 3\nthreads to each independent solve. Note that the number of independent\nsolves launched will not exceed the number of available threads.\n\nThe concurrent MIP solver produces a slightly different log from the\nstandard MIP solver, and provides different callbacks as well. Please\nrefer to the concurrent optimizer discussion for additional details.\n\nConcurrent MIP is not deterministic. If runtimes for different\nindependent solves are very similar, and if the model has multiple\noptimal solutions, you may get slightly different results from\nmultiple runs on the same model.\n\nNote:\n\n  Only affects mixed integer programming (MIP) models",

The best-known example is probably a *trickle flow*,\nwhere a continuous variable that is meant to be zero when an\nassociated binary variable is zero instead takes a non-trivial value.\nMore precisely, given a constraint y \\leq M b, where y is a non-\nnegative continuous variable, b is a binary variable, and M is a\nconstant that captures the largest possible value of y, the constraint\nis intended to enforce the relationship that y must be zero if b is\nzero. With the default integer feasibility tolerance, the binary\nvariable is allowed to take a value as large as 1e-5 while still being\nconsidered as taking value zero. If the M value is large, then the M b\nupper bound on the y variable can be substantial.\n\nReducing the value of the IntFeasTol parameter can mitigate the\neffects of such trickle flows, but often at a significant cost, and\noften with limited success. The IntegralityFocus parameter provides a\nbetter alternative. Setting this parameter to 1 requests that the\nsolver work harder to try to avoid solutions that exploit integrality\ntolerances. More precisely, the solver tries to find solutions that\nare still (nearly) feasible if all integer variables are rounded to\nexact integral values.

    "description": "Controls whether and how Gurobi uses warm start information for an LP\noptimization. A warm start can consist of any combination of basis\nstatuses, a primal start vector, or a dual start vector. It is\nspecified using the attributes VBasis and CBasis or PStart and DStart\non the original model.\n\nSetting this parameter to 2 is particularly useful for communicating\nadvanced start information while retaining the performance benefits of\npresolve. The default value of -1 is equivalent to 1 for all Method\nchoices except for PDHG, for which it is equivalent to 2.\n\nAs a general rule, setting this parameter to 0 ignores any start\ninformation and solves the model from scratch. Setting it to 1 (the\ndefault) uses the provided warm start information to solve the\noriginal, unpresolved problem, regardless of whether presolve is\nenabled. Setting it to 2 uses the start information to solve the\npresolved problem, assuming that presolve is enabled. This involves\nmapping the solution of the original problem into an equivalent (or\nsometimes nearly equivalent) crushed solution of the presolved\nproblem. If presolve is disabled, then setting 2 still prioritizes\nstart vectors, while setting 1 prioritizes basis statuses. Taken\ntogether, the LPWarmStart parameter setting, the LP algorithm\nspecified by Gurobi\u2019s Method parameter, and the available advanced\nstart information determine whether Gurobi will use basis statuses\nonly, basis statuses augmented with information from start vectors, or\na basis obtained by applying the crossover method to the provided\nprimal and dual start vectors to jump start the optimization.\n\nWhen Gurobi\u2019s Method parameter requests the barrier solver, primal and\ndual start vectors are prioritized over basis statuses (but only if\nyou provide both). These start vectors are fed to the crossover\nprocedure. This is the same crossover that is used to compute a basic\nsolution from the interior solution produced by the core barrier\nalgorithm, but in this case crossover is started from arbitrary start\nvectors. If you set the LPWarmStart parameter to 1, crossover will be\ninvoked on the original model using the provided vectors. Any provided\nbasis information will not be used in this case. If you set\nLPWarmStart to 2, crossover will be invoked on the presolved model\nusing crushed start vectors. If you set the parameter to 2 and provide\na basis but no start vectors, the basis will be used to compute the\ncorresponding primal and dual solutions on the original model. Those\nsolutions will then be crushed and used as primal and dual start\nvectors for the crossover, which will then construct a basis for the\npresolved model. Note that for all of these settings and start\ncombinations, no barrier algorithm iterations are performed.\n\nWhen the Method parameter selects PDHG, primal and dual start vectors\nare used to warm start PDHG iterations directly before proceeding to\ncrossover if it is enabled. If a warm start basis is provided, it will\nbe used to construct start vectors for the PDHG solve. If both a basis\nand vectors are given, vectors are prioritised over basis statuses. If\nyou set LPWarmStart to 1, start vectors will be used to warm-start\nPDHG on the original model. Otherwise, if presolve is enabled, start\nvectors will be crushed and used to warm-start PDHG on the presolved\nmodel.\n\nThe simplex algorithms provide more warm-starting options. With a\nparameter value of 1, simplex will start from a provided basis, if\navailable. Otherwise, it uses a provided start vector to refine the\ncrash basis it computes. Primal simplex will use PStart and dual\nsimplex will use DStart in this refinement process.\n\nWith a value of 2, simplex will use the crushed start vector on the\npresolved model (PStart for primal simplex, DStart for dual) to refine\nthe crash basis. This is true regardless of whether the start is\nderived from start vectors or a starting basis from the original\nmodel.  The difference is that if you provide an advanced basis, the\nbasis will be used to compute the corresponding primal and dual\nsolutions on the original model from which the primal or dual start on\nthe presolved model will be derived.\n\nNote:\n\n  Only affects linear programming (LP) models",

The default setting (1) allows you to use new variables and\nconstraints immediately for building or modifying the model.

However, these details will show through when you try\nto query modified model information.\n\nIn the Gurobi interface, model modifications (bound changes, right-\nhand side changes, objective changes, etc.) are placed in a queue.\nThese queued modifications are applied to the model at three times:\nwhen you call \"update\", when you call \"optimize\", or when you call\n\"write\" to write the model to disk. When you query information about\nthe model, the result will depend on both *whether* that information\nwas modified and *when* it was modified. In particular, no matter what\nsetting of UpdateMode you use, if the modification is sitting in the\nqueue, you\u2019ll get the result from before the modification.\n\nTo expand on this a bit, all attribute modifications are actually\nplaced in a queue. This includes attributes that may not traditionally\nbe viewed as being part of the model, including things like variable\nbranching priorities, constraint basis statuses, etc. Querying the\nvalues of these attributes will return their previous values if\nsubsequent modifications are still in the queue.\n\nThe only potential benefit to changing the parameter to 0 is that in\nunusual cases this setting may allow simplex to make more aggressive\nuse of warm-start information after a model modification.\n\nIf you want to change this parameter, you need to set it as soon as\nyou create your Gurobi environment.\n\nNote that you still need to call \"update\" to modify an attribute on an\nSOS constraint, quadratic constraint, or general constraint.",
