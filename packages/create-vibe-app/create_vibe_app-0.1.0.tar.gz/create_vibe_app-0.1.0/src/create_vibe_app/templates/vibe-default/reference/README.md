2. AI will consult these when implementing similar features
3. Mention specific references in requirements if needed

## What to Include
- Similar features from other projects
- Open source implementations
- Code snippets demonstrating patterns
- Third-party library examples

## Tips
- Keep references focused and relevant
- Include comments explaining what's good about the code
- Remove irrelevant parts to keep it concise
