# Kleinkram: CLI

Install the package

```bash
pip install kleinkram
```

Run the CLI

```bash
klein
```

## Usage

Here are some basic examples of how to use the CLI.

### Listing Files

To list all files in a mission:

```bash
klein list -p project-name -m mission-name
```

### Uploading Files

To upload all `*.bag` files in the current directory to a mission:

```bash
klein upload -p project-name -m mission-name *.bag
```

If you would like to create a new mission on upload use the `--create` flag.

### Downloading Files

To download all files from a mission and save them `out`:

```bash
klein download -p project-name -m mission-name --dest out
```

You can additionally specify filenames or ids if you only want to download specific files.

Instead of downloading files from a specified mission you can download arbitrary files by specifying their ids:

```bash
klein download --dest out *id1* *id2* *id3*
```

For more information consult the [documentation](https://docs.datasets.leggedrobotics.com//usage/python/setup).

## Development

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leggedrobotics/kleinkram.git
cd kleinkram/cli
```

Setup the environment

```bash
virtualenv -ppython3.8 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
```

Install `pre-commit` hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Run the CLI

```bash
klein --help
```

### Run Tests
to run unit tests:
```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```
to run all tests (including e2e and integration tests):
```bash
pytest
```
For the latter you need to have an instance of the backend running locally.
See instructions in the root of the repository for this.
On top of that these tests require particular files to be present in the `cli/tests/data` directory.
These files are automatically generated by the `cli/tests/generate_test_data.py` script.

You also need to make sure to be logged in with the cli with `klein login`.
