Hadronization is the phase whereby partons turn into hadrons. 
Alternatively it is called Fragmentation. In this section 
fragmentation will be used for the key step where colour fields 
break up into hadrons, while hadronization denotes the broader 
concept of all physics that follow the perturbative description. 
The prime example of such further non-fragmentation aspects is 
particle decays, but one may also include colour reconnection, 
the beam remnant structure and other diverse topics.

<h3>The main fragmentation switch</h3> 
 
The fragmentation part of the PYTHIA code is in the process of being 
reorganized, so as to allow a greater flexibility. The intention is 
to allow new fragmentation models, either as part of the standard 
distribution or linked externally, similarly to what has been possible 
for parton showers since 2018. A first step was taken in version 
8.313, where new top-level fragmentation classes were introduced, 
and it became possible to link in external fragmentation models. 
A second step, in 8.316, is the factoring out  of thermal string 
fragmentation from the normal Lund string fragmentation. Further 
steps are foreseen in the future. 
 
<p/> 
From a user point of view, the main news is a switch between 
internally implemented fragmentation models. It is put here, 
so as to make it easily found. Below this, and in linked pages, 
a more detailed description of the class hierarchy, the physics 
contents and the free settings will follow.

<a name="transitionPhase"></a> 
<a name="section1"></a> 
<h3>The transition phase</h3> 
 
Some code components lie close to the borderline between the 
perturbative partonic world, represented by the PartonLevel 
code section, and the non-perturbative one, in the HadronLevel code. 
Three have been put here, mainly because their usefulness lie 
squarely in the nonperturbative domain. 
<ul> 
<li>The <a href="BeamRemnants.html" target="page">beam remnants</a> handling 
is the step where the remnants of the incoming beams, after a 
number of partons have been extracted to initiate multiparton 
interactions (MPIs), are split into a set of partons (and 
occasionally a hadron) that share the remnant momentum. This 
sharing is governed by ad-hoc nonperturbative rules. 
</li> 
<li><a href="ColourReconnection.html" target="page">Colour reconnection</a> 
is the notion that the presence of multiple colour charges in an 
event leads to the possibility for the naive colour topology 
to be modified, e.g. to configurations with shorter strings. 
Although defined in terms of parton colour properties, colour 
reconnection only has a meaning in the context of fragmentation 
patterns. 
</li> 
<li>The 
<a href="PartonVertexInformation.html" target="page">parton vertex information</a> 
notably distributes parton in the transverse collision plane, 
related to hadron or nuclear spatial wave functions, and so is 
nonperturbative in its nature. This info can be used e.g. to map 
out the almond-shaped collision region in nucleus-nucleus collisions. 
</li> 
</ul>

<a name="section2"></a> 
<h3>The main fragmentation classes</h3> 
 
Now for an overview of the current main components of the 
fragmentation framework. 
<ul> 
<li><code>FragmentationModel</code> is the top-level class. 
It is intended that all fragmentation models should derive from 
this class, even if it is not quite true currently. It does not 
do anything, but expects the derived class to implement the two 
main methods <code>init</code> and <code>fragment</code>. It 
contains pointers to the commonly used <code>StringFlav</code>, 
<code>StringPT</code> and <code>StringZ</code>, but it is open to 
you whether to use them. 
</li> 
<li><code>LundFragmentation</code> derives from 
<code>FragmentationModel</code>. It is a small class, organizing 
the real work to be done in <code>StringFragmentation</code> and 
<code>MiniStringFragmentation</code>. 
</li> 
<li><code>ThermalFragmentation</code> also derives from 
<code>FragmentationModel</code>, and the code closely follows 
the one in <code>LundFragmentation</code>. The key difference it 
that it has its own classes of the <code>StringFlav</code> and 
<code>StringPT</code> kind. 
</li> 
<li><code>StringFragmentation</code> is the main class for handling 
the fragmentation of a partonic subsystem into a set of primary 
hadrons. Most of the machinery here cannot easily be changed, 
but the flexibility comes from the free choice of classes 
derived from <code>StringFlav</code>, <code>StringPT</code> and 
<code>StringZ</code>. 
</li> 
<li><code>MiniStringFragmentation</code> takes over from 
<code>StringFragmentation</code> when the mass of the fragmenting 
system is so small that only one or two hadrons can be produced. 
It also uses classes derived from <code>StringFlav</code>, 
<code>StringPT</code> and <code>StringZ</code>, but the latter 
two only marginally. 
</li> 
<li><code>StringFlav</code> handled the selection of a new quark or 
diquark flavour, and the combination of an old and a new flavour 
into a hadron. A key aspect of essentially all alternative 
fragmentation models is that the base class is replaced by a quite 
different derived one. The <code>StringFlav</code> class is used 
not only in <code>StringFragmentation</code> and 
<code>MiniStringFragmentation</code> but also in a few other places, 
notably in some particle decays. 
</li> 
<li><code>StringPT</code> handles the selection of transverse momentum 
<i>pT</i> in the breakup of a string, assumed to compensate exactly 
between the quark and antiquark (or diquark-antidiquark) of a break. 
</li> 
<li><code>StringZ</code> selects the lightcone energy-momentum fraction 
<i>z</i> to be taken by a newly produced hadron, out of what remains 
after previous hadron production. For strings with gluon kinks 
a more intricate procedure needs to be applied [<a href="Bibliography.html#refSjo84" target="page">Sjo84</a>]. 
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<a name="specialClasses"></a> 
<a name="section3"></a> 
<h3>Special fragmentation classes</h3> 
 
In addition to the <code>LundFragmentation</code> and 
<code>ThermalFragmentation</code> options, intended to cover 
ordinary fragmentation, there are a few other classes for 
special applications. 
<ul> 
<li> <code>HiddenValleyFragmentation</code> handles the fragmentation 
in a hypothetical 
<a href="HiddenValleyProcesses.html" target="page">hidden sector</a>, using the normal 
<code>StringFragmentation</code> and <code>MiniStringFragmentation</code> 
classes, but with derived <code>StringFlav</code>, <code>StringPT</code> 
and <code>StringZ</code> classes. Notably the flavour handling is 
quite separate from the normal Standard Model one. Many fragmentation 
parameters are rescaled from the normal values, including some "safety 
check" cutoffs. 
</li> 
<li><code>RHadrons</code> handles the decay of 
<a href="RHadrons.html" target="page">R hadrons</a>, i.e. long-lived particles 
hypothesized to exist in some Beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, 
such as gluinos, stops and sbottoms. The decays typically are into 
quarks and gluons, which are handled by the normal shower and string 
fragmentation methods, but the normal <code>StringFlav</code> and 
<code>StringZ</code> objects find some use in the 
<code>RHadrons</code> class. 
</li> 
<li><code>LowEnergyProcess</code> is primarily intended for low-energy 
<a href="HadronicRescattering.html" target="page">hadronic rescattering</a> 
in high-energy collisions, but can also be used for 
<a href="QCDLowEnergyProcesses.html" target="page">low-energy processes</a>, 
e.g. as needed in the simulation of the final stages of cosmic-ray 
cascades. It mainly uses its own dedicated methods for various 
processes, usually 2&rarr;2 and 2&rarr;3 ones, but for the 
higher-energy tail (still only a few GeV) the 
<code>StringFragmentation</code> and <code>MiniStringFragmentation</code> 
classes can be used. 
</li> 
</ul> 
 
The user can implement other such extra classes, and link them in, as 
described on the 
<a href="ImplementNewFragmentation.html" target="page">Implement New Fragmentation</a> 
page. 
 
<a name="othercode"></a> 
<a name="section4"></a> 
<h3>Other fragmentation code</h3> 
 
The standard string fragmentation routines contain some embedded code 
that is not part of the baseline setup, but offers relevant extensions 
to it. These include 
<ul> 
<li>Several methods are in place to allow the user to reweight generated 
events in the parameters of the fragmentation model. This allows 
the user to perform fast parameter variation or oversample rare 
configurations, and reweight to the correct cross section. These 
methods are documented on the 
<a href="HadronizationVariations.html" target="page">Hadronization Variations</a> 
page. 
</li> 
<li>When several strings come close or overlap they may form strings 
of a higher colour representation, so-called ropes, and/or they may repel 
each other, so-called shove. A scenario exists for these phenomena, 
see <a href="RopeHadronization.html" target="page">Rope Hadronization</a>. This 
scenario could one day be extracted into separate classes, notably for 
flavour handling, but is currently hardcoded as options or additions 
inside the normal string fragmentation routines. 
</li> 
<li>The <a href="ClosePacking.html" target="page">close-packing</a> scenario is 
a similar but simpler approach to the one above, again relevant for 
the case of several nearby strings, and again hardcoded inside the 
existing routines. 
</li> 
<li>The space-time evolution of the fragmentation process mirrors the 
energy-momentum one, with some twists, but by default is not 
reconstructed. For applications such as hadronic rescattering the 
<a href="HadronVertexInformation.html" target="page">hadron production vertices </a> 
need to be reconstructed, however, and this is then done inside the 
string fragmentation methods. 
</li> 
</ul> 
 
The models for 
<a href="BoseEinsteinEffects.html" target="page">Bose-Einstein effects</a> and 
<a href="DeuteronProduction.html" target="page">deuteron production</a> also are 
extensions of the basic fragmentation framework, but do not overlap 
with the string fragmentation code. 
 
<p/> 
Finally, note that the fragmentation routines normally are not called 
by the user, but as part of the full PYTHIA event generation. The 
<a href="HadronLevelStandalone.html" target="page">Hadron-Level Standalone</a> 
page explains how to set up your own partonic configuration and then 
fragment it.
