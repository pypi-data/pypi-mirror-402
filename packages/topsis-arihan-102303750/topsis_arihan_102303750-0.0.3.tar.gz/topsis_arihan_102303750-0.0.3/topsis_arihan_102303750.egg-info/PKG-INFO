# USER MANUAL  
## TOPSIS – Arihan (102303750)

---

## 1. Overview

`topsis-arihan-102303750` is a Python command-line tool that implements the  
**Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**.

TOPSIS is a **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** technique used to rank a set of alternatives based on multiple evaluation criteria.  
The alternative closest to the ideal best solution and farthest from the ideal worst solution is ranked highest.

This package is developed for **Project-1 (UCS633)**.

---

## 2. System Requirements

- Python version **3.7 or higher**
- Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux
- Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`

---

## 3. Installation

Install the package from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install topsis-arihan-102303750
```
After installation, the command topsis becomes available in the terminal.
## 4. Command-Line Usage

### 4.1 General Syntax
```bash
topsis <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputFile>
```

### 4.2 Description of Parameters

**InputDataFile**  
CSV file containing the alternatives and criteria.

**Weights**  
Comma-separated numeric values representing the importance of each criterion.

**Impacts**  
Comma-separated symbols indicating the nature of each criterion:  
`+` → Benefit criterion (higher value is better)  
`-` → Cost criterion (lower value is better)

**OutputFile**  
Name of the CSV file where results will be saved.

---

## 5. Example Usage

### 5.1 Input File (`data.csv`)

```csv
Student,Marks,Attendance(%),Assignments,ProjectScore
S1,85,92,80,78
S2,78,88,85,82
S3,90,95,92,90
S4,72,80,75,70
S5,88,90,88,85
S6,65,75,70,68
S7,82,85,80,76
S8,95,98,96,94
S9,70,82,78,72
S10,86,89,84,81
```

The first column is treated as an identifier (Student ID).  
All remaining columns must contain numeric criteria.

---

### 5.2 Weights and Impacts Used

Weights:  
`3,1,2,4`

Impacts:  
`+,-,+,+`

---

### 5.3 Command Executed

```bash
topsis data.csv "3,1,2,4" "+,-,+,+" output.csv
```

---

## 6. Output Description

The output file contains:
- Original data
- Topsis Score (closeness coefficient)
- Rank (1 indicates the best alternative)

### 6.1 Output File (`output.csv`)

```csv
Student,Marks,Attendance(%),Assignments,ProjectScore,Topsis Score,Rank
S1,85,92,80,78,0.49,6
S2,78,88,85,82,0.50,5
S3,90,95,92,90,0.81,2
S4,72,80,75,70,0.19,9
S5,88,90,88,85,0.69,3
S6,65,75,70,68,0.13,10
S7,82,85,80,76,0.42,7
S8,95,98,96,94,0.87,1
S9,70,82,78,72,0.20,8
S10,86,89,84,81,0.57,4
```
## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

- Input CSV must contain only numeric values after the first column.
- Number of weights and impacts must match the number of criteria.
- Higher TOPSIS score implies better ranking.
- Missing or categorical values are not supported.

---

## 8. Error Handling

The program performs validation and displays appropriate error messages for:
- Incorrect number of command-line arguments.
- File not found.
- Non-numeric values in criteria columns.
- Mismatch in number of criteria, weights, and impacts.
- Invalid impact symbols (only `+` and `-` allowed).
