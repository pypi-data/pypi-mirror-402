"""Knowledge graph using NetworkX for relationship queries.

Design Decision: NetworkX DiGraph for Skill Relationships

Rationale: Use directed graph (DiGraph) to model skill dependencies
and relationships. Allows traversal for discovering related skills.

Graph Structure:
- Nodes: skill_id (with attributes: name, category, tags)
- Edges:
    - "depends_on" (from dependencies field)
    - "same_category" (skills in same category)
    - "shared_tag" (skills with common tags)

Trade-offs:
- Memory: In-memory graph vs. external graph database
- Speed: O(1) neighbor access vs. network latency
- Scalability: Limited to single-node memory vs. distributed

Alternatives Considered:
1. Neo4j: Rejected due to operational complexity for small datasets
2. SQLite with joins: Rejected due to poor graph traversal performance
3. Undirected graph: Rejected to preserve dependency direction

Persistence: Graph is serialized to pickle file for cross-session retention.
