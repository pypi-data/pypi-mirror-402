## [0.7.9] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Improved MCP tool discoverability for Claude Code's MCPSearch ([#4](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/mcp-skillset/issues/4))
- Enhanced tool docstrings with semantic keywords (find, discover, search, get, retrieve, recommend, suggest)
- MCP tools now more easily discoverable via keyword queries in MCPSearch
- PR: [#5](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/mcp-skillset/pull/5)

---

## [0.7.8] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- Fixed `list_servers` NotImplementedError when using NativeCLIStrategy by adding JSON config fallback
- Improved error handling for agent configuration reading

---

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- `ask` command now date-aware: queries like "What skills updated recently?" return time-based results
- Date queries show skills with relative timestamps (e.g., "2 weeks ago")
- Non-date queries continue to use semantic search as expected

---

## [0.7.6] - 2025-12-31

### Added

#### LLM-Powered Ask Command
- New `mcp-skillset ask` command for natural language questions
- Uses OpenRouter API for LLM responses (Claude 3 Haiku by default)
- Automatic skill context injection for relevant answers
- Configurable via environment variable or `.env` file
- Example: `mcp-skillset ask "How do I write pytest fixtures?"`

#### Skill Update Date Tracking
- Skills now track `updated_at` timestamp (file modification time)
- Stored in ChromaDB metadata for querying
- New `mcp-skillset recent` command to find recently updated skills
- Options: `--days`, `--since`, `--limit`
- Example: `mcp-skillset recent --days 30`

### Fixed
- Multi-agent installation now handles "server already exists" gracefully
- Installer error logging improved (DEBUG level for non-critical errors)
- `ask` command attribute access corrected for ScoredSkill results

### Changed
- Documentation updated to favor `uv` over `pip` for installation
- CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, and docs/ aligned with uv-first approach

### Configuration

New LLM configuration options in `~/.mcp-skillset/config.yaml`:

```yaml
llm:
  model: anthropic/claude-3-haiku
  max_tokens: 1024
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

#### Claude Code Hooks Integration
- New `mcp-skillset enrich-hook` command for `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
- Automatic skill hints during prompt submission based on semantic search
- Configurable threshold (default: 0.6) and max skills (default: 5)

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-30

### Changed

#### Complete CLI Refactoring ([1M-460](https://linear.app/1m-hyperdev/issue/1M-460))

**Major architectural improvement reducing main.py from 2,644 lines to 67 lines (-97.5%)**

This release represents a complete restructuring of the CLI architecture for improved maintainability, testability, and developer experience. All 14 CLI commands have been extracted into separate, focused modules.

**Impact:**
- **Maintainability**: Each command is now self-contained with clear responsibilities
- **Testability**: Modular structure enables better unit testing
- **Developer Experience**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend individual commands
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated 2,577 lines of monolithic code

**Architectural Changes:**

## [0.6.8] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- **Installer Default Behavior** ([1M-408](https://linear.app/1m-hyperdev/issue/1M-408))
  - Default installer now excludes Claude Desktop to avoid config conflicts
  - `mcp-skillset install` and `mcp-skillset setup` now only install for Claude Code and Auggie by default
  - Users wanting Claude Desktop must explicitly use `--agent claude-desktop`
  - Prevents conflicts between Claude Desktop and Claude Code (similar config paths)
- **Agent Name Display** ([1M-409](https://linear.app/1m-hyperdev/issue/1M-409))
  - Installer now correctly displays "Claude Code" for Claude Code paths
  - Prevents user confusion about which agent is being configured
  - Added 6 regression tests for agent name detection

### Testing
- 9 new tests added for installer behavior
- `tests/cli/test_install_defaults.py` - Default behavior validation
- `tests/test_agent_installer.py` - Enhanced agent detection tests
- All existing tests pass

### Changed
- `src/mcp_skills/cli/main.py` - Updated install/setup command logic
- Default agents list now excludes Claude Desktop
- Agent detection logic improved for correct name display

## [0.6.7] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed MCP tools to follow object_verb naming convention
  - `search_skills` → `skills_search` - Search for skills using hybrid RAG
  - `get_skill` → `skill_get` - Get complete skill details by ID
  - `recommend_skills` → `skills_recommend` - Get skill recommendations
  - `list_categories` → `skill_categories` - List all skill categories
  - `reindex_skills` → `skills_reindex` - Rebuild skill index
  - `list_skill_templates` → `skill_templates_list` - List available templates
  - `skill_create` remains unchanged (already follows convention)

### Migration Guide
If you're using these MCP tools directly:

**Before (v0.6.6 and earlier):**
```python
await search_skills(query="pytest", limit=10)
await get_skill(skill_id="pytest-skill")
await recommend_skills(project_path="/path/to/project")
await list_categories()
await reindex_skills(force=True)
await list_skill_templates()
```

**After (v0.6.7+):**
```python
await skills_search(query="pytest", limit=10)
await skill_get(skill_id="pytest-skill")
await skills_recommend(project_path="/path/to/project")
await skill_categories()
await skills_reindex(force=True)
await skill_templates_list()
```

**Note:** If you're using the MCP server through Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or other MCP clients, the tool names in your configuration and prompts will need to be updated to use the new names.
