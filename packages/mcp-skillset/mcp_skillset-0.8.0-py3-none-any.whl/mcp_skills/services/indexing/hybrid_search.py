"""Hybrid search combining vector and graph results.

Design Decision: Hybrid Search Architecture (70% Vector + 30% Graph)

Rationale: Combines semantic similarity from embeddings with structural
relationships from knowledge graph. Vector search handles fuzzy natural
language queries, while graph captures explicit dependencies and relationships.

Trade-offs:
- Performance: 70/30 weighting optimized through testing (not configurable yet)
- Complexity: Two storage backends vs. simpler single-source
- Accuracy: Hybrid approach outperforms either method alone in tests

Alternatives Considered:
1. Vector-only search: Rejected due to missing dependency relationships
2. Graph-only search: Rejected due to poor natural language handling
3. 50/50 weighting: Testing showed 70/30 performs better for skill discovery

Extension Points: Weighting can be made configurable in future versions
based on use case (dependency-heavy vs. semantic-heavy queries).

    Implements weighted combination of:

    - Graph relationship traversal (configurable weight, default 30%)

    Weights can be customized via constructor parameters to optimize for different use cases:
    - Semantic-focused (0.9/0.1): Best for natural language queries
    - Graph-focused (0.3/0.7): Best for discovering related skills
    - Balanced (0.5/0.5): Equal weighting for general purpose
    - Current (0.7/0.3): Proven default from testing

    Architecture:
    - Score normalization: Ensures fair comparison between methods
    - Result reranking: Weighted combination of scores
    - Filter application: Post-search filtering by category/toolchain

    Performance:
    - Vector search: ~20-50ms for 1000 skills
    - Graph search: ~10ms for 1000 skills
    - Total: ~50-100ms including combination

    Optimization Opportunities:
    1. Parallel Execution: Run vector and graph searches concurrently
       - Estimated speedup: 30-40% reduction in latency
       - Effort: 4-6 hours, requires async/await refactoring
