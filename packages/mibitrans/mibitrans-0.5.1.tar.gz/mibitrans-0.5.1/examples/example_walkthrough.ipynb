The Mibitrans model allows for the same method as used in BIOSCREEN-AT, but expands it by allowing multiple source zones (by means of superposition) and including the instant reaction model. These were present in the original BIOSCREEN, but not reimplemented in BIOSCREEN-AT.

    "The equation used for the Anatrans model has the assumption that C(x,y,z,t) = C(x,t) * C(y,t) * C(z,t). Then, the 3D ADE can be broken up in three separate differential equations which can be solved individually. For C(x,t) the solution is given in Bear (1979), C(y,t) and C(z,t) can be derived from Crank (1975). The Anatrans model is the combination of these solutions, with addition of source depletion, source superposition and instant reaction model, described in Newell et al. (1997). The solution of Newell et al. (1997) is based of the Domenico (1987) solution, a truncated version of the equation described above, which introduces an error with a size dependent on the ratio of flow velocity and longitudinal dispersivity. Anatrans instead uses the fully untruncated version."

And is included for legacy reasons, since it is the first model implemented in the mibitrans package, serving as a basis for the other models. However, caution should be taken when using this model, since a varying error is introduced by using the truncated analytical solution. The error is most prominent for shorter times and distances from the source, and depends on the ratio of flow velocity and longitudinal dispersivity. For modelling, the Anatrans (untruncated approximate solution) and Mibitrans (exact analytical solution) models are recommended instead."
