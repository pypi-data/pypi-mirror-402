The visibility of carryover amounts in the report can be controlled at three
levels:

1.  **Company** (default for all partners): Go to *Settings > Invoicing >
    Japan Summary Invoice* and enable/disable **Show Carryover Amounts**.

2.  **Partner** (override for specific customers): Go to the partner form,
    under *Sales & Purchases > Summary Invoice*, set **Show Carryover Amounts**
    to:
    - *Use Company Default*: Follow the company setting
    - *Yes*: Always show carryover amounts
    - *No*: Never show carryover amounts

3.  **Billing** (per-billing override): In the billing form under the
    *Carryover* tab, the **Show Carryover Amounts** checkbox is computed
    from the partner setting but can be manually adjusted.
