class ServiceLifetime(Enum):
    """
    Defines the abstraction for service instance lifecycle management in the dependency injection container.

    This enumeration controls how and when service instances are created, cached, and disposed of
    throughout the application lifecycle, enabling proper resource management and performance optimization.

    Lifetime Patterns:
        - TRANSIENT: New instance every time (stateless services)
        - SCOPED: One instance per scope/request (request-specific state)
        - SINGLETON: One instance for entire application (shared state)

    Examples:
        ```python
        # Transient: New instance each time (e.g., calculators, validators)
        services.add_transient(EmailValidator)
        services.add_transient(PriceCalculator)

        # Scoped: One per HTTP request (e.g., repositories, unit of work)
        services.add_scoped(UserRepository)
        services.add_scoped(OrderRepository)

        # Singleton: One for entire app (e.g., configuration, cache)
        services.add_singleton(AppConfiguration)
        services.add_singleton(MemoryCache)
        ```

    Represents the abstraction for dependency injection containers that manage and provide service instances.

    This abstraction defines the core contract for dependency injection systems, enabling loose coupling,
    testability, and modular architecture by managing object creation and dependency resolution throughout
    the application lifecycle.

    Key Responsibilities:
        - Service instance creation and management
        - Dependency graph resolution and injection
        - Lifetime management (singleton, scoped, transient)
        - Service scope creation and disposal
        - Circular dependency detection and handling

    Examples:

        # Get optional service
        email_service = provider.get_service(EmailService)

            scoped_service = scope.get_service(RequestScopedService)

        ```

    Architecture:

class ServiceCollection(List[ServiceDescriptor]):
    """
    Represents a fluent configuration builder for dependency injection container services.

    The ServiceCollection provides a chainable API for registering services with different
    lifetimes and configuration options, making it easy to set up complex dependency graphs
    with minimal boilerplate code.

    Key Features:
        - Fluent registration API with method chaining
        - Support for all service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient)
        - Interface-to-implementation mappings
        - Factory-based service creation
        - Conditional registration with try_add methods
        - Automatic service provider building

    Examples:
        ```python
        # Basic service registration
        services = ServiceCollection()

        # Singleton services (shared across application)
        services.add_singleton(AppConfiguration) \\
                .add_singleton(ICache, MemoryCache) \\
                .add_singleton(ILogger, FileLogger)

        # Scoped services (one per request/scope)
        services.add_scoped(IUserRepository, SqlUserRepository) \\
                .add_scoped(IOrderRepository, SqlOrderRepository) \\
                .add_scoped(UnitOfWork)

        # Transient services (new instance each time)
        services.add_transient(IValidator, EmailValidator) \\
                .add_transient(IValidator, PasswordValidator) \\
                .add_transient(OrderService)

        # Factory-based registration
        services.add_singleton(
            IEmailService,
            implementation_factory=lambda p: SmtpEmailService(
                p.get_service(EmailConfiguration)
            )
        )

        # Conditional registration (only if not already registered)
        services.try_add_scoped(IUserRepository, InMemoryUserRepository)

        # Build the container
        provider = services.build_provider()
        ```

    Registration Patterns:
        ```python
        # Self-registration (concrete class as interface)
        services.add_scoped(UserService)

        # Interface mapping
        services.add_scoped(IUserService, UserService)

        # Multiple implementations
        services.add_transient(INotificationSender, EmailSender) \\
                .add_transient(INotificationSender, SmsSender)

        # Configuration-based factories
        services.add_singleton(
            DatabaseContext,
            implementation_factory=lambda p: DatabaseContext(
