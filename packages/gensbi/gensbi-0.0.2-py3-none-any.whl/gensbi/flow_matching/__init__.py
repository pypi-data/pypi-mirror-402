Flow Matching Models in GenSBI
-----------------------------

This package provides tools and modules for flow matching generative models, including path construction, solvers, and loss functions. The implementation is a derivative work of the Facebook Research Flow Matching library and is inspired by the foundational work of Lipman et al.:

* Y. Lipman et al. "Flow Matching for Generative Modeling." `arXiv:2210.02747 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747>`_
* Y. Lipman et al. "Flow Matching Guide and Code." `arXiv:2412.06264 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06264>`_
