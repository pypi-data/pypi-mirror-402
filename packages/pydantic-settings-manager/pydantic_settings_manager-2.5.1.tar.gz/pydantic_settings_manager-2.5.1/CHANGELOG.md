## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Type aliases for better type safety and code clarity:
  - `ModuleName`: Type alias for module name strings
  - `UserConfig`: Type alias for single configuration dictionaries
  - `UserConfigs`: Type alias for multiple configurations (multi-mode)
- Exported new type aliases from main package for public use

## [2.5.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
- **Configuration Aliases**: Multi-mode now supports aliases to reference the same configuration with different keys
  - Define aliases in `user_config` with `"aliases": {"dev": "development", ...}`
  - Supports multi-level aliases (alias of alias)
  - Circular reference detection with clear error messages
  - Useful for short names, service-specific keys, and migration scenarios
  - Works with both direct and structured configuration formats

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- `SettingsKey` type alias for better type safety and code clarity when working with configuration keys

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Python version upgraded from 3.9 to 3.12
- Modernized codebase to use Python 3.12+ syntax (PEP 695):
  - `type` keyword for type aliases
  - Type parameter syntax for generic classes
- Updated CI to test only Python 3.12 and 3.13
- Updated mypy and ruff target versions to py312

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Dropped support for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Removed `typing_extensions` dependency (no longer needed with Python 3.12+)

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- `get_settings()` now treats empty string `""` as `None`, returning current active settings instead of raising an error

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- **Bootstrap Pattern**: New `load_user_configs()` helper function for centralized configuration loading across multiple modules
- **Deep Merge Utility**: Exported `update_dict()` function for deep merging of nested configuration dictionaries
- **New Method**: `get_settings(key: str | None = None)` - More intuitive method for getting settings by key or current active settings
- Comprehensive documentation for Bootstrap Pattern with recommended implementation examples
- FAQ section covering common Bootstrap Pattern questions
- Project structure examples for multi-module applications
- Support for custom manager names in `load_user_configs()` (defaults to `settings_manager`)

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Major README restructure with improved organization and Table of Contents
- Enhanced Bootstrap Pattern section with production-ready examples
- Improved configuration file structure documentation with YAML examples
- Better separation between simple single-module and complex multi-module use cases

### Deprecated
- `get_settings_by_key(key: str | None)` - Use `get_settings(key)` instead (will be removed in v3.0.0)

### Removed
- Removed "Complex Settings with Nested Configuration" section from README (Pydantic-specific, not package-specific)

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- **Direct Configuration Format**: Multi-mode now supports direct configuration format `{"dev": {...}, "prod": {...}}` in addition to the existing structured format `{"key": "dev", "map": {...}}`
- Enhanced flexibility for multi-configuration setup with more intuitive API

### Changed
- `SettingsManager.user_config` setter in multi-mode now automatically detects configuration format
- Improved configuration format detection logic for better reliability
- Updated documentation and examples to showcase both configuration formats

### Fixed
- Simplified condition logic in configuration format detection
- Enhanced test coverage for both direct and structured configuration formats

## [2.1.0] - 2025-9-04

### Changed
- **API Enhancement**: `SettingsManager.get_settings_by_key()` now accepts `str | None` instead of just `str`
- When `None` is passed to `get_settings_by_key()`, it returns the current active settings (same behavior as empty string)
- Improved API consistency and flexibility for multi-mode configuration access

### Added
- Enhanced type annotations for better IDE support and type safety
- Additional test coverage for `None` parameter handling

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-04

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated classes as announced in v1.0.0:
  - `BaseSettingsManager`: Use `SettingsManager` instead
  - `SingleSettingsManager`: Use `SettingsManager(MySettings)` instead
  - `MappedSettingsManager`: Use `SettingsManager(MySettings, multi=True)` instead
- Removed internal implementation files: `base.py`, `single.py`, `mapped.py`, `deprecated.py`, `types.py`
- Removed `nested_dict` utility function (was only used by deprecated `SingleSettingsManager`)

### Changed
- Simplified package structure with only the unified `SettingsManager` class
- Reduced package size by removing deprecated code paths
- Cleaner API surface with only the recommended `SettingsManager` class

### Migration
- All functionality is available through the unified `SettingsManager` class
- No breaking changes for users already using `SettingsManager`
- See migration guide in README for upgrading from deprecated classes

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- Fixed `get_settings_by_key` method to properly validate single mode usage
- Added proper error handling when `get_settings_by_key` is called in single mode
- Improved docstring for `get_settings_by_key` to clarify multi-mode requirement and empty key behavior
- Enhanced API consistency by restricting multi-mode specific methods to multi-mode only

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `BaseSettingsManager`, `SingleSettingsManager`, and `MappedSettingsManager` are now deprecated

- **BREAKING**: Multi-mode configuration no longer requires `"map"` wrapper
- Improved internal implementation with consistent map-based approach
- Enhanced type safety with better generic type handling
- Simplified API with property-based operations
