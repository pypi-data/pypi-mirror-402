Released in 2025, GENOVIS is a visualization toolkit for population genomic analyses.
It supports the generation of: Manhattan plots, three-dimensional PCA, SNP density maps,
admixture plots, runs of homozygosity (ROH) intervals, and relationship matrices.

- ***v1.0.5 (2026-01-22)*** – add clarification :
  - GENOVIS is an independent academic open-source software and is not affiliated with 
	any commercial entity or similarly named tools.

- ***v1.0.4 (2025-12-07)*** – Fixed a bug in the `genovis-gui` :
  - in line 2773 self.pushButton_3dpca_RUN.setText(_translate("GENOVIS_GUI", "Run 3dpca"))
	**cganged to**
	self.pushButton_3dpca_RUN.setText(_translate("GENOVIS_GUI", "Run pca3d"))

- ***v1.0.3 (2025-12-02)*** – Fixed a bug in the `rohpainter` module:
  - For defining font size of legend title:
	ax.legend(handles,pops,title='Population',loc='upper left',bbox_to_anchor=(1.02, 1.0),borderaxespad=0.)
	**changed to**
	ax.legend(handles,pops,title='Population',loc='upper left',title_fontsize=args.fs+1,bbox_to_anchor=(1.02, 1.0),borderaxespad=0.)


- ***v1.0.2 (2025-12-01)*** – Fixed a bug in the `rohpainter` module:
  - For defining font sizes:
	mpl.rcParams['axes.titlesize']= args.fs
    mpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize']= args.fs
    mpl.rcParams['legend.fontsize']= args.fs
	**were added to**
	rohpainter.py


- ***v1.0.1 (2025-11-21)*** – Fixed a bug in the `mapden` module:
  - Force chromosome IDs to be read as strings to avoid issues with mixed/leading-zero chromosome labels:
	df=pd.read_csv(args.m,names=cols,sep=r'\s+') **changed to** df=pd.read_csv(args.m,names=cols,sep=r'\s+',dtype={'Chr': str})
	genome_index=pd.read_csv(args.i,sep=r'\s+',header=None,names=['Chr','Size']) **changed to** genome_index=pd.read_csv(args.i,sep=r'\s+',header=None,names=['Chr','Size'],dtype={'Chr': str})
  - Sort chromosome IDs based on the order of chromosome IDs in index file:
	chromosomes = set(df["Chr"].unique()) 
	**changed to**
	chrs_in_map = set(df["Chr"].unique())
    chromosomes = [c for c in genome_index["Chr"] if c in chrs_in_map]
