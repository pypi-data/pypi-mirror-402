    This service directly communicates with the various Payment Service Providers (PSPs)   in order to charge or refund customers. This service will automatically connect to the PSP linked   in your admin configuration; meaning if you configured Stripe, it will automatically create a payment   on Stripe when you create it in Emil.  # noqa: E501
