              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          id_engine: Identifier of the parent engine record.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          burn_time: Launch engine maximum burn time in seconds.

          chamber_pressure: Engine chamber pressure in bars.

          characteristic_type: Engine characteristic type (e.g. Electric, Mono-propellant, Bi-propellant,
              etc.).

          cycle_type: Engine cycle type (e.g. Electrostatic Ion, Pressure Fed, Hall, Catalytic
              Decomposition, etc.).

          family: Engine type or family.

          manufacturer_org_id: Organization ID of the engine manufacturer.

          nozzle_expansion_ratio: Engine nozzle expansion ratio.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          oxidizer: Oxidizer type (e.g. Nitrogen Tetroxide, Liquid Oxygen, etc).

          propellant: Propellant/fuel type of the engine (e.g. Liquid Hydrogen, Kerosene, Aerozine,
