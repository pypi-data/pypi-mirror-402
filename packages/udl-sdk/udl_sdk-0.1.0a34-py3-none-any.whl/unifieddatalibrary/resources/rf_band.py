              details and descriptions of each band name.

          bandwidth: RF Band frequency range bandwidth in megahertz.

          bandwidth_settings: Array of frequency range bandwidth settings, in megahertz for this RFBand. If
              this array is specified then it must be the same size as the frequencySettings
              array. A null value may be used for one or more of the frequencies in the

              frequency.

              degrees.

          beamwidth_settings: Array of beamwidth settings, in degrees for this RFBand. If this array is

              antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the
              transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave
              dipole. Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a

          name: RF Band name.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          band: Name of the band of this RF range (e.g.
              X,K,Ku,Ka,L,S,C,UHF,VHF,EHF,SHF,UNK,VLF,HF,E,Q,V,W). See RFBandType for more
              details and descriptions of each band name.

          bandwidth: RF Band frequency range bandwidth in megahertz.

          bandwidth_settings: Array of frequency range bandwidth settings, in megahertz for this RFBand. If
              this array is specified then it must be the same size as the frequencySettings

              value may be used for one or more of the frequencies in the frequencySettings

              then it must be the same size as the frequencySettings array. A null value may
              be used for one or more of the frequencies in the frequencySettings array if
              there is no corresponding value for a given frequency.

          edge_gain: RF Range edge gain, in decibel relative to isotrope.

          eirp: EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in decibel watts required to a lossless
              half-wave dipole antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the
              antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the
              transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave
              dipole. Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both
              measure the amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of
              electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of
              maximum signal strength (the main lobe) of its radiation pattern.

          erp: Effective Radiated Power (ERP) is the total power in decibel watts radiated by
              an actual antenna relative to a half-wave dipole rather than a theoretical
              isotropic antenna. A half-wave dipole has a gain of 2.15 dB compared to an
              isotropic antenna. EIRP(dB) = ERP (dB)+2.15 dB or EIRP (W) = 1.64\\**ERP(W).
              Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the
              amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of
              electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of
              maximum signal strength (the main lobe) of its radiation pattern.

              datasets.

          id_entity: Unique identifier of the parent Entity which uses this band.

          name: RF Band name.

          source: Source of the data.

          body_id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          band: Name of the band of this RF range (e.g.
              X,K,Ku,Ka,L,S,C,UHF,VHF,EHF,SHF,UNK,VLF,HF,E,Q,V,W). See RFBandType for more
              details and descriptions of each band name.

          bandwidth: RF Band frequency range bandwidth in megahertz.

          bandwidth_settings: Array of frequency range bandwidth settings, in megahertz for this RFBand. If
              this array is specified then it must be the same size as the frequencySettings
              array. A null value may be used for one or more of the frequencies in the

              frequency.

          beamwidth: Angle between the half-power (-3 dB) points of the main lobe of the antenna, in
              degrees.

          beamwidth_settings: Array of beamwidth settings, in degrees for this RFBand. If this array is
              specified then it must be the same size as the frequencySettings array. A null
              value may be used for one or more of the frequencies in the frequencySettings

          edge_gain: RF Range edge gain, in decibel relative to isotrope.

          eirp: EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in decibel watts required to a lossless
              half-wave dipole antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the
              antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the
              transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave
              dipole. Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both
              measure the amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of
              electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of
              maximum signal strength (the main lobe) of its radiation pattern.

          erp: Effective Radiated Power (ERP) is the total power in decibel watts radiated by
              an actual antenna relative to a half-wave dipole rather than a theoretical
              isotropic antenna. A half-wave dipole has a gain of 2.15 dB compared to an
              isotropic antenna. EIRP(dB) = ERP (dB)+2.15 dB or EIRP (W) = 1.64\\**ERP(W).
              Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the
              amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of
              electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of
              maximum signal strength (the main lobe) of its radiation pattern.

              value may be used for one or more of the frequencies in the frequencySettings
              array if there is no corresponding value for a given frequency.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from

              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
