        Service operation to dynamically query data and only return specified
        columns/fields. Requested columns are specified by the 'columns' query parameter
        and should be a comma separated list of valid fields for the specified data
        type. classificationMarking is always returned. See the queryhelp operation
        (/udl/<datatype>/queryhelp) for more details on valid/required query parameter
        information. An example URI: /udl/elset/tuple?columns=satNo,period&epoch=>now-5
        hours would return the satNo and period of elsets with an epoch greater than 5
        hours ago.

        Args:
          columns: Comma-separated list of valid field names for this data type to be returned in
              the response. Only the fields specified will be returned as well as the
              classification marking of the data, if applicable. See the ‘queryhelp’ operation
              for a complete list of possible fields.
