          location_start: Starting location of the vehicle.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          avg_duration: Average travel duration for the indicated distance and type of vehicle in hours.

          avg_speed: Average speed during travel in the indicated unit of measurement, speedUnit.

          data_pts_used: The number of data points used in this travel duration calculation.

          distance: Distance between the departure and arrival locations in the indicated unit of
              measurement, distUnit.

          dist_unit: The unit of measurement used for distance in this calculation.

              ideal travel route.
