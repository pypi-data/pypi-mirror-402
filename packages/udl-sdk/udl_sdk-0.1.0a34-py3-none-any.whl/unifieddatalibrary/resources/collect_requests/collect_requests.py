          elset: An element set is a collection of Keplerian orbital elements describing an orbit
              of a particular satellite. The data is used along with an orbit propagator in
              order to predict the motion of a satellite. The element set, or elset for short,
              consists of identification data, the classical elements and drag parameters.

              request. If both idSensor and origSensorId are null then the request is assumed

          orient_angle: The magnitude of rotation, in degrees, between the xAngle direction and locally

              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by the data source to indicate the target object of

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the source to indicate the sensor identifier
              requested/scheduled/planned for this request. This may be an internal identifier
              and not necessarily a valid sensor ID. If both idSensor and origSensorId are
              null then the request is assumed to be a general request for observations or
              contact on an object, if specified, or an area/volume. In this case, the
              requester may specify a desired obType.

          sat_no: Satellite/catalog number of the target on-orbit object for this request.

          scenario: Pre-coordinated code, direction, or configuration to be executed by the sensor
              or site for this collect or contact.

          semi_major_axis: The average of the periapsis and apoapsis distances, in kilometers. For circular

          srch_inc: The maximum inclination, in degrees, to be used in search operations.

          srch_pattern: The search pattern to be executed for this request (e.g. PICKET-FENCE, SCAN,
              etc.).

          state_vector: This service provides operations for querying and manipulation of state vectors
              for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and
              velocity (v) that, together with their time (epoch) (t), uniquely determine the
              trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see

              if a (starting) lat value is provided.

          stop_lon: The stopping WGS-84 longitude of a volume definition, in degrees. -180 to 180
              degrees (negative values west of Prime Meridian). The stopLon value is only
              meaningful if a (starting) lon value is provided.

          suffix: The (SSN) tasking suffix (A-Z) associated with this request. The suffix defines
              the amount of observational data and the frequency of collection. Note that
              suffix definitions are sensor type specific.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          target_size: The minimum object (diameter) size, in meters, to be reported.

              observational data. Note that category definitions are sensor type specific.

          task_group: The tasking group to which the target object is assigned.

          task_id: Task ID associated with this request. A task ID may be associated with a single
              collect request or may be used to tie together the sub-requests of a full
              collect, for example a DWELL consisting of many dwell points.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          true_anomoly: The true anomaly defines the angular position, in degrees, of the object on it's
              orbital path as measured from the orbit focal point at epoch. The true anomaly
              is referenced from perigee.

          uct_follow_up: Boolean indicating that this collect request is UCT follow-up.

          vis_mag_max: The maximum estimated or expected visual magnitude of the target, in Magnitudes
              (M).

          vis_mag_min: The minimum estimated or expected visual magnitude of the target, in Magnitudes
              (M). If only minimum vismag is provided it is assumed to be minimum reportable
              vismag.

          x_angle: The angular distance, in degrees, in the sensor-x direction from scan center
              defined by the central vector. The specification of xAngle and yAngle defines a

              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by the data source to indicate the target object of

          state_vector: This service provides operations for querying and manipulation of state vectors
              for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and
              velocity (v) that, together with their time (epoch) (t), uniquely determine the
              trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see

          stop_lon: The stopping WGS-84 longitude of a volume definition, in degrees. -180 to 180
              degrees (negative values west of Prime Meridian). The stopLon value is only
              meaningful if a (starting) lon value is provided.

          suffix: The (SSN) tasking suffix (A-Z) associated with this request. The suffix defines
              the amount of observational data and the frequency of collection. Note that

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null

          task_group: The tasking group to which the target object is assigned.

          task_id: Task ID associated with this request. A task ID may be associated with a single
              collect request or may be used to tie together the sub-requests of a full
              collect, for example a DWELL consisting of many dwell points.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          true_anomoly: The true anomaly defines the angular position, in degrees, of the object on it's
              orbital path as measured from the orbit focal point at epoch. The true anomaly
              is referenced from perigee.

          vis_mag_min: The minimum estimated or expected visual magnitude of the target, in Magnitudes
