          lon: WGS84 longitude of the drop zone, in degrees. -180 to 180 degrees (negative
              values west of Prime Meridian).

          name: The name of the drop zone.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          alt_country_code: Specifies an alternate country code for the drop zone if the data provider code
              is not part of an official Country Code standard such as ISO-3166 or FIPS. This

          code: The type code for the drop zone.

          country_code: The Country Code where the drop zone is located. This value is typically the ISO
              3166 Alpha-2 two-character country code, however it can also represent various
