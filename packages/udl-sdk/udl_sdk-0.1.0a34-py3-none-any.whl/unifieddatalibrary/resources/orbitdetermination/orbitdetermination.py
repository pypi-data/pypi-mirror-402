              precision.

          initial_od: Flag indicating whether this is an initial orbit determination.

          method: Orbit determination method used to produce this record (e.g. BLS, KF, UKF,
              etc.).

          source: Source of the data.

          start_time: Start time for OD solution in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format, with microsecond
              precision.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          accepted_ob_ids: Array of UDL data (observation) UUIDs that were accepted in this OD solution.
              See the associated acceptedObTyps array for the specific types of observations
              for the positionally corresponding UUIDs in this array (the two arrays must
              match in size).

          accepted_ob_typs: Array of UDL observation types (e.g. DOA, EO, RADAR, RF) of the observations
              that were accepted in this OD solution. See the associated acceptedObIds array
              for the records UUID(s), positionally corresponding to the record types in this
              array. The acceptedObTyps and acceptedObIds arrays must match in size.

          agom_est: Flag indicating whether the AGOM was estimated during this OD solution.

          agom_model: Model used to estimate the AGOM.

          apriori_elset: An element set is a collection of Keplerian orbital elements describing an orbit
              of a particular satellite. The data is used along with an orbit propagator in
              order to predict the motion of a satellite. The element set, or elset for short,
              consists of identification data, the classical elements and drag parameters.

          apriori_id_elset: Identifier of the element set used to seed this OD solution. This ID can be used
              to obtain additional information on an Elset object using the 'get by ID'
              operation (e.g. /udl/elset/{id}). For example, the Elset with idElset = abc
              would be queried as /udl/elset/abc.

          apriori_id_state_vector: Identifier of the state vector used to seed this OD solution. This ID can be
              used to obtain additional information on a StateVector object using the 'get by
              ID' operation (e.g. /udl/statevector/{id}). For example, the StateVector with
              idStateVector = abc would be queried as /udl/statevector/abc.

          apriori_state_vector: This service provides operations for querying and manipulation of state vectors
              for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and
              velocity (v) that, together with their time (epoch) (t), uniquely determine the
              trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see
              the 'Discover' tab in the storefront to confirm coordinate frames by data
              provider.

          ballistic_coeff_est: Flag indicating whether the ballistic coefficient was estimated during this OD
              solution.

          best_pass_wrms: Lowest Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) value achieved for any single satellite
              pass during the observation span, indicating the pass with the highest quality
              OD solution.

          edr: Model parameter value for energy dissipation rate (EDR) in watts per kilogram.

          effective_from: Optional start time at which this OD solution is accurate, in ISO 8601 UTC

              8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision.

          error_growth_rate: Error growth rate of the OD solution in kilometers per day.

          first_pass_wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) calculated for the first satellite pass in
              the observation span. Serves as the initial quality metric for the beginning of
              the observation period.

          fit_span: The fit span, in days, used in a Batch Least Squares (BLS) OD.

          last_ob_end: The end of the time interval containing the time of the last accepted
              observation, in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision. For an
              exact observation time, the lastObStart and lastObEnd are the same.

          last_ob_start: The start of the time interval containing the time of the last accepted
              observation, in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision. For an

          method_source: Source of orbit determination method used to produce this record (e.g. ASW,
              ACTRAC, FreeFlyer, GEODYNE, GDTS, etc.).

          num_iterations: The number of iterations taken for the algorithm to converge on an OD solution.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by the OD source to indicate the target on-orbit
              object of this OD solution. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily map to a valid satellite number.

          previous_wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) of the differential correction from the
              previous overhead pass of the satellite. Provides a point of comparison for
              assessing changes in the quality of the OD solution between consecutive passes.

          rejected_ob_ids: Array of UDL data (observation) UUIDs that were rejected in this OD solution.
              See the associated rejectedObTyps array for the specific types of observations

              match in size).

          rejected_ob_typs: Array of UDL observation types (e.g. DOA, EO, RADAR, RF) of the observations
              that were rejected in this OD solution. See the associated rejectedObIds array
              for the records UUID(s), positionally corresponding to the record types in this
              array. The rejectedObTyps and rejectedObIds arrays must match in size.

          rms_convergence_criteria: OD parameter value for the Root Mean Square (RMS) convergence criteria to
              successfully close the OD solution.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          sensor_ids: Array of UDL UUIDs (idSensor) of the sensors that contributed observations in
              this OD solution.

          time_span: The time span used for the OD of the object, in days.

          wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) of the differential correction of the
              target object that produced this OD state. WRMS is a quality indicator of the OD
              update, with a value of 1.00 being optimal. WRMS applies to batch least squares
              (BLS) processes.

              datasets.

          end_time: End time for OD solution in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format, with microsecond
              precision.

          initial_od: Flag indicating whether this is an initial orbit determination.

          method: Orbit determination method used to produce this record (e.g. BLS, KF, UKF,
              etc.).

          source: Source of the data.

          start_time: Start time for OD solution in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format, with microsecond
              precision.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          accepted_ob_ids: Array of UDL data (observation) UUIDs that were accepted in this OD solution.
              See the associated acceptedObTyps array for the specific types of observations
              for the positionally corresponding UUIDs in this array (the two arrays must

              that were accepted in this OD solution. See the associated acceptedObIds array
              for the records UUID(s), positionally corresponding to the record types in this
              array. The acceptedObTyps and acceptedObIds arrays must match in size.

          agom_est: Flag indicating whether the AGOM was estimated during this OD solution.

          agom_model: Model used to estimate the AGOM.

          apriori_elset: An element set is a collection of Keplerian orbital elements describing an orbit
              of a particular satellite. The data is used along with an orbit propagator in
              order to predict the motion of a satellite. The element set, or elset for short,
              consists of identification data, the classical elements and drag parameters.

          apriori_id_elset: Identifier of the element set used to seed this OD solution. This ID can be used
              to obtain additional information on an Elset object using the 'get by ID'
              operation (e.g. /udl/elset/{id}). For example, the Elset with idElset = abc
              would be queried as /udl/elset/abc.

          apriori_id_state_vector: Identifier of the state vector used to seed this OD solution. This ID can be
              used to obtain additional information on a StateVector object using the 'get by
              ID' operation (e.g. /udl/statevector/{id}). For example, the StateVector with
              idStateVector = abc would be queried as /udl/statevector/abc.

          apriori_state_vector: This service provides operations for querying and manipulation of state vectors
              for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and
              velocity (v) that, together with their time (epoch) (t), uniquely determine the
              trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see
              the 'Discover' tab in the storefront to confirm coordinate frames by data
              provider.

          ballistic_coeff_est: Flag indicating whether the ballistic coefficient was estimated during this OD
              solution.

          ballistic_coeff_model: Model used to estimate the ballistic coefficient.

          best_pass_wrms: Lowest Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) value achieved for any single satellite
              pass during the observation span, indicating the pass with the highest quality
              OD solution.

          edr: Model parameter value for energy dissipation rate (EDR) in watts per kilogram.

          effective_from: Optional start time at which this OD solution is accurate, in ISO 8601 UTC
              datetime format with microsecond precision.

          effective_until: Optional end time at which this OD solution may no longer be accurate, in ISO
              8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision.

          error_growth_rate: Error growth rate of the OD solution in kilometers per day.

          first_pass_wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) calculated for the first satellite pass in
              the observation span. Serves as the initial quality metric for the beginning of
              the observation period.

          fit_span: The fit span, in days, used in a Batch Least Squares (BLS) OD.

          last_ob_end: The end of the time interval containing the time of the last accepted
              observation, in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision. For an
              exact observation time, the lastObStart and lastObEnd are the same.

          last_ob_start: The start of the time interval containing the time of the last accepted
              observation, in ISO 8601 UTC datetime format with microsecond precision. For an
              exact observation time, the lastObStart and lastObEnd are the same.

          method_source: Source of orbit determination method used to produce this record (e.g. ASW,
              ACTRAC, FreeFlyer, GEODYNE, GDTS, etc.).

          num_iterations: The number of iterations taken for the algorithm to converge on an OD solution.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by the OD source to indicate the target on-orbit
              object of this OD solution. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily map to a valid satellite number.

          previous_wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) of the differential correction from the
              previous overhead pass of the satellite. Provides a point of comparison for
              assessing changes in the quality of the OD solution between consecutive passes.

          rejected_ob_ids: Array of UDL data (observation) UUIDs that were rejected in this OD solution.
              See the associated rejectedObTyps array for the specific types of observations
              for the positionally corresponding UUIDs in this array (the two arrays must
              match in size).

          rejected_ob_typs: Array of UDL observation types (e.g. DOA, EO, RADAR, RF) of the observations
              that were rejected in this OD solution. See the associated rejectedObIds array
              for the records UUID(s), positionally corresponding to the record types in this
              array. The rejectedObTyps and rejectedObIds arrays must match in size.

          rms_convergence_criteria: OD parameter value for the Root Mean Square (RMS) convergence criteria to
              successfully close the OD solution.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          sensor_ids: Array of UDL UUIDs (idSensor) of the sensors that contributed observations in
              this OD solution.

          time_span: The time span used for the OD of the object, in days.

          wrms: The Weighted Root Mean Squared (RMS) of the differential correction of the
              target object that produced this OD state. WRMS is a quality indicator of the OD
              update, with a value of 1.00 being optimal. WRMS applies to batch least squares
              (BLS) processes.
