              equivalent field is not converted by the UDL and may or may not be supplied by
              the provider. The provider/consumer is responsible for all unit conversions.

          elev_m: Elevation of the airfield above mean sea level, in meters. Note: The
              corresponding equivalent field is not converted by the UDL and may or may not be
