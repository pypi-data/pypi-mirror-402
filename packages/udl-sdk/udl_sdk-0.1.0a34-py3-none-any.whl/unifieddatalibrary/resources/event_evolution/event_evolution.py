        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          event_id: User-provided unique identifier of this activity or event. This ID should remain
              the same on subsequent updates in order to associate all records pertaining to
              the activity or event.

          source: Source of the data.

          start_time: The actual or estimated start time of the activity or event, in ISO 8601 UTC
              format.

          summary: Summary or description of the activity or event.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          agjson: Geographical region or polygon (lat/lon pairs), as depicted by the GeoJSON
              representation of the geometry/geography, of the image as projected on the
              ground. GeoJSON Reference: https://geojson.org/. Ignored if included with a POST
              or PUT request that also specifies a valid 'area' or 'atext' field.

          andims: Number of dimensions of the geometry depicted by region.

          area: Optional geographical region or polygon (lat/lon pairs) of the area surrounding
              the point of interest as projected on the ground.

          asrid: Geographical spatial_ref_sys for region.

          atext: Geographical region or polygon (lon/lat pairs), as depicted by the Well-Known
              Text representation of the geometry/geography, of the image as projected on the
              ground. WKT reference: https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wkt-crs. Ignored
              if included with a POST or PUT request that also specifies a valid 'area' field.

          atype: Type of region as projected on the ground.

          category: The activity or event type associated with this record (e.g. BREAKUP, DIRECT
              FIRE, IED, LAUNCH, PROTEST, etc.). For Significant Activities, recommended but
              not constrained to, CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3 Chapter 6. Note that the evolution of an
              event may incorporate records of various types, for example, a LAUNCH event may
              evolve into a BREAKUP event.

          country_code: The country code. This value is typically the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 two-character
              country code, however it can also represent various consortiums that do not
              appear in the ISO document. The code must correspond to an existing country in
              the UDL’s country API. Call udl/country/{code} to get any associated FIPS code,
              ISO Alpha-3 code, or alternate code values that exist for the specified country
              code.

          data_description: Optional description of the relationship between the records provided in the
              srcTyps/srcIds and the activity or event.

          end_time: The actual or estimated start time of the activity or event, in ISO 8601 UTC
              format.

          geo_admin_level1: Administrative boundaries of the first sub-national level. Level 1 is simply the
              largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been determined by
              the governing body. For example this may be the state/province in which a
              terrestrial event takes place, or with which the event is attributed for
              non-localized or non-terrestrial activity.

          geo_admin_level2: Administrative boundaries of the second sub-national level. Level 2 is simply
              the second largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been
              determined by the governing body. For example this may be the city/district in
              which a terrestrial event takes place, or with which the event is attributed for
              non-localized or non-terrestrial activity.

          geo_admin_level3: Administrative boundaries of the third sub-national level. Level 3 is simply the
              third largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been
              determined by the governing body.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          redact: Flag indicating that this record is for the purpose of redacting one or more
              previously specified records from association with this activity or event. If
              this flag is set then all records indicated in srcTyps/srcIds should be removed
              from event association.

          src_ids: Array of UUIDs of the UDL data records that are related to the determination of
              this activity or event. See the associated 'srcTyps' array for the specific
              types of data, positionally corresponding to the UUIDs in this array. The
              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size. See the corresponding srcTyps
              array element for the data type of the UUID and use the appropriate API
              operation to retrieve that object.

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types (AIS, CONJUNCTION, DOA, ELSET, EO, ESID, GROUNDIMAGE,
              POI, MANEUVER, MTI, NOTIFICATION, RADAR, RF, SIGACT, SKYIMAGE, SV, TRACK) that
              are related to this activity or event. See the associated 'srcIds' array for the
              record UUIDs, positionally corresponding to the record types in this array. The
              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size.

          status: The status of this activity or event. (ACTIVE, CONCLUDED, UNKNOWN).

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          url: List of URLs to before/after images of this point of interest entity.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          agjson: Geographical region or polygon (lat/lon pairs), as depicted by the GeoJSON
              representation of the geometry/geography, of the image as projected on the
              ground. GeoJSON Reference: https://geojson.org/. Ignored if included with a POST
              or PUT request that also specifies a valid 'area' or 'atext' field.

          andims: Number of dimensions of the geometry depicted by region.

          area: Optional geographical region or polygon (lat/lon pairs) of the area surrounding
              the point of interest as projected on the ground.

          asrid: Geographical spatial_ref_sys for region.

          atext: Geographical region or polygon (lon/lat pairs), as depicted by the Well-Known
              Text representation of the geometry/geography, of the image as projected on the

              if included with a POST or PUT request that also specifies a valid 'area' field.

          atype: Type of region as projected on the ground.

          category: The activity or event type associated with this record (e.g. BREAKUP, DIRECT
              FIRE, IED, LAUNCH, PROTEST, etc.). For Significant Activities, recommended but
              not constrained to, CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3 Chapter 6. Note that the evolution of an
              event may incorporate records of various types, for example, a LAUNCH event may
              evolve into a BREAKUP event.

          country_code: The country code. This value is typically the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 two-character
              country code, however it can also represent various consortiums that do not
              appear in the ISO document. The code must correspond to an existing country in
              the UDL’s country API. Call udl/country/{code} to get any associated FIPS code,
              ISO Alpha-3 code, or alternate code values that exist for the specified country
              code.

          data_description: Optional description of the relationship between the records provided in the
              srcTyps/srcIds and the activity or event.

          end_time: The actual or estimated start time of the activity or event, in ISO 8601 UTC
              format.

          geo_admin_level1: Administrative boundaries of the first sub-national level. Level 1 is simply the
              largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been determined by
              the governing body. For example this may be the state/province in which a
              terrestrial event takes place, or with which the event is attributed for
              non-localized or non-terrestrial activity.

          geo_admin_level2: Administrative boundaries of the second sub-national level. Level 2 is simply
              the second largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been
              determined by the governing body. For example this may be the city/district in
              which a terrestrial event takes place, or with which the event is attributed for
              non-localized or non-terrestrial activity.

          geo_admin_level3: Administrative boundaries of the third sub-national level. Level 3 is simply the
              third largest demarcation under whatever demarcation criteria has been
              determined by the governing body.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          redact: Flag indicating that this record is for the purpose of redacting one or more
              previously specified records from association with this activity or event. If
              this flag is set then all records indicated in srcTyps/srcIds should be removed
              from event association.

          src_ids: Array of UUIDs of the UDL data records that are related to the determination of
              this activity or event. See the associated 'srcTyps' array for the specific
              types of data, positionally corresponding to the UUIDs in this array. The
              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size. See the corresponding srcTyps
              array element for the data type of the UUID and use the appropriate API
              operation to retrieve that object.

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types (AIS, CONJUNCTION, DOA, ELSET, EO, ESID, GROUNDIMAGE,
              POI, MANEUVER, MTI, NOTIFICATION, RADAR, RF, SIGACT, SKYIMAGE, SV, TRACK) that
              are related to this activity or event. See the associated 'srcIds' array for the
              record UUIDs, positionally corresponding to the record types in this array. The
              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size.

          status: The status of this activity or event. (ACTIVE, CONCLUDED, UNKNOWN).

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          url: List of URLs to before/after images of this point of interest entity.
