          feature_array: An array of numeric feature/assessment values expressed in the specified unit of
              measure (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data

              string observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value

              (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_string: A single feature/assessment string expressed in the specified unit of measure
              (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data types, each
              record may employ a numeric observation value (featureValue), a string
              observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value (featureBool), an
              array of numeric observation values (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_string_array: An array of string feature/assessment expressions. Because of the variability of
              the Feature Assessment data types, each record may employ a numeric observation

              observation value (featureBool), an array of numeric observation values
              (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_value: A single feature/assessment value expressed in the specified unit of measure
              (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data types, each

              observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value (featureBool), an
              array of numeric observation values (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          speed: Feature's speed of travel, in meters per second.

          src_ids: Array of UUIDs of the UDL data records that are related to the determination of
              this activity or event. See the associated 'srcTyps' array for the specific
              types of data, positionally corresponding to the UUIDs in this array. The
              'srcTyps', 'srcIds', and 'srcTs' arrays must contain the same number of
              elements. See the corresponding srcTyps array element for the data type of the
              UUID and use the appropriate API operation to retrieve that object.

          src_ts: Array of the primary timestamps, in ISO 8601 UTC format, with appropriate
              precision for the datatype of each correspondng srcTyp/srcId record. See the

              'srcTyps', 'srcIds', and 'srcTs' arrays must contain the same number of
              elements. These timestamps are included to support services which do not include
              a GET by {id} operation. If referencing a datatype which does not include a
              primary timestamp, the corresponding srcTs array element should be included as
              null.

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types (AIS, GROUNDIMAGE, MTI, ONORBIT, POI, SAR, SKYIMAGE,
              SOI, TRACK) related to this feature assessment. See the associated 'srcIds' and
              'srcTs' arrays for the record UUIDs and timetsmps. respectively, positionally
              corresponding to the record types in this array. The 'srcTyps', 'srcIds', and
              'srcTs' arrays must contain the same number of elements.

              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

              produce this data.

          type: The type of feature (e.g. AIRCRAFT, ANTENNA, SOLAR ARRAY, SITE, STRUCTURE,
              VESSEL, VEHICLE, UNKNOWN, etc.) detailed in this feature assessment record. This
              type may be a primary feature within an image, for example a VESSEL, or may be a
              component or characteristic of a primary feature, for example an ANTENNA mounted
              on a vessel.

          width: Estimated physical width of the feature, in meters.

          confidence: Analytic confidence of feature accuracy (0 to 1).

          external_id: Feature Assessment ID from external systems. This field has no meaning within
              UDL and is provided as a convenience for systems that require tracking of an
              internal system generated ID.

          feature_array: An array of numeric feature/assessment values expressed in the specified unit of
              measure (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data
              types, each record may employ a numeric observation value (featureValue), a
              string observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value
              (featureBool), an array of numeric observation values (featureArray), or any
              combination of these.

          feature_bool: A boolean feature/assessment. Because of the variability of the Feature
              Assessment data types, each record may employ a numeric observation value
              (featureValue), a string observation value (featureString), a Boolean
              observation value (featureBool), an array of numeric observation values
              (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_string: A single feature/assessment string expressed in the specified unit of measure
              (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data types, each
              record may employ a numeric observation value (featureValue), a string
              observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value (featureBool), an
              array of numeric observation values (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_string_array: An array of string feature/assessment expressions. Because of the variability of
              the Feature Assessment data types, each record may employ a numeric observation
              value (featureValue), a string observation value (featureString), a Boolean
              observation value (featureBool), an array of numeric observation values
              (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          feature_value: A single feature/assessment value expressed in the specified unit of measure
              (obUoM). Because of the variability of the Feature Assessment data types, each
              record may employ a numeric observation value (featureValue), a string
              observation value (featureString), a Boolean observation value (featureBool), an
              array of numeric observation values (featureArray), or any combination of these.

          heading: The feature object heading, in degrees clockwise from true North at the object
              location.

          height: Estimated physical height of the feature, in meters.

          length: Estimated physical length of the feature, in meters.

          name: Source defined name of the feature associated with this record. If an annotation
              for this feature element exists on the parent image it can be referenced here.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          speed: Feature's speed of travel, in meters per second.

          src_ids: Array of UUIDs of the UDL data records that are related to the determination of
              this activity or event. See the associated 'srcTyps' array for the specific
              types of data, positionally corresponding to the UUIDs in this array. The
              'srcTyps', 'srcIds', and 'srcTs' arrays must contain the same number of
              elements. See the corresponding srcTyps array element for the data type of the
              UUID and use the appropriate API operation to retrieve that object.

          src_ts: Array of the primary timestamps, in ISO 8601 UTC format, with appropriate
              precision for the datatype of each correspondng srcTyp/srcId record. See the
              associated 'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays for the record type and UUID,
              respectively, positionally corresponding to the record types in this array. The
              'srcTyps', 'srcIds', and 'srcTs' arrays must contain the same number of
              elements. These timestamps are included to support services which do not include
              a GET by {id} operation. If referencing a datatype which does not include a
