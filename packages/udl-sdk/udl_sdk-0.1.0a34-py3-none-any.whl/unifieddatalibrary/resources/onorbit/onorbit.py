              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          source: Source of the data.

          alt_name: Alternate name of the on-orbit object.

          category: Category of the on-orbit object. (Unknown, On-Orbit, Decayed, Cataloged Without
              State, Launch Nominal, Analyst Satellite, Cislunar, Lunar, Hyperbolic,
              Heliocentric, Interplanetary, Lagrangian, Docked).

          common_name: Common name of the on-orbit object.

          constellation: Constellation to which this satellite belongs.

          country_code: The country code. This value is typically the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 two-character
              country code, however it can also represent various consortiums that do not
              appear in the ISO document. The code must correspond to an existing country in

              code.

          decay_date: Date of decay.

          id_on_orbit: For the public catalog, the idOnOrbit is typically the satellite number as a
              string, but may be a UUID for analyst or other unknown or untracked satellites,
              auto-generated by the system.

          intl_des: International Designator, typically of the format YYYYLLLAAA, where YYYY is the
              launch year, LLL is the sequential launch number of that year, and AAA is an
              optional launch piece designator for the launch.

          launch_date: Date of launch.

          launch_site_id: Id of the associated launchSite entity.

          lifetime_years: Estimated lifetime of the on-orbit payload, if known.

          mission_number: Mission number of the on-orbit object.

          object_type: Type of on-orbit object: ROCKET BODY, DEBRIS, PAYLOAD, PLATFORM, MANNED,
              UNKNOWN.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data

              datasets.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          source: Source of the data.

          alt_name: Alternate name of the on-orbit object.

          category: Category of the on-orbit object. (Unknown, On-Orbit, Decayed, Cataloged Without

              Heliocentric, Interplanetary, Lagrangian, Docked).

          common_name: Common name of the on-orbit object.

          constellation: Constellation to which this satellite belongs.

          country_code: The country code. This value is typically the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 two-character
              country code, however it can also represent various consortiums that do not
              appear in the ISO document. The code must correspond to an existing country in

              code.

              string, but may be a UUID for analyst or other unknown or untracked satellites,
              auto-generated by the system.

          intl_des: International Designator, typically of the format YYYYLLLAAA, where YYYY is the
              launch year, LLL is the sequential launch number of that year, and AAA is an
              optional launch piece designator for the launch.

          launch_date: Date of launch.

          launch_site_id: Id of the associated launchSite entity.

          lifetime_years: Estimated lifetime of the on-orbit payload, if known.

              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If

          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          source: Source of the data.

          alt_name: Alternate name of the on-orbit object.

          category: Category of the on-orbit object. (Unknown, On-Orbit, Decayed, Cataloged Without
              State, Launch Nominal, Analyst Satellite, Cislunar, Lunar, Hyperbolic,
              Heliocentric, Interplanetary, Lagrangian, Docked).

          common_name: Common name of the on-orbit object.

          constellation: Constellation to which this satellite belongs.

          country_code: The country code. This value is typically the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 two-character
              country code, however it can also represent various consortiums that do not
              appear in the ISO document. The code must correspond to an existing country in
              the UDL’s country API. Call udl/country/{code} to get any associated FIPS code,
              ISO Alpha-3 code, or alternate code values that exist for the specified country
              code.

          decay_date: Date of decay.

          id_on_orbit: For the public catalog, the idOnOrbit is typically the satellite number as a
              string, but may be a UUID for analyst or other unknown or untracked satellites,
              auto-generated by the system.

          intl_des: International Designator, typically of the format YYYYLLLAAA, where YYYY is the
              launch year, LLL is the sequential launch number of that year, and AAA is an
              optional launch piece designator for the launch.

          launch_date: Date of launch.

          launch_site_id: Id of the associated launchSite entity.

          lifetime_years: Estimated lifetime of the on-orbit payload, if known.

          mission_number: Mission number of the on-orbit object.

          object_type: Type of on-orbit object: ROCKET BODY, DEBRIS, PAYLOAD, PLATFORM, MANNED,
              UNKNOWN.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.
