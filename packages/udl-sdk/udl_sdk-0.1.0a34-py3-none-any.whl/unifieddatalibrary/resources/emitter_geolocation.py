              degrees. -90 to 90 degrees (negative values south of equator).

          detect_lon: WGS-84 longitude of the most likely emitter location coordinate point, in
              degrees. -180 to 180 degrees (negative values west of Prime Meridian).

          end_time: The end time for this Emitter Geo Location data set in ISO 8601 UTC with
              microsecond precision.

          err_ellp: Confidence ellipsoid about the detection location [semi-major axis (meters),
              semi-minor axis (meters), orientation (degrees) measured clockwise (0-360 from
              true north)].

          external_id: Optional ID from external systems. This field has no meaning within UDL and is
              provided as a convenience for systems that require tracking of an internal
              system generated ID.

          id_rf_emitter: Optional identifier of the geolocated signal of interest RF Emitter for this
              observation. This ID can be used to obtain additional information on an RF
              Emitter object using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g. /udl/rfemitter/{id}). For
              example, the rfemitter object with idRFEmitter = abc would be queried as
              /udl/rfemitter/abc.

          id_sensor: Unique identifier of the reporting sensor. This ID can be used to obtain
              additional information on a sensor using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g.
              /udl/sensor/{id}). For example, the sensor with idSensor = abc would be queried
              as /udl/sensor/abc. Used when Emitter geolocation is done by a single sensor.

          max_freq: The maximum detected frequency in megahertz.

          max_prf: Maximum pulse repetition frequency of the emitter, measured in hertz. PRF is the
              number of pulses transmitted per second. This is the reciprocal of the minPRI
              (Pulse Repetition Interval) value.

          max_pri: Maximum pulse repetition interval of the emitter, measured in microseconds. The
              interval between the start of one pulse and the start of another.

          max_pw: Maximum pulse width of the emitter, measured in nanoseconds. This is the maximum
              duration of the pulse.

          min_freq: The minimum detected frequency in megahertz.

          min_prf: Minimum pulse repetition frequency of the emitter, measured in hertz. PRF is the
              number of pulses transmitted per second. This is the reciprocal of the maxPRI
              (Pulse Repetition Interval) value.

          min_pri: Minimum pulse repetition interval of the emitter, measured in microseconds. The
              interval between the start of one pulse and the start of another.

          min_pw: Minimum pulse width of the emitter, measured in nanoseconds. This is the minimum
              duration of the pulse.

          num_bursts: The count of single-burst observations used for this geolocation observation.

          order_id: The order identifier for this Emitter Geo Location data set.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier of the satellite used to identify and geolocate Emitter
              signals of interest of this observation. This may be an internal identifier and
              not necessarily a valid satellite number. Used when Emitter geolocation is done
              by a single satellite.

          orig_rf_emitter_id: Optional identifier of the emitter of interest for this observation. This may be
              an internal identifier and not necessarily a valid emitter Id.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this Emitter Geo Location. This may be an internal
              identifier and not necessarily a valid sensor ID. Used when Emitter geolocation
              is done by a single sensor.

          pass_group_id: Optional external identifier referencing the entity used in the calculation of
              the geolocation.

          pulse_shape: Describes the form of the emitted pulse and how its signal varies within the
              pulse duration (e.g. GAUSSIAN, RECTANGULAR, TRAPEZOIDAL, etc.).

          received_ts: The time representing the mean of the constituent single-burst observations in
              ISO 8601 UTC with microsecond precision.

          sat_no: Satellite/catalog number of the on-orbit spacecraft used to identify and
              geolocate Emitter signals of interest of this detection. Used when Emitter
              geolocation is done by a single satellite.

          signal_of_interest: The name of the signal of interest.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.
