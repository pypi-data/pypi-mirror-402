          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the target
              onorbit object of this observation. This may be an internal identifier and not

              identifier which produced this observation. This may be an internal identifier

              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

              observation.

          uct: Boolean indicating this observation is part of an uncorrelated track or was
              unable to be correlated to a known object. This flag should only be set to true
              by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was made
              and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be populated
              with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          yvel: Y velocity of target in kilometers/sec in J2000 coordinate frame.

          id_rf_emitter: Unique identifier of the transmitter. This ID can be used to obtain additional
              information on an RFEmitter using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g.
              /udl/rfemitter/{id}). For example, the RFEmitter with idRFEmitter = abc would be
              queried as /udl/rfemitter/abc.

              obtain additional information on a sensor using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g.
              /udl/sensor/{id}). For example, the sensor with idSensor = abc would be queried
              as /udl/sensor/abc.

          id_sensor_ref_receiver: Unique identifier of the reference receiver sensor. This ID can be used to
              obtain additional information on a sensor using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g.
              /udl/sensor/{id}). For example, the sensor with idSensor = abc would be queried
              as /udl/sensor/abc.

          lat: WGS-84 target latitude sub-point at observation time (obTime), represented as
              -90 to 90 degrees (negative values south of equator).

          lon: WGS-84 target longitude sub-point at observation time (obTime), represented as

          ob_position: The position of this observation within a track (FENCE, FIRST, IN, LAST,
              SINGLE). This identifier is optional and, if null, no assumption should be made
              regarding whether other observations may or may not exist to compose a track.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the target
              onorbit object of this observation. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily a valid satellite number.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this observation. This may be an internal identifier
              and not necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          orthogonal_rcs: Radar cross section in meters squared for orthogonal polarization.

          orthogonal_rcs_unc: One sigma uncertainty in orthogonal polarization Radar Cross Section, in
              meters^2.

          ra: Line of sight right ascension in degrees and J2000 coordinate frame.

          rcs: Radar cross section in meters squared for polarization principal.

          rcs_unc: One sigma uncertainty in principal polarization Radar Cross Section, in
              meters^2.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          snr: Signal to noise ratio, in dB.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          task_id: Optional identifier to indicate the specific tasking which produced this
              observation.

          timing_bias: Sensor timing bias in seconds.

          tof: Time of flight (TOF) in seconds. This is the calculated propagation time from
              transmitter-to-target-to-surveillance site.

          tof_bias: The Time of Flight (TOF) bias in seconds.

          tof_unc: One sigma uncertainty in time of flight in seconds.

          track_id: Unique identifier of a track that represents a tracklet for this observation.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          uct: Boolean indicating this observation is part of an uncorrelated track or was
              unable to be correlated to a known object. This flag should only be set to true
              by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was made
              and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be populated
              with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          xvel: X velocity of target in kilometers/sec in J2000 coordinate frame.

          yvel: Y velocity of target in kilometers/sec in J2000 coordinate frame.

          zvel: Z velocity of target in kilometers/sec in J2000 coordinate frame.
