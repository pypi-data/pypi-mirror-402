          range_rate_measured: Optional flag indicating whether the rangeRate value is measured (true) or

          senx: Sensor x position in km at obTime (if mobile/onorbit) in the specified
              senReferenceFrame. If senReferenceFrame is null then J2000 should be assumed.

          seny: Sensor y position in km at obTime (if mobile/onorbit) in the specified
              senReferenceFrame. If senReferenceFrame is null then J2000 should be assumed.

          uct: Boolean indicating this observation is part of an uncorrelated track or was
              unable to be correlated to a known object. This flag should only be set to true
              by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was made
              and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be populated
              with an internal data provider specific identifier.
