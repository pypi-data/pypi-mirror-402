        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          corr_type:
              Indicator of whether the type of correlation is OBSERVATION or TRACK:
              OBSERVATION: Identifies an observation is being correlated. TRACK: Identifies
              the entire track of observations is being correlated.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          msg_ts: Correlation message generation time, in ISO 8601 UTC format with millisecond
              precision.

          ob_id: Identifier of the Observation associated with this Correlation. If
              corrType=TRACK then this field should reference the first Observation in the
              track. Note: To retrieve all remaining Observations in the track, the GET query
              should include this Observation's source and origin field values, along with the
              trackId.

          ob_type: Indicator of whether the type of Observation(s) being correlated is DOA, EO,
              PASSIVE_RADAR, RADAR, RF, SAR, or SOISET: DOA: The observation type being
              correlated is Difference of Arrival. EO: The observation type being correlated
              is Electro-Optical. PASSIVE_RADAR: The observation type being correlated is
              Passive Radar. RADAR: The observation type being correlated is Radar. RF: The
              observation type being correlated is Radio Frequency. SAR: The observation type
              being correlated is Synthetic Aperture Radar. SOISET: The observation type being
              correlated is Space Object Identification Observation Set.

          reference_orbit_id: Identifier of the orbit state used for correlation.

          reference_orbit_type: Indicator of whether the reference orbit type used for correlation is an ELSET,
              ESID, or SV: ELSET: The reference orbit type is an Element Set. ESID: The
              reference orbit type is an Ephemeris Set. SV: The reference orbit type is a
              State Vector.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          algorithm_corr_type: Type of algorithm used for this correlation (e.g. ROTAS, GEOMETRIC, STATISTICAL,
              MAHALANOBIS, AI/ML, OTHER).

          alt_catalog: Name of the alternate catalog.

          alt_namespace: Associates one or more alternate catalogs with a source provider or system.
              Namespaces may be defined by their respective data providers or systems (e.g.
              JCO, 18SDS, EOSSS, EXO, KBR, KRTL, LeoLabs, NorthStar, SAFRAN, Slingshot).

          alt_object_id: Alternate unique object ID within the namespace.

          alt_uct: Boolean indicating whether the observation or track can be correlated to the
              alternate object specified under altObjectId. This flag should only be set to
              true by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was
              made and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be
              populated with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          astat: Astrostandard ROTAS correlation result (0 - 4), if applicable. Refer to ROTAS
              documentation for an explanation of ASTAT values.

          corr_quality: Correlation score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A score of 1.0 represents perfect
              correlation to the orbit of the corresponding satellite, such as when all
              observation residuals equal 0.

          id_parent_correlation: Identifier of the ObsCorrelation record from which this ObsCorrelation record
              originated. This behavior allows for different source providers/systems to make
              changes to a given correlation and maintain traceability back to the original
              correlation.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier indicates the target on-orbit object being correlated. This
              may be an internal identifier and not necessarily a valid satellite number.

          sat_no: Current 18th SDS satellite/catalog number of the target on-orbit object. Useful
              to know in the case where an observation is correlated to another
              satellite/catalog number.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          track_id: Identifier of the Track associated with this ObsCorrelation.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          corr_type:
              Indicator of whether the type of correlation is OBSERVATION or TRACK:
              OBSERVATION: Identifies an observation is being correlated. TRACK: Identifies
              the entire track of observations is being correlated.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          msg_ts: Correlation message generation time, in ISO 8601 UTC format with millisecond
              precision.

          ob_id: Identifier of the Observation associated with this Correlation. If
              corrType=TRACK then this field should reference the first Observation in the
              track. Note: To retrieve all remaining Observations in the track, the GET query
              should include this Observation's source and origin field values, along with the
              trackId.

          ob_type: Indicator of whether the type of Observation(s) being correlated is DOA, EO,
              PASSIVE_RADAR, RADAR, RF, SAR, or SOISET: DOA: The observation type being
              correlated is Difference of Arrival. EO: The observation type being correlated
              is Electro-Optical. PASSIVE_RADAR: The observation type being correlated is
              Passive Radar. RADAR: The observation type being correlated is Radar. RF: The
              observation type being correlated is Radio Frequency. SAR: The observation type
              being correlated is Synthetic Aperture Radar. SOISET: The observation type being
              correlated is Space Object Identification Observation Set.

          reference_orbit_id: Identifier of the orbit state used for correlation.

          reference_orbit_type: Indicator of whether the reference orbit type used for correlation is an ELSET,
              ESID, or SV: ELSET: The reference orbit type is an Element Set. ESID: The
              reference orbit type is an Ephemeris Set. SV: The reference orbit type is a
              State Vector.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          algorithm_corr_type: Type of algorithm used for this correlation (e.g. ROTAS, GEOMETRIC, STATISTICAL,
              MAHALANOBIS, AI/ML, OTHER).

          alt_catalog: Name of the alternate catalog.

          alt_namespace: Associates one or more alternate catalogs with a source provider or system.
              Namespaces may be defined by their respective data providers or systems (e.g.
              JCO, 18SDS, EOSSS, EXO, KBR, KRTL, LeoLabs, NorthStar, SAFRAN, Slingshot).

          alt_object_id: Alternate unique object ID within the namespace.

          alt_uct: Boolean indicating whether the observation or track can be correlated to the
              alternate object specified under altObjectId. This flag should only be set to
              true by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was
              made and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be
              populated with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          astat: Astrostandard ROTAS correlation result (0 - 4), if applicable. Refer to ROTAS
              documentation for an explanation of ASTAT values.

          corr_quality: Correlation score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A score of 1.0 represents perfect
              correlation to the orbit of the corresponding satellite, such as when all
              observation residuals equal 0.

          id_parent_correlation: Identifier of the ObsCorrelation record from which this ObsCorrelation record
              originated. This behavior allows for different source providers/systems to make
              changes to a given correlation and maintain traceability back to the original
              correlation.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier indicates the target on-orbit object being correlated. This
              may be an internal identifier and not necessarily a valid satellite number.

          sat_no: Current 18th SDS satellite/catalog number of the target on-orbit object. Useful
              to know in the case where an observation is correlated to another
              satellite/catalog number.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          track_id: Identifier of the Track associated with this ObsCorrelation.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.
