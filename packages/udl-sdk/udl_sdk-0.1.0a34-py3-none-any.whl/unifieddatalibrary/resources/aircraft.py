              EAGLE, KC-130 HERCULES, etc.) of this aircraft. Intended as, but not constrained
              to, MIL-STD-6016 environment dependent specific type designations.

          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          category: The category of aircraft (e.g. M = Military, C = Commercial).

          command: The Air Force major command (MAJCOM) overseeing the aircraft.

          cruise_speed: The cruise speed of the aircraft, in kilometers/hour.

          dtd: Military data network data transfer device ID for this aircraft.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          id_entity: ID of the parent entity for this aircraft.

          max_speed: The maximum air speed of the aircraft, in kilometers/hour.

          min_req_runway_ft: The minimum length of runway required to land this aircraft, in feet. Note: The
              corresponding equivalent field is not converted by the UDL and may or may not be
              supplied by the provider. The provider/consumer is responsible for all unit
              conversions.

              The minimum length of runway required to land this aircraft, in meters. Note:
              The corresponding equivalent field is not converted by the UDL and may or may

          nominal_ta_time: The nominal turnaround time for this aircraft, in minutes.

          notes: Optional notes/comments for this aircraft.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          owner: The wing or unit that owns the aircraft.

          serial_number: Full serial number of the aircraft.

          tail_number: The tail number of this aircraft.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
