class EopAbridged(BaseModel):
    """
    Model representation of Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) produced by the IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service). Earth Orientation Parameters describe the irregularities of the earth's rotation. Technically, they are the parameters which provide the rotation of the ITRS (International Terrestrial Reference System) to the ICRS (International Celestial Reference System) as a function of time.
    Universal time -- Universal time (UT1) is the time of the earth clock, which performs one revolution in about 24h. It is practically proportional to the sidereal time. The excess revolution time is called length of day (LOD).
    Coordinates of the pole -- x and y are the coordinates of the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP) relative to the IRP, the IERS Reference Pole. The CEP differs from the instantaneous rotation axis by quasi-diurnal terms with amplitudes under 0.01" (see Seidelmann, 1982). The x-axis is in the direction of the ITRF zero-meridian; the y-axis is in the direction 90 degrees West longitude.
    Celestial pole offsets -- Celestial pole offsets are described in the IAU Precession and Nutation models. The observed differences with respect to the conventional celestial pole position defined by the models are monitored and reported by the IERS.
    IERS Bulletins A and B provide current information on the Earth's orientation in the IERS Reference System.  This includes Universal Time, coordinates of the terrestrial pole, and celestial pole offsets.  Bulletin A gives an advanced solution updated weekly; the standard solution is given monthly in Bulletin B. Fields suffixed with 'B' are Bulletin B values. All solutions are continuous within their respective uncertainties.  Bulletin A is issued by the IERS Rapid Service/Prediction Centre at the U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, DC and Bulletin B is issued by the IERS Earth Orientation Centre at the Paris Observatory. IERS Bulletin A reports the latest determinations for polar motion, UT1-UTC, and nutation offsets at daily intervals based on a combination of contributed analysis results using data from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR). Predictions for variations a year into the future are also provided. Meteorological predictions of variations in Atmospheric Angular Momentum (AAM) are used to aid in the prediction of near-term UT1-UTC changes. This publication is prepared by the IERS Rapid Service/Prediction Center.
