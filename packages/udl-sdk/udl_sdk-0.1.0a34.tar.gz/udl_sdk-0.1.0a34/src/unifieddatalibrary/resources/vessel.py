              datasets.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          alt_vessel_id: The original source Id for this vessel.

          callsign: A uniquely designated identifier for the vessel's transmitter station. All radio
              transmissions must be individually identified by the call sign. Merchant and
              naval vessels are assigned call signs by their national licensing authorities.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          first_seen: The date this vessel was first seen.

          hull_num: The vessel hull number designation of this maritime vessel. The hull number is a
              1-6 character alphanumeric entry assigned to a ship and painted on the hull.

          id_organization: The UDL ID of the organization that owns the vessel.

          imon: The International Maritime Organization Number of the vessel. IMON is a
              seven-digit number that uniquely identifies the vessel.

          length: The overall length of the vessel, in meters. A value of 511 indicates a vessel
              length of 511 meters or greater.

          max_draught: The maximum static draught, in meters, of the vessel defined as the distance
              between the ship’s keel and the waterline of the vessel.

          max_speed: The maximum possible speed of this vessel in meters per second.

          mmsi: The Maritime Mobile Service Identity of the vessel. MMSI is a nine-digit number
              that identifies the transmitter station of the vessel.

          num_blades: The number of blades per shaft for this vessel.

          num_shafts: The number of shafts on this vessel.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          prop_type: The type of propulsion employed by this vessel.

          sconum: The Ship Control Number (SCONUM) is a naval vessel identification number
              (alphanumeric code) assigned by the Office of Naval Intelligence. SCONUM is
              sometimes referred to as NOIC ID. SCONUMs are typically of the form A#####,
              where A is an alpha character and # is numerical.

          status: The status of this vessel.

          stern_type: The stern type code (Counter, Cruiser) associated with this vessel.

          vessel_builder: The shipbuilder who built this vessel.

          vessel_class: The common name for a group of ships with similar design, usually named for the
              first vessel of the class.

          vessel_flag: The flag of the subject vessel.

          vessel_name: The name of this vessel. Vessel names that exceed the AIS 20 character are
              shortened (not truncated) to 15 character-spaces, followed by an underscore and
              the last 4 characters-spaces of the vessel full name.

          vessel_type: The reported ship type (e.g. Passenger, Tanker, Cargo, Other, etc.).

          vsl_wt: The weight in tons, of this vessel.

          width: The breadth of the vessel, in meters. A value of 63 indicates a vessel breadth
              of 63 meters or greater.

          year_built: Year the vessel went into service.

          alt_vessel_id: The original source Id for this vessel.

          callsign: A uniquely designated identifier for the vessel's transmitter station. All radio
              transmissions must be individually identified by the call sign. Merchant and
              naval vessels are assigned call signs by their national licensing authorities.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          first_seen: The date this vessel was first seen.

              seven-digit number that uniquely identifies the vessel.

          length: The overall length of the vessel, in meters. A value of 511 indicates a vessel
              length of 511 meters or greater.

          max_draught: The maximum static draught, in meters, of the vessel defined as the distance
              between the ship’s keel and the waterline of the vessel.

          max_speed: The maximum possible speed of this vessel in meters per second.

          mmsi: The Maritime Mobile Service Identity of the vessel. MMSI is a nine-digit number
              that identifies the transmitter station of the vessel.

          num_blades: The number of blades per shaft for this vessel.

          num_shafts: The number of shafts on this vessel.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          prop_type: The type of propulsion employed by this vessel.

          sconum: The Ship Control Number (SCONUM) is a naval vessel identification number
              (alphanumeric code) assigned by the Office of Naval Intelligence. SCONUM is
              sometimes referred to as NOIC ID. SCONUMs are typically of the form A#####,
              where A is an alpha character and # is numerical.

          status: The status of this vessel.

          stern_type: The stern type code (Counter, Cruiser) associated with this vessel.

          vessel_builder: The shipbuilder who built this vessel.

          vessel_class: The common name for a group of ships with similar design, usually named for the
              first vessel of the class.

          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          source: Source of the data.

          body_id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          alt_vessel_id: The original source Id for this vessel.

          callsign: A uniquely designated identifier for the vessel's transmitter station. All radio
              transmissions must be individually identified by the call sign. Merchant and
              naval vessels are assigned call signs by their national licensing authorities.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          first_seen: The date this vessel was first seen.

          hull_num: The vessel hull number designation of this maritime vessel. The hull number is a
              1-6 character alphanumeric entry assigned to a ship and painted on the hull.

          id_entity: Unique identifier of the parent entity. idEntity is required for Put.

          id_organization: The UDL ID of the organization that owns the vessel.

          imon: The International Maritime Organization Number of the vessel. IMON is a
              seven-digit number that uniquely identifies the vessel.

          length: The overall length of the vessel, in meters. A value of 511 indicates a vessel
              length of 511 meters or greater.

          max_draught: The maximum static draught, in meters, of the vessel defined as the distance
              between the ship’s keel and the waterline of the vessel.

          max_speed: The maximum possible speed of this vessel in meters per second.

          mmsi: The Maritime Mobile Service Identity of the vessel. MMSI is a nine-digit number
              that identifies the transmitter station of the vessel.

          num_blades: The number of blades per shaft for this vessel.

          num_shafts: The number of shafts on this vessel.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          prop_type: The type of propulsion employed by this vessel.

          sconum: The Ship Control Number (SCONUM) is a naval vessel identification number
              (alphanumeric code) assigned by the Office of Naval Intelligence. SCONUM is
              sometimes referred to as NOIC ID. SCONUMs are typically of the form A#####,
              where A is an alpha character and # is numerical.

          status: The status of this vessel.

          stern_type: The stern type code (Counter, Cruiser) associated with this vessel.

          vessel_builder: The shipbuilder who built this vessel.

          vessel_class: The common name for a group of ships with similar design, usually named for the
              first vessel of the class.

          vessel_description: Further description or explanation of the vessel or type.

          vessel_flag: The flag of the subject vessel.

          vessel_name: The name of this vessel. Vessel names that exceed the AIS 20 character are
              shortened (not truncated) to 15 character-spaces, followed by an underscore and
              the last 4 characters-spaces of the vessel full name.

          vessel_type: The reported ship type (e.g. Passenger, Tanker, Cargo, Other, etc.).

          vsl_wt: The weight in tons, of this vessel.

          width: The breadth of the vessel, in meters. A value of 63 indicates a vessel breadth
              of 63 meters or greater.

          year_built: Year the vessel went into service.
