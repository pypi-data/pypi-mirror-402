              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

          type: Type of organization (e.g. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATION, CONSORTIUM, ACADEMIC).

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          active: Boolean indicating if this organization is currently active.

              quoted company, subsidiary, goverment department/agency, etc).

          country_code: Country of the physical location of the organization. This value is typically
