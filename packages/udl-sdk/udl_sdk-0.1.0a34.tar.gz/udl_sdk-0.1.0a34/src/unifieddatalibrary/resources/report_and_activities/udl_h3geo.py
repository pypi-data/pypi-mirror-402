        Service operation to take a single H3Geo record and many associated H3Geo hex

        intended to be used for automated feeds into UDL. A specific role is required to
        perform this service operation. Please contact the UDL team for assistance.

        Args:
          cells: The collection of hex cells contained in this H3 data set. The number of cells
              is a function of the specified resolution.

          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          num_cells: The number of cells associated with this H3 Geo data set. At this time, UDL
              supports up to 50,000 cells.

          source: Source of the data.

          start_time: Start time for this H3 Geo data set in ISO 8601 UTC with millisecond precision.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          center_freq: The center frequency of this H3 Geo data set measured in megahertz.

          end_time: End time for this H3 Geo data set in ISO 8601 UTC with millisecond precision.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          resolution: H3 resolution (0 – 15) for the data set. At this time, UDL supports a resolution
              of 3 or less.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          type: An optional field containing the type of data that is represented by this H3 Geo
              data set.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request
