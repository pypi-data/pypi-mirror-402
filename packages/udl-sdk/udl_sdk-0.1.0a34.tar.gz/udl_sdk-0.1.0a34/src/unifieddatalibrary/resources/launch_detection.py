              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          message_type: Type of message for the data.

          observation_latitude: Latitude of launch vehicle at observation time (in Degrees). -90 to 90 degrees
              (negative values south of equator).

          observation_longitude: Longitude of launch vehicle at observation time (in Degrees).

          observation_time: Time of observation.

          sequence_number: Integer indicating how messages should be sequenced for a specific event.

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          descriptor: Optional source-provided and searchable metadata or descriptor of the data.

          event_id: Id to be able to correlate different messages to a specific event.

          high_zenith_azimuth: Flag indicating that the Launch azimuth is uncertain due to near vertical flight
              path.

          inclination: Orbit Inclination (in Degrees).

          launch_azimuth: Angle measured clockwise from North for the launch heading (in Degrees).

          launch_latitude: Geodetic Latitude of launch origin (in Degrees). -90 to 90 degrees (negative

          launch_time: Time of Launch.

          observation_altitude: Altitude of launch vehicle at observation time (in KM).

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If

          raan: Orbit Right Ascension of Ascending Node (in Degrees).

          stereo_flag: Flag indicating multiple observers were used.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
