              format, with millisecond precision.

          rz_point: Rendezvous point for the tanker and receiver during this air refueling event.
              Possible values are AN (Anchor Nav Point), AP (Anchor Pattern), CP (Control
              Point), ET (Entry Point), EX (Exit Point), IP (Initial Point), NC (Nav Check

          rz_type: Type of rendezvous used for this air refueling event. Possible values are BUD
              (Buddy), EN (Enroute), GCI (Ground Control), PP (Point Parallel).

          short_track: Flag indicating that the receiver unit has requested flying a short portion of
              an air refueling track.

          status_code: Status of this air refueling event track reservation. Receivers are responsible
              for scheduling or reserving air refueling tracks. Possible values are A
              (Altitude Reservation), R (Reserved), or Q (Questionable).

          receivers: Collection of receiver aircraft associated with this Air Event.

          remarks: Collection of remarks associated with this Air Event.

          rev_track: Flag indicating if the receiver unit has requested flying an air refueling track
              in both directions.

          rzct: The Rendezvous Control Time is the planned time the tanker and receiver aircraft
              will rendezvous for an en route type air refueling event, in ISO 8601 UTC
              format, with millisecond precision.

          rz_point: Rendezvous point for the tanker and receiver during this air refueling event.
              Possible values are AN (Anchor Nav Point), AP (Anchor Pattern), CP (Control
              Point), ET (Entry Point), EX (Exit Point), IP (Initial Point), NC (Nav Check
              Point).

          rz_type: Type of rendezvous used for this air refueling event. Possible values are BUD
              (Buddy), EN (Enroute), GCI (Ground Control), PP (Point Parallel).

          short_track: Flag indicating that the receiver unit has requested flying a short portion of
              an air refueling track.

          status_code: Status of this air refueling event track reservation. Receivers are responsible
              for scheduling or reserving air refueling tracks. Possible values are A
              (Altitude Reservation), R (Reserved), or Q (Questionable).

          tankers: Collection of tanker aircraft associated with this Air Event.
