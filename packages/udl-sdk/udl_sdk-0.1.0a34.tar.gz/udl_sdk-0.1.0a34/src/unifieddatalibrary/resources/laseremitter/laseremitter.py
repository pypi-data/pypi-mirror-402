        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          laser_name: The name of this laser within the laser system or facility.

          laser_type: The type of laser (e.g. CONTINUOUS WAVE, PULSED, etc.).

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system if not provided on
              create operations.

          atmospheric_transmission: Maximum possible laser-to-space atmospheric transmission (a value between zero
              and one, usually assumed to be unity for all lasers except for lasers with
              wavelengths heavily absorbed by the atmosphere).

          beam_output_power: The beam director aperture average (equivalent CW) output power is the total
              laser average power that is transmitted away from the final exit aperture of the
              optical system. For a CW laser, this is equivalent to the laser device CW power
              multiplied by the throughput of the optical system, including the beam director
              telescope. For a pulsed laser, this is equivalent to the laser device energy per
              pulse multiplied by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) multiplied by the
              throughput of the optical system including the beam director telescope. Measured
              in Watts.

          beam_waist: The beam waist (radius) of this laser at the exit aperture, in centimeters.

          divergence: Minimum possible divergence half-angle of this laser, referenced from the
              optical axis to the 1/e point of the beam's far field irradiance profile,
              measured in microradians.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          id_entity: Unique identifier of the parent entity. idEntity is required for PUT.

          is_operational: A Boolean indicating whether or not this laser emitter is operational. False
              indicates that the laser specified in this record is no longer available and can
              be considered defunct. This field is true by default.

          max_duration: The maximum time that the laser would be "on" for a given test(s) for laser
              activity, in seconds.

          max_focus_range: The maximum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          min_focus_range: The minimum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pulse_fluence: The amount of energy in each laser pulse exiting from the beam
              director/telescope, measured in Joules.

          pulse_peak_power: The instantaneous single pulse peak power exiting from the laser device,
              measured in Watts.

          pulse_rep_freq: The pulse repetition frequency of this laser, measured in kilohertz.

          pulse_shape: The pulse shape (waveform) of this laser, e.g. "RECTANGULAR," "SAWTOOTH,"
              "GAUSSIAN," etc.

          pulse_width: The laser device pulse duration, measured in seconds.

          wavelength: The center wavelength of this laser, in micrometers.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          laser_name: The name of this laser within the laser system or facility.

          laser_type: The type of laser (e.g. CONTINUOUS WAVE, PULSED, etc.).

          source: Source of the data.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system if not provided on
              create operations.

          atmospheric_transmission: Maximum possible laser-to-space atmospheric transmission (a value between zero
              and one, usually assumed to be unity for all lasers except for lasers with
              wavelengths heavily absorbed by the atmosphere).

          beam_output_power: The beam director aperture average (equivalent CW) output power is the total
              laser average power that is transmitted away from the final exit aperture of the
              optical system. For a CW laser, this is equivalent to the laser device CW power
              multiplied by the throughput of the optical system, including the beam director
              telescope. For a pulsed laser, this is equivalent to the laser device energy per
              pulse multiplied by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) multiplied by the
              throughput of the optical system including the beam director telescope. Measured
              in Watts.

          beam_waist: The beam waist (radius) of this laser at the exit aperture, in centimeters.

          divergence: Minimum possible divergence half-angle of this laser, referenced from the
              optical axis to the 1/e point of the beam's far field irradiance profile,
              measured in microradians.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          id_entity: Unique identifier of the parent entity. idEntity is required for PUT.

          is_operational: A Boolean indicating whether or not this laser emitter is operational. False
              indicates that the laser specified in this record is no longer available and can
              be considered defunct. This field is true by default.

          max_duration: The maximum time that the laser would be "on" for a given test(s) for laser
              activity, in seconds.

          max_focus_range: The maximum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          min_focus_range: The minimum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pulse_fluence: The amount of energy in each laser pulse exiting from the beam
              director/telescope, measured in Joules.

          pulse_peak_power: The instantaneous single pulse peak power exiting from the laser device,
              measured in Watts.

          pulse_rep_freq: The pulse repetition frequency of this laser, measured in kilohertz.

          pulse_shape: The pulse shape (waveform) of this laser, e.g. "RECTANGULAR," "SAWTOOTH,"
              "GAUSSIAN," etc.

          pulse_width: The laser device pulse duration, measured in seconds.

          wavelength: The center wavelength of this laser, in micrometers.

        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          laser_name: The name of this laser within the laser system or facility.

          laser_type: The type of laser (e.g. CONTINUOUS WAVE, PULSED, etc.).

          source: Source of the data.

          body_id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system if not provided on
              create operations.

          atmospheric_transmission: Maximum possible laser-to-space atmospheric transmission (a value between zero
              and one, usually assumed to be unity for all lasers except for lasers with
              wavelengths heavily absorbed by the atmosphere).

          beam_output_power: The beam director aperture average (equivalent CW) output power is the total
              laser average power that is transmitted away from the final exit aperture of the
              optical system. For a CW laser, this is equivalent to the laser device CW power
              multiplied by the throughput of the optical system, including the beam director
              telescope. For a pulsed laser, this is equivalent to the laser device energy per
              pulse multiplied by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) multiplied by the
              throughput of the optical system including the beam director telescope. Measured
              in Watts.

          beam_waist: The beam waist (radius) of this laser at the exit aperture, in centimeters.

          divergence: Minimum possible divergence half-angle of this laser, referenced from the
              optical axis to the 1/e point of the beam's far field irradiance profile,
              measured in microradians.

          entity: An entity is a generic representation of any object within a space/SSA system
              such as sensors, on-orbit objects, RF Emitters, space craft buses, etc. An
              entity can have an operating unit, a location (if terrestrial), and statuses.

          id_entity: Unique identifier of the parent entity. idEntity is required for PUT.

          is_operational: A Boolean indicating whether or not this laser emitter is operational. False
              indicates that the laser specified in this record is no longer available and can
              be considered defunct. This field is true by default.

          max_duration: The maximum time that the laser would be "on" for a given test(s) for laser
              activity, in seconds.

          max_focus_range: The maximum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          min_focus_range: The minimum possible focus range of this laser, measured in kilometers.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pulse_fluence: The amount of energy in each laser pulse exiting from the beam
              director/telescope, measured in Joules.

          pulse_peak_power: The instantaneous single pulse peak power exiting from the laser device,
              measured in Watts.

          pulse_rep_freq: The pulse repetition frequency of this laser, measured in kilohertz.

          pulse_shape: The pulse shape (waveform) of this laser, e.g. "RECTANGULAR," "SAWTOOTH,"
              "GAUSSIAN," etc.

          pulse_width: The laser device pulse duration, measured in seconds.

          wavelength: The center wavelength of this laser, in micrometers.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
