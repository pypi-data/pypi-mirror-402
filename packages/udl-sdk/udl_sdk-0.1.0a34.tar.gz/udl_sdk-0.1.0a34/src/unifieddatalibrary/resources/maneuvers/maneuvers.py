          sourced_data: Optional array of UDL data (elsets, state vectors, etc) UUIDs used to build this
              maneuver. See the associated sourcedDataTypes array for the specific types of
              data for the positionally corresponding UUIDs in this array (the two arrays must
              match in size).

          sourced_data_types: Optional array of UDL data types used to build this maneuver (e.g. EO, RADAR,
              RF, DOA, ELSET, SV). See the associated sourcedData array for the specific UUIDs
              of data for the positionally corresponding data types in this array (the two
              arrays must match in size).

          state_model: Name of the state model used to generate the maneuver data.

          state_model_version: Version of the state model used to generate the maneuver data.

          status: Status of this maneuver (CANCELLED, PLANNED, POSSIBLE, REDACTED, VERIFIED).

              CANCELLED: A previously planned maneuver whose execution was cancelled.

              PLANNED: A maneuver planned to take place at the eventStartTime.

              POSSIBLE: A possible maneuver detected by observation of the spacecraft or by
              evaluation of the spacecraft orbit.

              REDACTED: A redaction of a reported possible maneuver that has been determined
              to have not taken place after further observation/evaluation.

              VERIFIED: A maneuver whose execution has been verified, either by the
              owner/operator or observation/evaluation.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          total_burn_time: The estimated total active burn time of a maneuver, in seconds. This includes
              the sum of all burns in numAccelPoints. Not to be confused with the total
              duration of the maneuver.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          uct: Boolean indicating this maneuver was unable to be correlated to a known object.
              This flag should only be set to true by data providers after an attempt to
              correlate to an on-orbit object was made and failed. If unable to correlate, the
              'origObjectId' field may be populated with an internal data provider specific
              identifier.

              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Identifier provided by source to indicate the target on-orbit object performing

              consists of identification data, the classical elements and drag parameters.

          post_event_id_elset: Optional identifier of the element set for the post-maneuver orbit.

          post_event_id_state_vector: Optional identifier of the state vector for the post-maneuver trajectory of the

          post_event_state_vector: This service provides operations for querying and manipulation of state vectors
              for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and

              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see

              provider.

              trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
              frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
              may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see

              provider.

              coefficient vary depending on provider. Users should consult the data provider
              to verify the units of the radiation pressure coefficient.

          pre_sigma_u: Pre-event standard deviation, in kilometers, of spacecraft position in the 'U'
              unit vector direction.

          pre_sigma_v: Pre-event standard deviation, in kilometers, of spacecraft position in the 'V'
              unit vector direction.

          pre_sigma_w: Pre-event standard deviation, in kilometers, of spacecraft position in the 'W'
              unit vector direction.

              UTC format.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the target on-orbit object.

          sourced_data: Optional array of UDL data (elsets, state vectors, etc) UUIDs used to build this
              maneuver. See the associated sourcedDataTypes array for the specific types of
              data for the positionally corresponding UUIDs in this array (the two arrays must
              match in size).

          sourced_data_types: Optional array of UDL data types used to build this maneuver (e.g. EO, RADAR,

              of data for the positionally corresponding data types in this array (the two
              arrays must match in size).

              VERIFIED: A maneuver whose execution has been verified, either by the
              owner/operator or observation/evaluation.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          total_burn_time: The estimated total active burn time of a maneuver, in seconds. This includes
              the sum of all burns in numAccelPoints. Not to be confused with the total
              duration of the maneuver.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          uct: Boolean indicating this maneuver was unable to be correlated to a known object.
              This flag should only be set to true by data providers after an attempt to
              correlate to an on-orbit object was made and failed. If unable to correlate, the
              'origObjectId' field may be populated with an internal data provider specific
              identifier.
