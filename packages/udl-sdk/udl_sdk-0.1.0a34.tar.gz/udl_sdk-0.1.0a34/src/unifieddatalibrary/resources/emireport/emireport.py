              reference, would be 4QFJ12345678, which consists of three parts:

          sat_name: The name of the spacecraft whose link is being affected by the EMI.

          sat_no: Satellite/Catalog number of the affected OnOrbit object.

              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.
