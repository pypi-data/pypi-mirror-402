              incoming light from an apparently empty part of the night sky.

          solar_dec_angle: Angle from the sun to the equatorial plane, in degrees.

          solar_eq_phase_angle: The angle, in degrees, between the projections of the target-to-observer vector
              and the target-to-sun vector onto the equatorial plane. The angle is represented
              as negative when closing (i.e. before the opposition) and positive when opening
              (after the opposition).

          solar_phase_angle: The angle, in degrees, between the target-to-observer vector and the
              target-to-sun vector.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          task_id: Optional identifier to indicate the specific tasking which produced this
              observation.

          timing_bias: Sensor timing bias in seconds.

          track_id: Optional identifier of the track to which this observation belongs.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          uct: Boolean indicating this observation is part of an uncorrelated track or was
              unable to be correlated to a known object. This flag should only be set to true
              by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was made
              and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be populated
              with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          umbra: Boolean indicating that the target object was in umbral eclipse at the time of
              this observation.

          zeroptd: Formula: 2.5 \\** log_10 (zero_mag_counts / expDuration).

          zero_ptd_unc: This is the uncertainty in the zero point for the filter used for this
              observation/row in units of mag. For use with differential photometry.

          senvely: Cartesian Y velocity of the observing mobile/onorbit sensor at obTime, in
              kilometers per second, in the specified senReferenceFrame. If senReferenceFrame

              then J2K should be assumed.

          senz: Cartesian Z position of the observing mobile/onorbit sensor at obTime, in
              kilometers, in the specified senReferenceFrame. If senReferenceFrame is null
              then J2K should be assumed.

              and the target-to-sun vector onto the equatorial plane. The angle is represented
              as negative when closing (i.e. before the opposition) and positive when opening
              (after the opposition).

          solar_phase_angle: The angle, in degrees, between the target-to-observer vector and the
              target-to-sun vector.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          uct: Boolean indicating this observation is part of an uncorrelated track or was
              unable to be correlated to a known object. This flag should only be set to true
              by data providers after an attempt to correlate to an on-orbit object was made
              and failed. If unable to correlate, the 'origObjectId' field may be populated
              with an internal data provider specific identifier.

          umbra: Boolean indicating that the target object was in umbral eclipse at the time of
              this observation.

          zeroptd: Formula: 2.5 \\** log_10 (zero_mag_counts / expDuration).

          zero_ptd_unc: This is the uncertainty in the zero point for the filter used for this
              observation/row in units of mag. For use with differential photometry.
