              3166-1 alpha-2 country designation of the port country. The three remaining
              characters identify a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but
              if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid
              confusion with the letters "O" and "I" respectively.

          lon: WGS84 longitude of the location, in degrees. -180 to 180 degrees (negative
              values west of Prime Meridian).

          max_draught: Maximum allowed vessel draught. Draught is the principal dimensions of any
              waterborne vessel defined as the distance between the ship’s keel and the
              waterline of the vessel measured in meters.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pilot_reqd: Flag indicating whether a pilot is required at this port.

          port_name: The name of this port.

          shelter: The shelter afforded from wind, sea, and swell refers to the area where normal
              port operations are conducted, usually the wharf area. Shelter afforded by the
              anchorage area may be given for ports where cargo is handled by lighters. Values
              given are EXCELLENT, FAIR, GOOD, POOR, or NONE.

          tide_range: The tide range of this port in meters.
