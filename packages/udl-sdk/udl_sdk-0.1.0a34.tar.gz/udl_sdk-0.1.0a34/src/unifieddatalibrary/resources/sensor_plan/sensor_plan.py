              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          rec_type: The type of records that comprise this parent set (COLLECT, CONTACT).

          source: Source of the data.

          start_time: The start time of the plan or schedule, in ISO 8601 UTC format.

          type: The type of this sensor plan/schedule (PLAN, REQUEST, SCHEDULE).

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          collect_requests: The list of collect requests belonging to the SensorPlan. Each collect request
              is associated with a parent SensorPlan via the IdPlan. If provided, the list
              must have the same size as reqTotal.

          customer: The customer for this plan or schedule.

          end_time: The end time of the plan or schedule, in ISO 8601 UTC format.

          id_sensor: Unique identifier of the requested/schedule/planned sensor associated with this
              request.

          name: Name associated with this plan or schedule.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the source to indicate the sensor identifier
              requested/scheduled/planned for this request. This may be an internal identifier
              and not necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          purpose: The purpose/description of this plan or schedule.

          req_total: The total number of requests contained in this plan or schedule. Value of this
              field must match the size of collectRequest list if the list is provided and can
              be null or any value otherwise.

          sen_network: The sensor or ground network associated with this plan or schedule.

          status: The status of this plan or schedule (ACCEPTED, APPROVED, COMPLETED, PROPOSED,
              REJECTED, REQUESTED, SCHEDULED).

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.
