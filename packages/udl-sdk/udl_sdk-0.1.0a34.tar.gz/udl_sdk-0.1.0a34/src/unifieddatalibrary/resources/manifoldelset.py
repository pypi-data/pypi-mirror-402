        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          epoch: Elset epoch time in ISO 8601 UTC format, with microsecond precision.

          id_manifold: Identifier of the parent Manifold record.

          source: Source of the data.

          tmp_sat_no: A placeholder satellite number and not a true NORAD catalog number.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          apogee: The Orbit point furthest from the center of the earth in kilometers.

          arg_of_perigee: The argument of perigee is the angle in degrees formed between the perigee and
              the ascending node. If the perigee would occur at the ascending node, the
              argument of perigee would be 0.

          b_star: The drag term for SGP4 orbital model, used for calculating decay constants for
              altitude, eccentricity etc, measured in inverse earth radii.

          eccentricity: The orbital eccentricity of an astronomical object is a parameter that
              determines the amount by which its orbit around another body deviates from a
              perfect circle. A value of 0 is a circular orbit, values between 0 and 1 form an
              elliptic orbit, 1 is a parabolic escape orbit, and greater than 1 is a
              hyperbolic escape orbit.

          inclination: The angle between the equator and the orbit when looking from the center of the
              Earth. If the orbit went exactly around the equator from left to right, then the
              inclination would be 0. The inclination ranges from 0 to 180 degrees.

          mean_anomaly: Where the satellite is in its orbital path. The mean anomaly ranges from 0 to
              360 degrees. The mean anomaly is referenced to the perigee. If the satellite
              were at the perigee, the mean anomaly would be 0.

          mean_motion: The constant angular speed required for the body to complete one circular orbit
              in the same amount of time as the actual elliptical orbit with variable speed.
              Measured in revolutions per day.

          mean_motion_d_dot: 2nd derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day cubed.

          mean_motion_dot: 1st derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day squared.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          perigee: The orbit point nearest to the center of the earth in kilometers.

          period: Period of the orbit equal to inverse of mean motion.

          raan: Right ascension of the ascending node, or RAAN is the angle as measured in
              degrees eastwards (or, as seen from the north, counterclockwise) from the First
              Point of Aries to the ascending node, which is where the orbit crosses the
              equator when traveling north.

          rev_no: The current revolution number. The value is incremented when a satellite crosses
              the equator on an ascending pass.

          semi_major_axis: The sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances divided by two. For circular
              orbits, the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies,
              not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          epoch: Elset epoch time in ISO 8601 UTC format, with microsecond precision.

          id_manifold: Identifier of the parent Manifold record.

          source: Source of the data.

          tmp_sat_no: A placeholder satellite number and not a true NORAD catalog number.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          apogee: The Orbit point furthest from the center of the earth in kilometers.

          arg_of_perigee: The argument of perigee is the angle in degrees formed between the perigee and
              the ascending node. If the perigee would occur at the ascending node, the
              argument of perigee would be 0.

          b_star: The drag term for SGP4 orbital model, used for calculating decay constants for
              altitude, eccentricity etc, measured in inverse earth radii.

          eccentricity: The orbital eccentricity of an astronomical object is a parameter that
              determines the amount by which its orbit around another body deviates from a
              perfect circle. A value of 0 is a circular orbit, values between 0 and 1 form an
              elliptic orbit, 1 is a parabolic escape orbit, and greater than 1 is a
              hyperbolic escape orbit.

          inclination: The angle between the equator and the orbit when looking from the center of the
              Earth. If the orbit went exactly around the equator from left to right, then the
              inclination would be 0. The inclination ranges from 0 to 180 degrees.

          mean_anomaly: Where the satellite is in its orbital path. The mean anomaly ranges from 0 to
              360 degrees. The mean anomaly is referenced to the perigee. If the satellite
              were at the perigee, the mean anomaly would be 0.

          mean_motion: The constant angular speed required for the body to complete one circular orbit
              in the same amount of time as the actual elliptical orbit with variable speed.
              Measured in revolutions per day.

          mean_motion_d_dot: 2nd derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day cubed.

          mean_motion_dot: 1st derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day squared.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          perigee: The orbit point nearest to the center of the earth in kilometers.

          period: Period of the orbit equal to inverse of mean motion.

          raan: Right ascension of the ascending node, or RAAN is the angle as measured in
              degrees eastwards (or, as seen from the north, counterclockwise) from the First
              Point of Aries to the ascending node, which is where the orbit crosses the
              equator when traveling north.

          rev_no: The current revolution number. The value is incremented when a satellite crosses
              the equator on an ascending pass.

          semi_major_axis: The sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances divided by two. For circular
              orbits, the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies,
              not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass.

        Please contact the UDL team for assistance.

        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          epoch: Elset epoch time in ISO 8601 UTC format, with microsecond precision.

          id_manifold: Identifier of the parent Manifold record.

          source: Source of the data.

          tmp_sat_no: A placeholder satellite number and not a true NORAD catalog number.

          body_id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          apogee: The Orbit point furthest from the center of the earth in kilometers.

          arg_of_perigee: The argument of perigee is the angle in degrees formed between the perigee and
              the ascending node. If the perigee would occur at the ascending node, the
              argument of perigee would be 0.

          b_star: The drag term for SGP4 orbital model, used for calculating decay constants for
              altitude, eccentricity etc, measured in inverse earth radii.

          eccentricity: The orbital eccentricity of an astronomical object is a parameter that
              determines the amount by which its orbit around another body deviates from a
              perfect circle. A value of 0 is a circular orbit, values between 0 and 1 form an
              elliptic orbit, 1 is a parabolic escape orbit, and greater than 1 is a
              hyperbolic escape orbit.

          inclination: The angle between the equator and the orbit when looking from the center of the
              Earth. If the orbit went exactly around the equator from left to right, then the
              inclination would be 0. The inclination ranges from 0 to 180 degrees.

          mean_anomaly: Where the satellite is in its orbital path. The mean anomaly ranges from 0 to
              360 degrees. The mean anomaly is referenced to the perigee. If the satellite
              were at the perigee, the mean anomaly would be 0.

          mean_motion: The constant angular speed required for the body to complete one circular orbit
              in the same amount of time as the actual elliptical orbit with variable speed.
              Measured in revolutions per day.

          mean_motion_d_dot: 2nd derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day cubed.

          mean_motion_dot: 1st derivative of the mean motion with respect to time. Units are revolutions
              per day squared.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          perigee: The orbit point nearest to the center of the earth in kilometers.

          period: Period of the orbit equal to inverse of mean motion.

          raan: Right ascension of the ascending node, or RAAN is the angle as measured in
              degrees eastwards (or, as seen from the north, counterclockwise) from the First
              Point of Aries to the ascending node, which is where the orbit crosses the
              equator when traveling north.

          rev_no: The current revolution number. The value is incremented when a satellite crosses
              the equator on an ascending pass.

          semi_major_axis: The sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances divided by two. For circular
              orbits, the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies,
              not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass.
