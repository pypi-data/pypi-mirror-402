              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and

              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          id_antenna: Unique identifier of the parent Antenna.

          source: Source of the data.
