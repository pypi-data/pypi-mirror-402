          cntct: Contact information for assets reporting PPLI (Precise Participant Location and
              Identification). PPLI is a Link 16 message that is used by units to transmit
              complete location, identification, and limited status information.

          conf: POI confidence estimate (not standardized, but typically a value between 0 and
              1, with 0 indicating lowest confidence.

          desc: Description of the POI target object.

          el: Target object pointing elevation angle, in degrees (for target with sensing or
              emitting capability).

              semi-minor axis (m), orientation (deg) off true North at POI].

          env: POI environment type (e.g., LAND, SURFACE, SUBSURFACE, UNKNOWN, etc.).

          groups: Optional array of groups used when a POI msg originates from a TAK server. Each
              group must be no longer than 256 characters. Groups identify a set of users
              targeted by the cot/poi msg.

          how: How the event point was generated, in CoT object heirarchy notation (optional,
              CoT).

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          plat: POI/object platform type (e.g., 14/GROUND, COMBAT_VEHICLE, etc.).

          pps: The purpose of this Point of Interest record (e.g., BDA, EQPT, EVENT, GEOL,

              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size. See the corresponding srcTyps
              array element for the data type of the UUID and use the appropriate API
              operation to retrieve that object (e.g. /udl/rfobservation/{uuid}).

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types (GROUNDIMAGE, RFOBS) that are related to the
              determination of this Point of Interest. See the associated 'srcIds' array for
              the record UUIDs, positionally corresponding to the record types in this array.
              The 'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size.

          stale: Stale timestamp (optional), in ISO8601 UTC format.

          start: Start time of event validity (optional), in ISO8601 UTC format.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.

          trkid: Optional ID of an associated track related to the POI object, if applicable.

              service.

          type: Event type, in CoT object heirarchy notation (optional, CoT).

          urls: List of URLs to before/after images of this Point of Interest entity.

          groups: Optional array of groups used when a POI msg originates from a TAK server. Each
              group must be no longer than 256 characters. Groups identify a set of users

              POI. Each element in array must be 36 characters or less in length.

          lat: WGS-84 latitude of the POI, in degrees (+N, -S), -90 to 90.

          le: Height above lat/lon point, in meters (1-sigma, if representing linear error).

          lon: WGS-84 longitude of the POI, in degrees (+E, -W), -180 to 180.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          plat: POI/object platform type (e.g., 14/GROUND, COMBAT_VEHICLE, etc.).

          pps: The purpose of this Point of Interest record (e.g., BDA, EQPT, EVENT, GEOL,

              this Point of Interest. See the associated 'srcTyps' array for the specific
              types of data, positionally corresponding to the UUIDs in this array. The
              'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size. See the corresponding srcTyps
              array element for the data type of the UUID and use the appropriate API
              operation to retrieve that object (e.g. /udl/rfobservation/{uuid}).

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types (GROUNDIMAGE, RFOBS) that are related to the
              determination of this Point of Interest. See the associated 'srcIds' array for
              the record UUIDs, positionally corresponding to the record types in this array.
              The 'srcTyps' and 'srcIds' arrays must match in size.

          stale: Stale timestamp (optional), in ISO8601 UTC format.

          start: Start time of event validity (optional), in ISO8601 UTC format.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

          transaction_id: Optional identifier to track a commercial or marketplace transaction executed to
              produce this data.
