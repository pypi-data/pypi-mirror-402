              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              datasets.

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          altitude_blocks: Minimum and maximum altitude bounds for the track.

          apn_setting: The APN radar code sent and received by the aircraft for identification.

              with millisecond precision.

          external_id: Optional air refueling track ID from external systems. This field has no meaning
              within UDL and is provided as a convenience for systems that require tracking of

        Args:
          classification_marking: Classification marking of the data in IC/CAPCO Portion-marked format.

          data_mode:
              Indicator of whether the data is REAL, TEST, EXERCISE, or SIMULATED data:

              REAL:&nbsp;Data collected or produced that pertains to real-world objects,
              events, and analysis.

              TEST:&nbsp;Specific datasets used to evaluate compliance with specifications and
              requirements, and for validating technical, functional, and performance
              characteristics.

              EXERCISE:&nbsp;Data pertaining to a government or military exercise. The data
              may include both real and simulated data.

              SIMULATED:&nbsp;Synthetic data generated by a model to mimic real-world
              datasets.

          last_update_date: The last updated date of the track route in ISO 8601 UTC format with millisecond
              precision.

          source: Source of the data.

          type: The track route type represented by this record (ex. AIR REFUELING).

          id: Unique identifier of the record, auto-generated by the system.

          altitude_blocks: Minimum and maximum altitude bounds for the track.

          apn_setting: The APN radar code sent and received by the aircraft for identification.

          apx_beacon_code: The APX radar code sent and received by the aircraft for identification.

              with millisecond precision.

          external_id: Optional air refueling track ID from external systems. This field has no meaning
              within UDL and is provided as a convenience for systems that require tracking of
              an internal system generated ID.

          last_used_date: Used to show last time the track route was added to an itinerary in ISO 8601 UTC
              format with millisecond precision.

          location_track_id: Track location ID.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          poc: Point of contacts for scheduling or modifying the route.

          pri_freq: The primary UHF radio frequency used for the track route in megahertz.

          receiver_tanker_ch_code: The receiver tanker channel identifer for air refueling tracks.

          review_date: Date the track needs to be reviewed for accuracy or deletion in ISO 8601 UTC
              format with millisecond precision.

          route_points: Points identified within the route.

          scheduler_org_name: Point of contact for the air refueling track route scheduler.

          scheduler_org_unit: The unit responsible for scheduling the track route.

          sec_freq: The secondary UHF radio frequency used for the track route in megahertz.

          short_name: Abbreviated name of the track.

          sic: Standard Indicator Code of the air refueling track.

          track_id: Identifier of the track.

          track_name: Name of the track.

          type_code: Type of process used by AMC to schedule an air refueling event. Possible values
              are A (Matched Long Range), F (Matched AMC Short Notice), N (Unmatched Theater
              Operation Short Notice (Theater Assets)), R, Unmatched Long Range, S (Soft Air
              Refueling), T (Matched Theater Operation Short Notice (Theater Assets)), V
              (Unmatched AMC Short Notice), X (Unmatched Theater Operation Short Notice (AMC
