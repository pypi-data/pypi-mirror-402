    for OnOrbit objects. State vectors are cartesian vectors of position (r) and
    velocity (v) that, together with their time (epoch) (t), uniquely determine the
    trajectory of the orbiting body in space. J2000 is the preferred coordinate
    frame for all state vector positions/velocities in UDL, but in some cases data
    may be in another frame depending on the provider and/or datatype. Please see
    the 'Discover' tab in the storefront to confirm coordinate frames by data
    provider.
