Captain's Log: High-authority Pylint module for enforcing **Prime Directives** (Clean Architecture) and preventing **Hull Integrity Breaches** (Technical Debt) in Python projects.

Enforcing architectural boundaries, dependency rules, and design patterns to ensure the fleet remains operational and modular.

## Features

*   **Layer Boundary Enforcement**: Ensures Prime Directives are maintained between Domain, UseCase, and Infrastructure.
*   **The Silent Core Rule (W9013)**: Guarantees that Domain/UseCase layers remain free of `print`, `logging`, and console I/O, forcing delegation to Interfaces/Adapters.
*   **Dependency Injection Checks**: Forbids unauthorized instantiation of infrastructure modules within UseCases.
*   **Design Pattern Enforcement**: Detects "naked returns" and other architectural anomalies.
*   **Law of Demeter**: Prevents tight coupling through deep method chains.
*   **Contract Integrity**: Verifies that Infrastructure implements Domain Protocols correctly.
*   **Anti-Bypass Guard**: Prevents "lazy" disabling of Prime Directives without high-level authorization (Justification).

## Docking Procedures

```bash
pip install pylint-clean-architecture
```

## Flight Manual

Add the plugin to your `pyproject.toml` or Pylint configuration:

```toml
[tool.pylint.main]
load-plugins = ["clean_architecture_linter"]
```

Run Pylint as usual:

```bash
pylint src/
```

### AI Coding Assistant Support

The `clean-arch-init` command generates architectural instructions for AI agents (like Cursor or GitHub Copilot) to prevent "Split Brain" issues by teaching the AI your project's rules before it writes code.

Usage:

```bash
clean-arch-init
```

Outcome: This creates a customized `.agent/instructions.md` file based on the layer names defined in the project's `Console Calibration`.


## Console Calibration

The module is calibrated via `[tool.clean-arch]` in `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
[tool.clean-arch]
# 1. Project Type Presets (generic, cli_app, fastapi_sqlalchemy)
project_type = "generic"

# 2. Strict Visibility Enforcement
visibility_enforcement = true

# 3. Silent Core Calibration
silent_layers = ["Domain", "UseCase"]
allowed_io_interfaces = ["TelemetryPort", "LoggerPort"]

# 4. Shared Kernel (Allow cross-cutting concerns anywhere)
shared_kernel_modules = ["logging_utils", "clean_architecture_linter.interface.telemetry"]

# 5. Custom Layer Mapping (Map directory regex patterns to layers)
[tool.clean-arch.layer_map]
"services" = "UseCase"
"infrastructure/clients" = "Infrastructure"
"domain/models" = "Domain"
```

## Prime Directives

See [RULES.md](RULES.md) for a complete catalog of enforced Prime Directives and "Clean Fix" examples.
