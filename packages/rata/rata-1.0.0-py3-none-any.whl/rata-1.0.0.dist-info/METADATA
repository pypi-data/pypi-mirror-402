# rata: raw time tracker

Painless interactive terminal time tracker with git versioning running on python 3 and urwid.

What I disliked in other terminal time trackers was that I had to use complicated key strokes or type commands to
start/stop and switch between tasks. I wanted single-key actions, fast switching and typing only for naming tasks.

## Demo screencast

It suits people who only want to track the name, duration, start and end time of tasks they worked on, e.g. for billing
a project per hour.

It's my first urwid project and there is no test coverage. Use at own risk, though it commits all changes directly to
git. So you should always be able to recover your entries.

## Features

- runs in the terminal and adjusts to terminal size
- track time per task in a single JSON file
- quickly change between, add and rename tasks
- shows when you started tracking, since when you are tracking and total duration tracked per task
- edit previous records with check for overlaps
- keep track of all changes through automatic git commits
- sort by duration/name/most recently worked on (default: most recent)
- status line shows total, today, yesterday, and current week hours
- JSON file format for easy parsing and integration

## Installation

`pip install rata`

Or to install the latest master, clone this repo and run this command in the project root folder:

`pip install --upgrade .`

## Usage

rata requires a file name in a git-versioned folder. It will create a new commit for any change.

````
git init ~/timerecords
rata ~/timerecords/projectFoo.json

or if you want to see how much you will have to bill:

RATE=<hourly rate> rata ~/timerecords/projectFoo.json

````
I would strongly recommend to not keep other files than what rata creates in the repository as it runs `git reset` before committing and may mess with your git stage.

The file format changed from org-mode to JSON. Existing org-mode files need to be converted.
