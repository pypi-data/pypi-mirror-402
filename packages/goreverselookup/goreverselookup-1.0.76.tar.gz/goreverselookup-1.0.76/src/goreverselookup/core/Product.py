        Fetches the ortholog for this product. If the ortholog query was successful, then self.genename is updated to the correct human ortholog gene name.

          - (ModelSettings) model_settings: isn't implemented, as this function is outdated. Use this function to check _d_compare_goaf!

        Algorithm:
            If there is only one id_synonym (eg. UniProtKB:Q9NTG7) and that id_synonym is of type UniProtKB, then
            UniProtAPI is used to obtained information about this gene. A successful query returns a dictionary, which also
            contains the genename field (which updates self.genename to the queried genename)

            If there is only one id_synonym and it is not of type UniProtKB, then HumanOrthologFinder is used to attempt a file-based
            search for the ortholog (files from all the third party databases are used).

            The user also has an option to supply a GO Annotations File and direct the program to first browse the GOAF and the 3rd party
            database files for orthologs ("offline" approach) using the prefer_goaf parameter. By default, if a GOAF is provided, it will be preferably used.

            If the file-based search doesn't work, then EnsemblAPI is used as a final attempt to find a human ortholog. The first call (ensembl_api.get_human_ortholog)
            returns an ensg_id, which is then used in another call to ensembl_api.get_info in order to obtain the gene name from the ensg_id.

            TODO: If there are multiple id_synonym(s), currently only the first is browsed. Implement logic for many id_synonyms / check if there are any products with multiple id synonyms.

        Fetches the ortholog for this product. If the ortholog query was successful, then self.genename is updated to the correct human ortholog gene name.
        Additionally, during the course of fetch_ortholog, ensembl_api.get_info may be called - if this happens, then the values description, ensg_id, enst_id, refseq_nt_id, uniprot_id are
        also filled out for this Product from the ensembl_api.get_info return value.

        Parameters:
          - (HumanOrthologFinder) human_ortholog_finder
          - (UniProtAPI) uniprot_api
          - (EnsemblAPI) ensembl_api
          - (GOAnnotationsFile) goaf
          - (bool) prefer_goaf: see explanation in the Algorithm section
          - (bool) _d_compare_goaf: if true, will attempt ortholog search both from offline and online algorithms and report if the results are the same
          - (ModelSettings) model_settings: the settings of the model. Currently, model_settings.uniprotkb_genename_online_query is used, which determines if gene name querying from a UniProtKB id is done via a web request or via GOAF

        Algorithm:
            If there is only one id_synonym (eg. UniProtKB:Q9NTG7) and that id_synonym is of type UniProtKB, then
            UniProtAPI is used to obtained information about this gene. A successful query returns a dictionary, which also
            contains the genename field (which updates self.genename to the queried genename)

            If there is only one id_synonym and it is not of type UniProtKB, then HumanOrthologFinder is used to attempt a file-based
            search for the ortholog (files from all the third party databases are used).

            The user also has an option to supply a GO Annotations File and direct the program to first browse the GOAF and the 3rd party
            database files for orthologs ("offline" approach) using the prefer_goaf parameter. By default, if a GOAF is provided, it will be preferably used.

            If the file-based search doesn't work, then EnsemblAPI is used as a final attempt to find a human ortholog. The first call (ensembl_api.get_human_ortholog)
            returns an ensg_id, which is then used in another call to ensembl_api.get_info in order to obtain the gene name from the ensg_id.

            TODO: If there are multiple id_synonym(s), currently only the first is browsed. Implement logic for many id_synonyms / check if there are any products with multiple id synonyms.
