class adv_product_score(Metrics):
    """
    An advanced scoring algorithm, an implementation of the Metrics interface. It takes in  a model (in the form of a ReverseLookup object)
    and several parameters (a, b1, b2, c1, c2) in it's constructor, which are used to tune the weights given to different aspects of the scoring algorithm.

    Parameters:
      - (ReverseLookup) model: an instance of the ReverseLookup model.
      - (float) a: is used to give a base score to a product when all target SOIs are regulated in the same direction as the GOTerms in the list.
      - (float) b1, b2: are used to calculate the score based on the number of SOIs in target_SOIs that are regulated by GOTerms in the same (b1) or opposite (b2) direction as defined in the list.
      - (float) c1, c2: are used to adjust the score based on the number of GOTerms with direction "0"

    Scoring algorithm (explanation of the metric function):
      1. Start with score = 0.0

      2. (a) If all GO Terms of a Product instance regulate the SOIs of the ReverseLookup instance (eg. angio, diabetes) positively (and none negatively), then add 'a' to score. The 'direction' value of a positive regulatory term is '+', whereas direction for a negative regulatory term is '-'.

      3. (b1) For each of the SOIs, compute sum(goterm.weight) ** b2, for every GO Term of the product, which positively regulates the SOI.
         Final equation ADDED to the score is sum(b1 * sum(goterm.weight) ** b2). The first 'sum' is the sum of SOIs, whereas the second 'sum' is the sum of GO Terms, which pass the positive regulation check for the current SOI.

      4. (b2) For each of the SOI, compute sum(goterm.weight ** b2), for every GO Term of the product, which negatively regulates the SOI.
         Final equation SUBTRACTED from the score is sum(b1 * sum(goterm.weight ** b2)). The first 'sum' is the sum of SOIs, the second 'sum' is the sum of GO Terms, which pass the negative regulation check for the current SOI.

      5. (c1, c2): For the GO Terms of the product with "general" regulation (direction = 0), add a base score of c1 and add sum(c2 * goterm.weight) for every GO Term with direction = 0 (general regulation).
         Final equation ADDED to the score is score * (c1 + sum(c2 * goterm.weight)), the sum relating to the number of GO Terms with direction == 0.

    Example of calling and usage:
    1. Construct a ReverseLookup model
    model = ReverseLookup.from_input_file("diabetes_angio_1/input.txt")

    2. Create the scoring object
    adv_score = adv_product_score(model)

    3. Score the products

class fisher_exact_test(Metrics):
    """
    Fisher exact test.

    Parameters:
      - (ReverseLookup) model: an instance of the ReverseLookup model
      - (GOAnnotationsFile) goaf: an instance of the GOAnnotationsFile. If it isn't supplied, the GOAnnotationsFile from model will be used.
                                  It is advisable to not supply a custom GOAF file, since the GOAF is taken from the model.

    Note: If the setting reverse_lookup.model_settings.fisher_test_use_online_query is True (inside ModelSettings in ReverseLookup),
    then num_goterms_product_general will be determined via an https query. Otherwise, num_goterms_product_general will be determined from
    the GOAF.

    Each SOI can have 2 sets of GO terms - one set includes GO terms, which promote,
    and the other set includes GO terms which inhibit the SOI. The “general” set
    contains all GO terms in existence (found in the GOAF). Note that when supplying a ReverseLookup
    and a GOAnnotationsFile instances to the constructor, ideally they should match in their go_categories.
    If ReverseLookup and GOAF don't match in go_categories, then GOAF will be recalculated using ReverseLookup's
    go_categories.

    For each gene, we construct a contingency table and calculate the p values according
    to Fischer’s exact test.

    The gene is a candidate gene for a “positive” (stimulatory) cross section
    (eg angiogenesis + diabetes) only if p<0.05 for all stimulatory SOIs
    (angio+, diab+) and p>0.05 for all inhibitory SOIs (angio-,diab-).
    Because we calculate 2*n_SOIs (each SOI has + or - direction) p values
    for each gene, we need to calculate the final overall p value using BH correction.
    Note that BH correction is calculated in (ReverseLookup).score_products after all products have
    been scored.

    Example: consider SOI “angiogenesis+”. Let there exist 100 GO terms, which
    stimulate angiogenesis. The gene in question is SOX2, which is associated in 10
    of the 100 GO terms of angiogenesis+. Gene SOX2 is also associated with 100 GO
    terms in the “general” set (containing all existing GO terms - 10000 GO terms).
    
    Note:
    - interest count = num_goterms_product_SOI
