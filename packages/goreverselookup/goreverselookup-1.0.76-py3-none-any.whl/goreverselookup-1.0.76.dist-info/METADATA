# GOReverseLookup

[![PyPI package](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip%20install-goreverselookup-brightgreen)](https://pypi.org/project/goreverselookup/) [![version number](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup)](https://github.com/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup/releases) [![Actions Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup/test_on_push.yml)](https://github.com/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup/actions/workflows/test_on_push.yml) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup)](https://github.com/MediWizards/GOReverseLookup/blob/main/LICENSE)

**GOReverseLookup** is a Python package designed for Gene Ontology Reverse Lookup. It serves the purpose of identifying statistically significant genes within a set or a cross-section of selected Gene Ontology Terms. Researchers need only define their own states of interest (SOIs), and select GO terms must be attributed as either positive or negative regulators of the chosen SOIs. For more information regarding the creation of the input file for the program, refer to the _Input file_ section. Once the input file is created, the GOReverseLookup program can be started. Once the algorithm is completed, the program saves statistically significant genes in a standalone file.

For example, if researchers were interested in the _angiogenesis_ SOI, then an attributed group of GO terms as positive regulators of _angiogenesis_ might have been defined using the following GO terms:
- GO:1903672 positive regulation of sprouting angiogenesis
- GO:0001570 vasculogenesis
- GO:0035476 angioblast cell migration

And negative regulators of the _angiogenesis_ SOI might have been defined as the following group:
- GO:1903671 negative regulation of sprouting angiogenesis
- GO:1905554 negative regulation of vessel branching
- GO:0043537 negative regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration

If a researcher defines the _target process_ as positive regulation of a desired SOI (in our case _angiogenesis_), then GOReverseLookup finds all genes statistically relevant for the group of GO terms defined as positive regulators of _angiogenesis_ (p < 0.05) while excluding any genes determined to be statistically significant (_p_ < 0.05) in the opposing process (in our case, negative regulation of _angiogenesis_). _P_-value threshold can also be manually set by the user.


## Getting Started
This section instructs you how to install the GOReverseLookup package and its prerequisites.

### Folder setup
You MUST create a local folder anywhere on your disk, which will be used as the GOReverseLookup's working environment, as well as unified storage for all of your research projects. We advise you to create a folder structure with a folder named `goreverselookup` as the parent folder (this folder will be used as a local installation location for the GOReverseLookup program), and a subfolder named `research_models`, where you will store the input files for GOReverseLookup and their results. Therefore, the folder structure should be the following:
```
.../goreverselookup/
    - research_models/
```

### Installation
#### Python installation
For your computer to understand the GOReverseLookup program, it requires the Python programming language, which MUST be installed. Our program is currently tested on Python versions 3.10.x through 3.11.x, but not yet on 3.12.x. Thus, we advise you to use the Python version 3.11.5, which is available for download from [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/). Following this link, navigate to the _Files_ section:
- if you are using Windows: download _Windows installer (64-bit)_
- if you are using macOS: download _macOS 64-bit universal2 installer_

![github python Files section](https://i.ibb.co/kXLg2QD/goreverselookup-pyth.png)

Open the File Explorer program, then open the Downloads folder and run the installer by double clicking it.

![downloads folder](https://i.ibb.co/8xFzpjY/github-downloads-folder.png)
![python installer](https://i.ibb.co/JcnB96N/github-pyinstall.png)

The default Python installer window pops up:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/YR8qZMc/github-pyinstaller-greet.png" width="450">

**Make sure** to also select **Add python.exe to PATH**. This will make Python available across all-file locations, which is of extreme importance for running Python commands from the console (Command prompt in Windows). Then, click on **Install Now**. A further observation of the installer's window also reveals that this installer is bundled with PIP (Python's package manager), thus manual installation of PIP won't be necessary. This is important, since PIP will be used to download GOReverseLookup.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5R9TrxP/github-pyinstaller-addpath.png" width="450">

Wait for the installation of Python to finish. Once it is finished, close the installer window.

If you wish to download a specific Python version, browse through the [Python's downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - for beginners, we advise you to find a release with an available installer. 

Then, open the command prompt using the Windows search bar:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/PjkK65L/github-cmd.png" width="450">

Inside the command prompt, execute the command `python --version`. If Python installation has been completed successfully, a version of the Python programming language will be displayed:

![github cmd python version](https://i.ibb.co/RY55LKv/github-cmd-pyvers.png)

Also verify that PIP (Python's package manager) is installed. In our instance, it has been mentioned in the Python installer's window that PIP will also be installed along with Python. To verify the installation of PIP, run the `pip --version` command:

![cmd pip version](https://i.ibb.co/NFNgL40/github-cmd-pipvers.png)

#### Creating your GOReverseLookup workspace
To create a standalone GOReverseLookup workspace that will be central both to GOReverseLookup's installation files and the research files, create the folder setup as instructed in _Folder setup_. Create a Python's virtual environment in the `goreverselookup` folder using the command `python -m venv "PATH_TO_GOREVERSELOOKUP"`. For example, on my computer, the `goreverselookup` folder exists at `F:\Development\python_environments\goreverselookup`, thus the command to create the virtual environment is: `python -m venv "F:\Development\python_environments\goreverselookup"`:

![pyvenv](https://i.ibb.co/3pNDHF0/github-pyvenv.png)

To find the path to your goreverselookup folder, open the goreverselookup folder in the File Explorer and click on the Address Bar, then copy the filepath.

![goreverselookup file explorer path 1](https://i.ibb.co/f2qp6Lr/github-fe-goreverselookup.png)

![goreverselookup file explorer path 2](https://i.ibb.co/3dwZkyd/github-fe-adrbar.png)

After running the virtual environment creation command, you should notice the goreverselookup folder be populated with new folders: `Include`, `Lib` and `Scripts`, and a file named `pyvenv.cfg`. These belong to the newly created Python's virtual environment, so do not change their contents in any way. As stated in the _Folder setup_ section, the goreverselookup folder also contains a `research_models` folder.

![goreverselookup folder after pyvenv](https://i.ibb.co/D7MfZVv/github-grvfolder-after-pyvenv.png)

To activate the newly created virtual environment, there exists an activation script named `activate.bat` in the newly created `Scripts` folder. You will need to activate this virtual environment in command prompt every time you begin working with GOReverseLookup, thus we advise you to save the activation command in a text file somewhere easily accessible, such as your desktop. To activate the virtual environment, just supply the path to the activation script to the command prompt - in our case, the path to the activation script is `F:\Development\python_environments\goreverselookup\Scripts\activate`. After running this in command prompt, the virtual environment will be activated:

![goreverselookup venv activation](https://i.ibb.co/Gx7g8kF/github-venvactivation.png)

#### Installing GOReverseLookup
As per instructions in _Creating your GOReverseLookup workspace_, activate the newly created virtual environment, so the current command prompt pointer points to the virtual environment. E.g.:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Gx7g8kF/github-venvactivation.png" width="350">

Now, run the command `pip install goreverselookup` and wait for the installation to complete:

![goreverselookup pip install](https://i.ibb.co/T2drrGF/github-goreverselookup-install-pip.png)

To confirm the installation, run the command `pip list` and find the `goreverselookup` package, along with it's version:

![goreverselookup pip list](https://i.ibb.co/R99Rp9H/github-pip-list.png)


## Usage
### Creating the input file
The entry to the program is an input file, which is ideally placed in the `.../goreverselookup/research_models/` folder, as explained in _Folder setup_. It contains all the relevant data for the program to complete the analysis of statistically important genes that positively or negatively contribute to one or more states of interest.

An example input.txt file to discover the genes that positively contribute to both the development of chronic inflammation and cancer is supplied below.

WARNING: This is just an example input file intended to give a quick overview of the general contents of an input file. It is not meant to be used in an analysis, as it contains far too few GO terms to discover any potential genes. To test if your program setup works, use research-grade input files, which are located in the `research_models` folder, e.g. `research_models/chronic-inflammation_cancer/IEA+/ind_ann,p=0.05,IEA+ (145)/input.txt`.

```
The main role of the researcher is to establish one or more custom states of interest (SOIs) and then attribute specific GO terms to the SOIs. Thus, SOIs and GO term attributions will be covered first.

#### Creating SOIs (states_of_interest section)
States of interest are created in the `states_of_interest` section. A SOI represents a name of a specific state of interest. Besides the name, either `+` or `-` is added in the line beside the SOI name in order to specify whether the researcher is interested in finding genes responsible for the positive contribution (stimulation) of the SOI or the negative contribution (inhibition) of the SOI.

For example, when a researcher observes increased capillary growth in a histological sample, an SOI could be `angiogenesis    +`. Strictly speaking, an SOI is only `angiogenesis`, whereas the `+` or `-` represents the stimulation or inhibition of the SOI. When both the SOI and the direction of regulation of that SOI are specified in the `states_of_interest`, this is termed a **target SOI**.

#### Attributing GO terms to SOIs (GO_terms section)
After SOIs have been created, they need to be attributed with GO terms to specifically define them. SOIs can have GO terms attributed both for stimulation (`+`) or inhibition (`-`) of the SOI, irrespective of the defined target SOIs in the _states_of_interest section_. GO terms are attributed to SOIs in the `GO_terms` section, by first specifying a `GO term id`, followed by the `SOI`, the impact of the GO term on the SOI (`+ or -`), a `weight` (this is historical and is kept at 1) and a `description of the GO term`.

Example: A researcher defined an `angiogenesis` SOI. Now, the researcher can assign GO terms that positively and negatively stimulate angiogenesis such as:
```
GO:0016525	angio	-	1	negative regulation of angiogenesis
GO:0045766	angio	+	1 	positive regulation of angiogenesis
GO:0043534	angio	+	1	blood vessel endothelial cell migration
GO:0043532	angio	-	1	angiostatin binding
```
With a defined SOI(s) and attributed GO terms, you can actually run the analysis and leave the other options at defaults. Other sections are explained in the following text.

#### Evidence code groups section
Evidence codes are three- or two-letter codes providing a specific level of proof for an annotation between a GO term and a specific gene. This section contains the whole hierarchy of possible evidence codes, grouped into several major evidence code groups (EGCs). This section only determines the possible EGCs and specific evidence codes, whereas the EGCs or specific evidence codes are selected in the _Settings_ section via the `evidence_codes` setting. 

Based on https://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes/, there are the following 6 EGCs (noted with belonging evidence codes):
1. experimental evidence (EXP, IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP, HTP, HDA, HMP, HGI, HEP)
1. phylogenetically inferred evidence (IBA, IBD, IKR, IRD)
1. computational analysis evidence (ISS, ISO, ISA, ISM, IGC, RCA)
1. author statement evidence (TAS, NAS)
1. curator statement evidence (IC, ND)
1. electronic annotation (IEA)

Of important notice is that approximately 95% of Gene Ontology annotations are electronically inferred (IEA) and these are not checked by a human examiner.

This section exists to give user the option to add or exclude any evidence codes, should the GO evidence codes change in the future.
Each line contains two tab-separated elements:
- evidence code group name (e.g. author_statement)
- evidence codes (e.g. TAS,NAS) belonging to the group, along with their ECO identifiers (evidence code and identifier separated by underscore) as comma-separated values (e.g. TAS_ECO:0000304,NAS_ECO:0000303)

ECO evidence code identifiers can be found on https://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Guide_to_GO_Evidence_Codes and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/ECO:0000245.

WARNING: The evidence codes section MUST be specified before the settings section.

Example:
```

```

#### Settings section
The settings section contains several settings, which are used to change the flow of the algorithm. 

**evidence_codes** is used to determine which annotations between GO terms and respective genes the algorithm will accept. GOReverseLookup will only accept genes annotated to input GO terms with any of the user-accepted evidence codes. 
- to accept all evidence codes belonging to a specific EGC, use a tilde operator in brackets `(~)`, e.g. `experimental(~)`
- to accept specific evidence codes belonging to an evidence group, specify them between the parentheses. If specific evidence codes are specified among parantheses, all non-specified evidence codes will be excluded. For example, to take into account only IC, but not ND, from curator_statement, use the following: `curator_statement(IC)`
- to exclude specific evidence codes, use an exclamation mark. All evidence not specified excluded evidence codes belonging to an EGC will still be included. To exclude only HEP and retain the rest of experimental evidence codes, use: `!experimental(HEP)`
- to merge multiple evidence code groups, supply them as comma-separated values. E.g.: `experimental(~),phylogenetic(~),computational_analysis(~),author_statement(TAS),curator_statement(IC),!electronic(~)`

Example evidence codes:
```
evidence_codes	experimental(~),phylogenetic(~),computational_analysis(~),author_statement(TAS),!curator_statement(ND),!electronic(~)
```

**pvalue** is the threshold _p_-value used to assess the statistical significance of a gene being involved in a target SOI. There are two possible cases of evaluation:

a) The user has defined an SOI and has attributed GO terms that both positively and negatively regulate the SOI. A gene is statistically significant if its p-value for the defined SOI stimulation/inhibition is less than the defined p-value threshold AND its p-value for the opposite SOI (inhibition/stimulation) is greater than the defined p-value threshold. It is advisable to also attribute GO terms that are opposite regulators of the defined target SOI in order to increase the credibility of the results.

b) The user has defined an SOI and has attributed GO terms only in one regulation direction (e.g. only stimulation or only inhibition). A gene is statistically significant if its p-value for the defined SOI is less than the defined p-value threshold.

**target_organism** is the target organism for which the statistical analysis is being performed. Organisms are represented with three identifiers (separated by vertical bars), which MUST be supplied for the program to correctly parse organism data: (1) organism label in lowercase (2) organism database and (3) organism NCBI taxon. For example, to select _Homo sapiens_ as the target organism, a researcher would specify:
```
target_organism	homo_sapiens|UniProtKB|NCBITaxon:9606
```

**multiple_correction_method**: the multiple correction method used in statistical evaluation of significant genes. Default is `fdr_bh`. Must be one of the following:
- `bonferroni`: one-step correction
- `sidak`: one-step correction
- `holm-sidak`: step down method using Sidak adjustments
- `holm`: step-down method using Bonferroni adjustments
- `simes-hochberg`: step-up method (independent)
- `hommel`: closed method based on Simes tests (non-negative)
- `fdr_bh`: Benjamini/Hochberg (non-negative)
- `fdr_by`: Benjamini/Yekutieli (negative)
- `fdr_tsbh`: two stage fdr correction (non-negative)
- `fdr_tsbky`: two stage fdr correction (non-negative)

Also refer to: https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests.html#statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests 

**two_tailed**: If True, it will find significant genes at both tails of the significance curve. The chosen significant genes depend on amount of SOIs defined by the user, namely:
- if only a target SOI is defined by the researcher in the input file, without its corresponding reverse SOI (e.g. `tumorigenesis+`, denoting stimulation of tumorigenesis, without `tumorigenesis-`, denoting inhibition of tumorigenesis). Suppose `p` is set to 0.05. In this case, the program finds genes significant in the stimulation of tumorigenesis, which satisfy the condition `p(tumorigenesis+) < 0.05`. The program also artifically creates a reverse SOI (in this case, `tumorigenesis-`), finds genes which satisfy `p(tumorigenesis+) > 0.95`, and associates such genes with the reverse SOI. The output file contains both the defined target SOI (`tumorigenesis+`) and its (albeit artifically created by the program) reverse SOI (`tumorigenesis-`), along with significant genes for each SOI.
- if a researcher defined target SOIs and complementary reverse SOIs in the input file, a gene is significant, if it is significantly associated with all target SOIs (p < 0.05) and insignificantly associated with all reverse SOIs (p >= 0.05). If two-tailed setting is True, then the program also evaluates genes, which are significantly associated with all reverse SOIs (p < 0.05) and insignificantly associated with all target SOIs (p >= 0.05).

**ortholog_organisms** represent all homologous organisms, the genes of which are also taken into account during the scoring phase if they are found to have existing target organism orthologous genes. This feature has been enabled as a GO term can be associated with genes belonging to different organisms, which are indexed by various databases. The current model has been tested on the following orthologous organisms: _Rattus norvegicus_, _Mus musculus_, _Danio rerio_ and _Xenopus tropicalis_. Example:
```
ortholog_organisms	danio_rerio|ZFIN|NCBITaxon:7955,rattus_norvegicus|RGD|NCBITaxon:10116,mus_musculus|MGI|NCBITaxon:10090,xenopus_tropicalis|Xenbase|NCBITaxon:8364
```

**include_indirect_annotations**: The first parameter (True or False) determines whether to enable this setting. Enabling indirect annotations means increasing the amount of annotations to a gene by the sum of all indirectly annotated GO terms (obtained by traversing the GO term hierarchy tree using the directly annotated GO terms to the gene in question). The second parameter (`p` or `c`) determines whether to obtain indirect annotations as parents (`p`) or as children (`c`) of the directly annotated GO terms. 

As defined in GO, the "true" indirect annotations between a gene and a directly annotated GO term are the parents of the directly annotated GO term, whereas the children GO terms of the directly annotated GO term are not necessarily regulated by the gene in question. However, when studying the impact of a gene on the regulation of a given SOI, the reverse holds true - the children of the directly annotated GO term are the ones that also regulate an SOI, whereas it cannot be claimed so for the parent GO terms.

Consider the following tree:

Gene Hipk2 is directly annotated to GO:0045766. All the parent GO terms also infer the annotation to the gene Hipk2 (GO:0045765, GO:1901342, GO:2000026), but not the child terms (GO:1905555, ...). However, if the defined target SOI by the researcher is 'stimulated angiogenesis', then the GO terms responsible for the upregulation of angiogenesis are actually the children terms of GO:0045766, rather than the more non-specific parent terms. For example, the term "regulation of angiogenesis" would be faultily counted as stimulatory to angiogenesis during the gene scoring process, as it also encompasses a "negative regulation of angiogenesis" child term (among others).

The predicament in "gene influence studies" is thus whether to use parent or child terms as indirect annotations. Parent terms definitely hold the annotation to a gene of a directly annotated GO term, but are less specific in regulating a given target SOI. Child terms are more specific in regulating a given target SOI (which is desired in gene influence studies), however the connection between the child terms and the directly annotated GO term is made based on the assumption that all child terms regulate the same SOI as the directly annotated term (which the parents term might not, or might be too vaguely defined). Still, the gene in question might not be associated with any of the child terms.

Due to the aforementioned dilemma, a researcher can choose whether to count parents or children as indirect annotations.

**indirect_annotations_max_depth** takes an integer value as a parameter, with the value of `-1` meaning "infinite depth". When querying indirect annotations, specifically parent annotations, the GO terms very high in the hierarchy tree are shared across all genes in a research model (e.g. "biological regulation", "biological process", ...). To prevent such vague terms from faultily influencing the scoring process of genes, a user can set a fixed maximum depth of indirect annotations that are used for the scoring process. Consider the following example:
```
GO:0008150 biological_process
  - GO:0048731 system_development
    - GO:0001944 vasculature_development
      - GO:1901342 regulation_of_vasculature_development
        - GO:0022603 regulation_of_anatomical_structure_morphogenesis
          - GO:0045764 regulation_of_angiogenesis
            - GO:0045766 positive_regulation_of_angiogenesis
```
If the user were querying parents as indirect annotations without a maximum depth limit, all indirect annotations up to the root term would have influenced the gene statistical relevance. However, if a user set the maximum depth limit to 3 (via `indirect_annotations_max_depth    3`), then only the closest three indirect annotations would have been considered (e.g. GO:0045764, GO:0022603 and GO:1901342).

**goterm_gene_query_timeout** is the timeout it takes when querying genes annotated to GO terms. If specifying very vague GO terms (such as `regulation of gene expression`, which has ~25 million annotations, a query might fail due to a request taking too long to complete or, which is a more severe error due to its covertness, a query might return an incomplete list of genes associated with a GO term. As a rule of thumb, we discourage the usage of such vague GO terms. A default 240-second timeout ensures that all GO terms approximately with a few million annotations are fetched correctly from the GO servers.

**goterm_gene_query_max_retries** is the maximum number of retries sent to the GO servers before dropping a GO term and assigning it with an empty list of associated genes.

**gorth_ortholog_refetch**
We implemented a gOrth batch ortholog query (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/orth), which speeds up the total runtime of the program. The function attempts to find orthologs to genes in a single batch request. If 'gorth_ortholog_refetch' is True, then the genes for which orthologs were not found will be re-fetched using alternative Ensembl calls. If 'gorth_ortholog_refetch' is False, then the genes for which orthologs were not found will not be queried for orthologs again.

**gorth_ortholog_fetch_for_indefinitive_orthologs**
The gOrth batch query implementation can return the following options:
- multiple orthologous genes (these are called "indefinitive orthologs")
- a single orthologous gene (called a "definitive ortholog")
- no orthologous genes.

In our asynchronous Ensembl ortholog query pipeline implementation, when multiple orthologous genes are returned from Ensembl, the orthologous gene with the highest percentage identity (percentage identity of amino-acid sequence between the gene and the target organism orthologous gene) is selected as the best ortholog and is assigned as the true ortholog to the input gene. However, gOrth has currently (10_29_2023) no option to return the "best" orthologous gene, neither it has the option to exclude obsolete ortholog gene ids (confirmed by the gProfiler team via an email conversation). Therefore, it is advisable to keep the gorth_ortholog_fetch_for_indefinitive_orthologs to True, so that indefinitive orthologs are discarded from the gOrth ortholog query and are instead fetched by the asynchronos pipeline, which can select the best ortholog for the input gene. Having this setting set to False will choose, in the case of indefinitive orthologs, the first returned ortholog id from the gOrth query, but with no guarantees that this ortholog id is not obsolete.

**fisher_test_use_online_query**
It is highly advisable to leave this setting set to False, otherwise, the timing of the scoring phase might severely be extended (into days, if not weeks).

**uniprotkb_genename_online_query**: When querying all genes associated to a GO Term, Gene Ontology returns UniProtKB identified genes (amongst others, such as ZFIN, Xenbase, MGI, RGD). During the algorithm, gene name has to be determined. It can be obtained via two pathways:

- online pathway, using UniProtAPI
- offline pathway, using the GO Annotations File

During testing, it has been observed that the offline pathway usually results in more gene names found, besides being much faster. Thus, it is advisable to leave this setting set to False, both to increase speed and accuracy. If it is set to True, then gene names will be queried from the UniProtKB servers.

**Asynchronous settings**
Several settings influence the speed of asynchronous web requests being sent to the servers. If the speed exceeds server thresholds, however, the server may start to block incoming requests from your computer. Thus, if you experience blocking, the suggested asynchronous settings parameters are the following:
```
goterm_name_fetch_async	False
goterm_gene_fetch_async	False
goterm_name_fetch_req_delay	1.5
goterm_name_fetch_max_connections	5
goterm_gene_fetch_req_delay	0.8
goterm_gene_fetch_max_connections	5
```

#### Filepaths section
The filepaths section specifies several files that will be used during the program's runtime. Each file is represented in a single line by four parameters: (1) the file label (e.g. `goa_human`), (2) relative path to the file (e.g. `data_files/goa_human.gaf`), (3) the file download url (e.g. `http://geneontology.org/gene-associations/goa_human.gaf.gz`) and (4) the organism label pertaining to the file (e.g. `homo_sapiens`). We suggest beginner users NOT to change anything in the filepaths section. An example filepaths section is:
```
###filepaths
go_obo	data_files/go.obo	https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo	all

ortho_mapping_xenbase_human	data_files/xenbase_human_ortholog_mapping.txt	https://download.xenbase.org/xenbase/GenePageReports/XenbaseGeneHumanOrthologMapping.txt	xenopus
```
A brief explanation of the files:

**go.obo** is a Gene Ontology file representing the entire GO term hierarchy tree. It is used in the scoring phase of the GOReverseLookup's algorithm in order to obtain indirectly annotated (children) GO terms of directly annotated GO terms to a specific gene.

**goa_human.gaf** is a Gene Ontology Annotations file and represents the annotations between genes and GO terms for a specific organism. It is used during the scoring phase of the GOReverseLookup's algorithm to obtain the number of all GO terms from the entire Gene Ontology associated with a given gene for a given organism. The GAF file used in the scoring to obtain the aforementioned GO term count should be constructed for the organism, which the research investigates. Currently, only the human GAF can be used and thus GOReverseLookup is currently limited only to research for the _Homo sapiens_ species, but we plan to introduce full GAF modularity, so that the user will be able to supply a GAF file for any desired organism.

**3rd party database files** are some non-UniProtKB files that are also used for faster orthologous gene queries. Currently supported organisms are _Danio rerio_, _Rattus norvegicus_, _Xenopus tropicalis_ and _Mus musculus_. The user should not change these. The support for these database files does not limit the amount of orthologous organisms a user can add via the `ortholog_organisms` setting.

#### Categories section
Gene Ontology provides three categories of annotations (as known as Gene Ontology Aspects):
- molecular_activity
- biological_process
- cellular_component

The categories section allows you to determine which GO Terms will be queried either from online or from the GO Annotations File.
For example, when a researcher is only interested in GO Terms related to molecular activity and biological processes, querying GO Terms
related to a cellular component might result in an incorrect gene scoring process, resulting in some genes being scored as statistically insignificant, whereas they should be statistically significant. Thus, a researcher should turn off or on the GO categories according to the research goals. To turn on or off a specific GO category, provide a tab-delimited True or False value next to that category. Example:
```
###categories [category] [True / False]
biological_process	True
molecular_activity	True
cellular_component	False
```

### Running the program
Once the input file is complete, it is time to run the program using the following steps:
1. **activate the Python's virtual environment** (as instructed in _Creating your GOReverseLookup workspace_). To recap: (1) open the command-prompt (2) pass the filepath to the `.../goreverselookup/Scripts/activate` to activate your virtual environment. By activating the virtual environment, the base working directory for the program will be set to `.../goreverselookup/`. A curious reader might have observed that in the input file, data file paths are specified in relative notation (e.g. `data_files/go.obo`) - they are relative to the base working directory. By activating the virtual environment, you ensure both that the GOReverseLookup is correctly installed and that all files in use or created by the GOReverseLookup program are saved to the `.../goreverselookup/` folder. The result of activation should look something like this:

![goreverselookup venv activation](https://i.ibb.co/Gx7g8kF/github-venvactivation.png)

2. **switch the command prompt's current working directory (CWD) to the CWD of GOReverseLookup's virtual environment**: If using Windows, use the **cd** (change directory) command to navigate to the root folder of the Python's virtual environment where GOReverseLookup is installed: `cd .../goreverselookup` (e.g. `cd C:\Users\User\Development\goreverselookup`). Setting the CWD is important, as the CWD set in the command prompt will also be the current working directory of the GOReverseLookup program. Thus, if no CWD is set and the user supplies an input file to the program (e.g. `research_models/input.txt`), the program cannot find the input file, as all relative filepath queries are performed from the CWD. Setting the CWD also ensures that the final analysis results of a GOReverseLookup analysis will be saved to a correct location.
   
3. **run GOReverseLookup** with either of the commands: `goreverselookup PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE` or `goreverselookup PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER` (e.g. `goreverselookup "research_models/input.txt"` or `goreverselookup "research_models/input.txt" "results"`). When supplying the `PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER` parameter, also create the output folder inside the `.../goreverselookup/` folder. When only the input file is specified, analysis results will be saved into the same base folder where the input file resides. Thus, if the input file resides in `...goreverselookup/research_models/input.txt`, results will be saved to `.../goreverselookup/research_models/` folder.

If you have created multiple input.txt files in your directory structure (e.g. you want to analyze multiple research models), then use the _full directory operation_ parameter, to which you pass the absolute path to the root directory, where the program should start searching for all the input.txt files:
```
goreverselookup "input.txt" --full_directory_op "C:/.../goreverselookup/"
```

If different research models share the same GO terms to SOI mappings and the same evidence codes, and the difference between them is only in the desired _p_-values or the inclusion/exclusion of indirect annotations, then you can use `--rescore True` to only use the first analyzed research model as the base model, which is scored against different scoring criteria (p-value, indirect annotations) of other research models under the same root directory. This significantly reduces runtime, since it avoids research model reanalysing. Example:
```
goreverselookup "input.txt" --full_directory_op "C:/.../goreverselookup/" --rescore True
```

5. wait for GOReverseLookup to complete the analysis

**WARNING**: When the scoring phase of the program is completed, 3-5 minutes will elapse for the saving of the cache files to complete. Do not close the command-prompt during this time, otherwise the cache files will be corrupt. Cache files are useful during recurrent runs of the program, as they prevent re-querying for the results of the same GO Terms or genes that have already been queried. 

**WARNING**: A sign of cache file corruptness are usually JSON errors that occur during the beginning of a GOReverseLookup anaylsis. You can fix this by manually deleting the cache folder located at `.../goreverselookup/cache/`.
When using asynchronous querying for GO term products, if one of the requests inside a batch of requests exceeds the 'goterm_gene_query' timeout value (one of the settings), the entire batch of product queries will fail. This usually happens when the user attempts to collect products of GO terms with millions of more annotated genes. For us, an experimental 'goterm_gene_query' timeout value that successfully queries GO terms with ~1 million annotated genes is 240 seconds.

### Analysing the program results in a text editor
When GOReverseLookup analysis is finished, two distinct JSON files will be saved:
- `data.json`: This file represents the entire knowledge about the constructed research model, with all statistically significant and insignificant genes
- `statistically_relevant_genes.json`: This file represents the discovered statistically significant genes.

We suggest downloading a rich text editor, such as **Notepad++**, which uses syntax highlighting to make the JSON files more readable and also allows the user to collapse sections of the JSON file. Example result - a statistically significant gene named `IL6` was found to be statistically relevant in stimulating chronic inflammation and cancerous cell growth:

### Generating an Excel file from the program results
Suppose the aforementioned file structure:
```
- goreverselookup/
    - research_models/
        - test_model/
            - input.txt
```
After analysis is ran by activating the `goreverselookup` virtual environment and running the command `goreverselookup "research_models/test_model/input.txt"`, a `results` folder will be saved into `test_model`, containing two files: 
- `data.json`: represents the entire research model
- `statistically_relevant_genes.json`: represents the discovered statistically significant genes (which align with the defined target SOIs specified by the research model)

Therefore:
```
- goreverselookup/
    - research_models/
        - test_model/
            - input.txt
            - results/
                - data.json
                - statistically_relevant_genes.json
```
To view the discovered statistically relevant genes, run the command `goreverselookup PATH_TO_STAT_RELEVANT_GENES --report True`, e.g. `goreverselookup research_models/test_model/results/statistically_relevant_genes.json --report True`. This will first print out a report of tab-separated-values to the console, such as:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6RG0GWW/greadme-tabsepvalues-results.png" width="450">

If you want to analyze all statistically relevant genes files in a given directory (and all subfolders), then use the _full directory operation_ command, after which you specify the root directory (the absolute path to the starting directory where the program should start traversing the file structure and thus searching for the statistically relevant genes files):
```
goreverselookup "statistically_relevant_genes.json" --report True --full_directory_op <ROOT_DIR>
```

Additionally, an Excel file will be generated inside `results`:
