**Autonomous AI Agent Loop with VibeCoder Experience**

---

## ✨ The Vibe Coder Experience

**No Code Needed.** Just describe the vibe.

Boring-Gemini features a **Universal Natural Language Router**. You don't need to remember 60+ complex tools. Just say what you want:

> "Search for authentication logic"  
> "Review my code for security issues"  
> "幫我寫測試" (Help me write tests)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (One-Click)

### 🪄 Zero-Config Wizard 
Boring features a smart setup wizard that automatically bridges your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop) with the Gemini agent.

```bash
pip install "boring-aicoding[all]"
boring wizard
```

### 💎 Smithery Integration
One-click install for Cursor/Claude Desktop.

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install boring/boring --client cursor
```

## 🔮 The Anti-Rage Revolution (V15.0.0)

V15.0.0 focuses on **UX Hardening and Resilience**, transforming Boring into a robust partner that doesn't just work, but *communicates* its progress:

- **🧠 Cognitive Architecture (System 2)**: Uses `sequentialthinking` to plan, reason, and revise before execution.
- **🐉 One Dragon Flow**: Autonomous traversal of the entire SDLC (Design → Build → Polish → Verify).
- **🔮 Predictive Intelligence**: `boring predict` and `boring bisect` catch errors before they happen.
- **🔌 Offline-First Mode**: 100% network-independent operation with local LLMs via `llama-cpp-python`.
- **🛡️ Sovereign Autonomy**: Managed tool governance (`boring policy`) and knowledge continuity (`boring bio`).
- **🩺 Self-Healing**: `boring doctor --fix` automatically repairs your environment.

## ⚡ Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Autonomous Loop** | Thinking → Coding → Testing → Fixing with System 2 reasoning. |
| 🕵️ **Context Optimization** | 80% token savings via smart chunking and semantic specificity ranking. |
| 🛡️ **Shadow Mode** | Safe execution sandbox catches destructive operations before they happen. |
| 🧩 **Natural Language** | Universal Router: "幫我寫測試" or "Fix auth bugs" triggered instantly. |
| 🧪 **Vibe Score** | Gamified health check: Lint, Security, and Docs tracked over time. |

## 📦 Usage Modes

### As MCP Server (Recommended for IDEs)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "boring": { "command": "boring-mcp" }
  }
}
```

### Managed CLI Utilities
- `boring flow`: Start the One Dragon autonomous flow.
- `boring wizard`: Bridge Cursor, Claude, VSCode, and more in seconds.
- `boring-monitor`: Fullscreen TUI dashboard for live agent monitoring.
- `boring-dashboard`: Modern web UI for project health and history.

**About `boring-route`**: This command only **shows** which MCP tool would be selected for your query. To actually execute the tool, use it in your MCP client (Cursor/Claude Desktop).
