# NEURON
NEURON is a simulator for models of neurons and networks of neuron. See [http://neuron.yale.edu](http://neuron.yale.edu) for installers, source code, documentation, tutorials, announcements of
courses and conferences, and a discussion forum.

## Installing NEURON

NEURON provides binary installers for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms. You can find the latest
installers for Mac and Windows [here](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha/). For
Linux and Mac you can install the official Python 3 wheel with:

```
pip3 install neuron
```

If you want to build the latest version from source, we support **CMake** as build system.
See detailed installation instructions: [docs/install/install_instructions.md](docs/install/install_instructions.md).

It is possible to install the Linux Python wheels on Windows via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - check the installation instructions above.

> [!NOTE]
> **About NEURON >= 9.0**: If you are experiencing compilation errors while using
> `nrnivmodl` with NEURON >=9.0, but not with previous 8.x releases, see
> [Adapting MOD files for C++ with NEURON >= 9.0](docs/guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst).
