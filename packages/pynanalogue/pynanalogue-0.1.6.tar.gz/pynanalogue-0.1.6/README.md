# `pynanalogue`

PyNanalogue = *Py*thon *N*ucleic Acid *Analogue*.

Nanalogue is a tool to parse or analyse BAM/Mod BAM files with a single-molecule focus.
We expose some of Nanalogue's functions through a python interface here.

[![Python Tests (3.9-3.14 Ubuntu & Mac), Benchmark, Linting](https://github.com/DNAReplicationLab/pynanalogue/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DNAReplicationLab/pynanalogue/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml)

A common pain point in genomics analyses is that BAM files are information-dense
which makes it difficult to gain insight from them. PyNanalogue hopes to make it easy
to extract and process this information, with a particular focus on single-molecule
aspects and DNA/RNA modifications. Despite this focus, some of pynanalogue's functions are
quite general and can be applied to almost any BAM file.

We can process any type of DNA/RNA modifications occuring in any pattern (single/multiple mods,
spatially-isolated/non-isolated etc.). All we require is that the data is stored
in a BAM file in the mod BAM format (i.e. using MM/ML tags as laid down in the
[specifications](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf)).

Common wheels (`manylinux/mac`) are available in PyPI.
Please open an issue if you want more wheels!

# Functions

Our package exposes the following python functions.
They usually have lots of optional arguments.
Among other operations, the options allow you to subsample the BAM file (`sample_fraction`),
restrict read and/or modification data to a specific genomic region (`region` or `mod_region`),
restrict by one or several read ids (`read_ids`),
a specific mapping type (`read_filter`), filter modification data suitably
(`min_mod_qual`, `reject_mod_qual_non_inclusive`) etc.
Please see each section below for the list of options, which you can access by
reading the docstring of each function.

## Peek

Quickly extract BAM file metadata without processing all records.
This function returns information about contigs (reference sequences) and
modifications present in the BAM file, making it useful for understanding
the structure of your data before running more intensive analyses.

### Documentation

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.peek.__doc__)
```

### Sample input and output

A sample execution and output follows.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
metadata = pn.peek("tests/data/examples/example_1.bam")
print(metadata)
```

The output is a dictionary with two keys: `contigs` and `modifications`.

```python
{
    'contigs': {'dummyI': 22, 'dummyII': 48, 'dummyIII': 76},
    'modifications': [['G', '-', '7200'], ['T', '+', 'T']]
}
```

The `contigs` dictionary maps contig names to their lengths.
The `modifications` list contains modification information as `[base, strand, code]` where
`+` indicates the basecalled strand and `-` indicates its complement.

## Read info

Prints information about reads in JSON.
In this section, we show how to get documentation about the function,
a sample execution, and a sample output snippet.

### Documentation

The function has lots of helpful optional arguments.
Please run the command below to see what they are.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.read_info.__doc__)
```

### Sample input and output

A sample execution and output snippet follows.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
import json
result_bytes = pn.read_info("tests/data/examples/example_1.bam")
decoded_output = json.loads(result_bytes)
```

A record from the decoded output might look like the following.
You will get one record per alignment.
```json
[
{
	"read_id": "a4f36092-b4d5-47a9-813e-c22c3b477a0c",
	"sequence_length": 48,
	"contig": "dummyIII",
	"reference_start": 23,
	"reference_end": 71,
	"alignment_length": 48,
	"alignment_type": "primary_forward",
	"mod_count": "T+T:3;(probabilities >= 0.5020, PHRED base qual >= 0)"
}
]
```

## Window reads

Output windowed modification densities of reads as a polars dataframe.
In this section, we show how to get documentation about the function,
a sample execution, and a sample output snippet.

### Documentation

The function has lots of helpful optional arguments and some required arguments
like window size and step size.
Please run the command below to see what they are.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.window_reads.__doc__)
```

### Sample input and output

A sample execution and output snippet follows.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
import polars as pl
df = pn.window_reads("tests/data/examples/example_1.bam",win = 2,step = 1)
```

The output is a polars dataframe. If printed in tsv format, a few rows may look like this.
(This was generated from a file without basecalling quality information, which is why we show 255s here).
```text
#contig	ref_win_start	ref_win_end	read_id	win_val	strand	base	mod_strand	mod_type	win_start	win_end	basecall_qual

```

### Gradient mode

The `window_reads` function supports a `win_op` parameter that controls the windowing operation.
By default, `win_op="density"` reports the modification density within each window.
Setting `win_op="grad_density"` instead reports the gradient (slope) of modification density
within each window, which can be useful for detecting transitions in modification patterns.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
df = pn.window_reads(
    "tests/data/examples/example_10.bam",
    win=10,
    step=1,
    win_op="grad_density"
)
```

The output format is identical to the density mode, but the `win_val` column now contains
the gradient value instead of the density value.

## Seq table

Extract read sequences and base qualities for a genomic region as a Polars DataFrame.
This function is useful for retrieving sequences from a particular region
with modification information overlaid. If mods are not present or the modification
probabilities are not high enough, then they are not shown.
Insertions are shown as lowercase letters, deletions as periods (`.`),
and modified bases as `Z` (or `z` for modifications in insertions).

### Documentation

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.seq_table.__doc__)
```

### Sample input and output

A sample execution follows. Note that the `region` parameter is required.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
df = pn.seq_table(
    "tests/data/examples/example_pynanalogue_1.bam",
    region="contig_00000:0-10"
)
print(df)
```

The output is a Polars DataFrame with three columns: `read_id`, `sequence`, and `qualities`.

```text
shape: (2, 3)
┌─────────────────────────────────┬────────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│ read_id                         ┆ sequence   ┆ qualities                     │
│ ---                             ┆ ---        ┆ ---                           │
│ str                             ┆ str        ┆ str                           │
╞═════════════════════════════════╪════════════╪═══════════════════════════════╡
│ xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx… ┆ ACGTACGTAC ┆ 30.30.30.30.30.30.30.30.30.30 │
│ xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx… ┆ AZGTAZGTAZ ┆ 20.20.20.20.20.20.20.20.20.20 │
└─────────────────────────────────┴────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

Sequence column conventions:
- Uppercase letters: bases aligned to reference
- Lowercase letters: inserted bases
- `.` (period): deleted bases
- `Z`: modified base on the reference
- `z`: modified base in an insertion

The qualities column contains period-separated base quality scores (0-255),
with 255 indicating a deleted position or unknown quality.

## Polars bam mods

Output raw modification data as a polars dataframe.
In this section, we show how to get documentation about the function,
a sample execution, and a sample output snippet.
Please note that as we report every modified position per molecule as a separate
row in a dataframe, the data size could get very big.
So, we recommend querying per region or subsampling the BAM file
in order to not run into memory issues -- there are options in this
function to do so.
We may develop an iterable version of this function in the future.
Please open an issue if you are interested in this, or a pull request if you can do this!

### Documentation

The function has lots of helpful optional arguments.
Please run the command below to see what they are.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.polars_bam_mods.__doc__)
```

### Sample input and output

A sample execution and output snippet follows.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
import polars as pl
df = pn.polars_bam_mods("tests/data/examples/example_1.bam")
```

The output is a polars dataframe. If printed in tsv format, it might look like this.
Mod quality is a probability represented as a number between 0 and 255,
where 0 means not modified and 255 means modified with certainty.
This is how modification data is stored in the mod BAM format.

## Simulate mod bam

If you are a developer who needs BAM files with defined single-molecule modification patterns
to help develop/test your tool, nanalogue can also help you create BAM files from scratch
using artificial data created using parameters defined by you.

```python
import pynanalogue as pn
print(pn.simulate_mod_bam.__doc__)
```

### Example

This example generates two contigs with random DNA sequences with the given properties and stores
them in a fasta file. Then, it generates a BAM file with the modification pattern and other properties
as shown. In this example, the reads are methylated, with 5Cs with a probability drawn randomly in the
range 30-70% and three Cs with a probability in the range 10%-50%. This 5C, 3C pattern repeats throughout
the read. You can then analyze this pattern with your tool and test its functionality.
You can set up multiple modifications etc. Please have a look at the documentation
[here](https://docs.rs/nanalogue/latest/nanalogue_core/simulate_mod_bam/index.html) for the options
available in the json configuration.

```python
import pynanalogue

json_config = '''
