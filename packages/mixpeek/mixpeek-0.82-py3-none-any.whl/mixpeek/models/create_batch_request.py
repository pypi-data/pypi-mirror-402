    Request model for creating a new batch.  Batches group bucket objects for processing into collections. When you submit a batch, all objects in the batch are processed through the collections associated with the bucket.  - object_ids: REQUIRED. List of object IDs that exist in the bucket - Collections are auto-discovered from the bucket at batch creation time  Batch Processing Flow: 1. Create batch with object_ids → Batch created in DRAFT status, collections auto-discovered 2. Submit batch → Processing begins for discovered collections 3. Collections with collection sources (tier 2/3) are processed automatically 4. Processing happens in topological order based on collection dependencies  Examples:     Single object batch:     {\"object_ids\": [\"obj_123\"]}      Multiple objects batch:     {\"object_ids\": [\"obj_123\", \"obj_456\", \"obj_789\"]}
