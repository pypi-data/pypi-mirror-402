    Types of user interactions with search results.  These interaction types are used to track user behavior and improve retrieval quality through Learning to Rank (LTR), collaborative filtering, and embedding fine-tuning.  Values:     VIEW: User viewed a search result     CLICK: User clicked on a search result     POSITIVE_FEEDBACK: User explicitly marked result as relevant/helpful     NEGATIVE_FEEDBACK: User explicitly marked result as not relevant     PURCHASE: User purchased the item (high-value conversion signal)     ADD_TO_CART: User added item to cart (mid-funnel signal)     WISHLIST: User saved item for later (engagement signal)     LONG_VIEW: User spent significant time viewing (dwell time)     SHARE: User shared the result (strong engagement signal)     BOOKMARK: User bookmarked the result     QUERY_REFINEMENT: User modified their search query     ZERO_RESULTS: Query yielded no results (helps identify gaps)     FILTER_TOGGLE: User modified filters (helps understand intent)     SKIP: User skipped over result to click something lower (negative signal)     RETURN_TO_RESULTS: User quickly returned to results (negative signal)  Usage in Retrieval Optimization:     - LTR (Learning to Rank): Train models to predict click-through rates     - Collaborative Filtering: Find similar users/items based on interactions     - Embedding Fine-tuning: Adjust embeddings based on what users actually click     - Query Understanding: Analyze refinements and zero-result queries     - Result Quality: Identify poorly-performing results via skip/return patterns
