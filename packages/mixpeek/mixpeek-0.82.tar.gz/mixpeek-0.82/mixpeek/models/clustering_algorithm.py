    Supported clustering algorithms.  Two types of clustering are available: 1. Vector-based: Clusters documents by embedding similarity 2. Attribute-based: Clusters documents by metadata attributes  Vector-based algorithms (require feature_vector):     - kmeans: Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance     - dbscan: Density-based clustering, finds clusters of arbitrary shape     - hdbscan: Hierarchical DBSCAN, auto-determines number of clusters     - agglomerative: Hierarchical clustering using linkage criteria     - spectral: Uses graph theory to find clusters     - gaussian_mixture: Probabilistic model assuming Gaussian distributions     - mean_shift: Finds clusters by locating density maxima     - optics: Ordering points to identify clustering structure  Attribute-based algorithm (requires attribute_config):     - attribute_based: Groups documents by metadata attributes (e.g., category, brand)
