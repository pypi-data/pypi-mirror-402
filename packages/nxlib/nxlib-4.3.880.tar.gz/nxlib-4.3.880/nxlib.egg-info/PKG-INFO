Description: > **Announcement:**
        
        With Ensenso SDK version 3.3 we stop the maintenance of our
        [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ensenso/nxlib-python-interface), since
        our SDK now includes a corresponding Python interface package. The Ensenso SDK
        can be downloaded [here](https://www.ensenso.com/download).
        
        We will continue to provide the package on PyPI, however, with a few changes:
        
        - The package is from now on named [nxlib](https://pypi.org/project/nxlib/)
        - For each new SDK release there will be a corresponding package with the same
          version number as the SDK
        - We will also publish the package under the old name
          [ensenso_nxlib](https://pypi.org/project/ensenso_nxlib) (for those who do not
          want to or cannot change their dependency list)
        
        Check our [manual](https://www.ensenso.com/python-api) for installation
        guidelines and a detailed description including some examples to get you
        started.
