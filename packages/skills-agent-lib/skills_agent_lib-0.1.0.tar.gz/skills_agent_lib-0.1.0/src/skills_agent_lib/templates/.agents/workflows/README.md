# Workflows Folder

This folder contains automation scripts and repeatable workflow templates for common tasks.

## What goes here?
- **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts for staging/production deployments.
- **Maintenance Tasks**: DB migrations, data cleanup scripts.
- **Agent Workflows**: Structured tasks that agents can pick up (e.g., "Run security audit and report").
- **CI/CD Templates**: Local versions of pipeline configurations.

## Why is this here?
Standardizing workflows ensures that complex tasks are executed consistently every time, whether by a human or an agent.
