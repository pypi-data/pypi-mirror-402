# Plans Folder

This folder is for tracking active implementation plans and RFCs (Request for Comments).

## What goes here?
- **Implementation Plans**: Step-by-step breakdowns of how a feature will be built.
- **RFCs**: Proposals for significant changes to the architecture.
- **Design Docs**: Initial thoughts and research for new modules.

## Why is this here?
Writing a plan BEFORE writing code is a core principle of agentic engineering. Agents use these plans to track progress and ensure they stay within the approved design scope.
