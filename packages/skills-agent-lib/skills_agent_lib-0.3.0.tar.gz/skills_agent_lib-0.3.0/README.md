**Portable agentic skills library for professional AI engineering.**

`skills-agent` is a CLI tool that scaffolds industry-standard `.agents` structures into any project. It imbues your AI coding assistants with project-agnostic "expertise" across the entire software lifecycle.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Initialize a new project with best-practice agent context in seconds:

```bash
# Install the library
pip install skills-agent-lib

# Scaffold the .agents structure and AGENTS.md
skills-agent init
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **23 Specialized Skills**: Out-of-the-box expertise for TDD, Security Audits, Context Engineering, and more.
- **AGENTS.md Standard**: Native support for the [agents.md](https://agents.md) open standard ("README for Agents").
- **Agentic Workflows**: Pre-defined templates for agentic loops, sub-agent coordination, and memory management.
- **Project Structure**: Scaffolds dedicated folders for `guides/`, `plans/`, and `workflows/`.
- **Portable & Modular**: Add only the skills you need for your specific tech stack.

## 📖 Directory Structure

When you run `skills-agent init`, it creates:

```text
.
├── AGENTS.md           # High-level context for AI agents
└── .agents/
    ├── skills/         # Modular expertise (SKILL.md files)
    ├── guides/         # Project-specific style & architecture docs
    ├── plans/          # Active implementation plans and RFCs
    ├── workflows/      # Automated tasks and deployment templates
    ├── prd.md          # Standard blueprint for new features
    └── status.md       # Global project state tracker
```

## 💻 CLI Commands

### Initialize Project
Scaffold the full structure including all 23 skills.
```bash
skills-agent init
```

### Minimal Scaffolding
Create the directory structure and templates without the pre-built skills.
```bash
skills-agent init --minimal
```

### List Available Skills
View the library of portable expertise.
```bash
skills-agent list
```

### Update Skills
Sync local project skills with the library and latest best practices.
```bash
skills-agent update
```

### Validate Skills
Verify skill structure, metadata, and link integrity.
```bash
skills-agent lint --local
```

## 🗺️ Future Plans

We are evolving `skills-agent` into a central hub for agentic expertise. Our upcoming roadmap includes:

- **Central Skill Registry**: A hosted platform to browse, search, and share community-verified skills.
- **Framework Integrations**: Native scaffolding for Agno, LangChain, CrewAI, and more.
- **TUI Mode**: An interactive terminal interface for selecting and managing skills.
- **Agent Self-Installation**: APIs that allow agents to autonomously search for and install the skills they need to complete a task.
