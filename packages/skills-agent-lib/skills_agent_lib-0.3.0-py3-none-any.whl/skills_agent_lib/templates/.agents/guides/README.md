# Guides Folder

This folder contains project-specific documentation and onboarding guides for both humans and AI agents.

## What goes here?
- **Style Guides**: Code formatting, naming conventions, and architectural rules.
- **Onboarding**: Step-by-step instructions for getting started with the codebase.
- **Architecture**: Deep dives into specific components (e.g., API design, Database schema).
- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**: Documentation of key technical decisions.

## Why is this here?
Agents use these guides to understand the "why" and "how" behind your project's specific implementation patterns, ensuring they don't hallucinate or provide inconsistent code.
