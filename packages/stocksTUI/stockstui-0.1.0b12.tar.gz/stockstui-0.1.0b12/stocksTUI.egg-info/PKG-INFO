# stocksTUI

A fast, minimalist terminal app for checking stock prices, crypto, news, and historical charts — without leaving your shell. Built with [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual), powered by [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), and made for people who prefer the command line over CNBC.

## ✨ Features

*   **Live-ish Price Data**
    Watch your favorite tickers update in near real-time with configurable refresh intervals.

*   **Watchlists That Make Sense**
    Organize your assets into lists like "Tech", "Crypto", "Dividend Traps", or "Memes". Manage them entirely from the UI — no need to touch JSON unless you want to.

*   **Tag-Based Filtering**
    Assign tags (e.g., `growth`, `ev`, `semiconductor`) to your tickers and instantly filter any watchlist to see only what's relevant.

*   **Charts & Tables, Your Way**
    View historical performance from `1D` to `Max`, from a table or a chart.

*   **Options Chain Support**
    View detailed options chains with strike prices, bid/ask spreads, Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega), and open interest visualization. Track your positions with quantity and average cost.

*   **News That Matters**
    See the latest headlines per ticker or a combined feed — no ads, no autoplay videos, just info.

*   **Economic Data (FRED)**
    Monitor key economic indicators directly with integration for St. Louis Fed (FRED) data. Track GDP, Unemployment, CPI, and more with rolling averages and Z-score trend analysis.

*   **Deep Market Context**
    View comprehensive asset details including All Time High (ATH), % Off ATH, PE Ratio, Market Cap, and historical performance charts.

*   **Quick Actions & Open Mode**
    Instantly edit ticker aliases and notes with `e`. Use "Open Mode" (`o`) to quickly jump to external resources or switch between news, history, and options.

*   **Keyboard-Friendly, Mouse-Optional**
    Navigate everything with Vim-style keys or arrow keys. Bonus: lots of helpful keybindings, fully documented.

*   **Custom Themes & Settings**
    Tweak the look and feel with built-in themes or your own. Set your default tab, hide unused ones, and make it feel like *your* dashboard.

*   **Smart Caching**
    The app remembers what it can. Market-aware caching keeps startup fast and avoids pointless API calls on weekends or holidays.

> ⚠️ Note: All symbols follow [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) format — e.g., `AAPL` for Apple, `^GSPC` for S\&P 500, and `BTC-USD` for Bitcoin.

## 🛠 Requirements

*   **Python** 3.10 or newer
*   **OS Support:**

    *   **Linux / macOS** — Fully supported
