# libzac - a helper function library for my daily work

## libzac.e

- `eread/ewrite/ewrite_block/...`
python wrapper of `e.exe` command line tool.

## libzac.io

- `c2np/np2c/...`
helper function for converting between numpy array and C array. Convenient for move static data between python and C.

## libzac.math

- `u2i/i2u`
converting bewteen signed/unsigned integer with arbitrary bit width.

`i4_to_i3u1/i3u1_to_i4`
converting between numpy array with dtype=i4 but contain only 24 bit data and array with 3x length and dtype=u1 that contain same data.

## libzac.dsp

- `rolling_windown/sig2frames`
function that convert a signal to frames with overlap(moving window).

## libzac.bitfield

- `class bitfield`
a C bitfield like class that can be used in python, like ctypes.Structure but with more features.

## libzac.reg

- `read_yc_reg/table2tree/...`
function that read yichip excel register table and format into pandas' Dataframe.

## libzac.plt

- `shift_factory/zoom_factory`
function that create a shift/zoom function that can be used in matplotlib.pyplot.
