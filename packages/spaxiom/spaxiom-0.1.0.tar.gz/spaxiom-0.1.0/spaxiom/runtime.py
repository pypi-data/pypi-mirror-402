"""
Runtime module for Spaxiom DSL that handles the event loop and sensor polling.

MIGRATION NOTE (as of Step 2):
------------------------------
This is the LEGACY async task-based runtime. It provides:
- start_runtime(): async entrypoint with independent sensor polling tasks
- start_blocking(): blocking wrapper for CLI usage
- shutdown(): graceful shutdown with signal handling

The NEW runtime foundation is PhasedTickRunner in spaxiom/tick.py, which
implements deterministic 4-phase tick execution per the paper specification.

PLANNED MIGRATION:
- Step 3: Add condition dependency tracking to PhasedTickRunner
- Step 4: Add Pattern integration to PhasedTickRunner
- After Step 4: start_runtime() and start_blocking() will delegate to
  PhasedTickRunner.run(), preserving backwards compatibility while using
  the new phased tick loop internally.

Until delegation is complete, both runtimes coexist:
- Use start_blocking() / start_runtime() for existing scripts and CLI
- Use PhasedTickRunner directly for new code requiring phased execution
