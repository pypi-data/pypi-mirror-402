## About The Project

**Phytospatial** is a Python toolkit designed to streamline the processing of remote sensing data for forestry and vegetation analysis. It provides tools for handling large hyperspectral rasters, validating vector geometries, and extracting spectral statistics from tree crowns. It also allows for passive-active raster-level fusion via its image processing module.

### Key Features

* **Memory-Safe Processing:** Process massive rasters using windowed reading (via `rasterio`) without overloading RAM.
* **Forestry Focused:** Specialized tools for tree crown validation and species labeling.
* **Dual-Licensed:** Available under both MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses for maximum flexibility.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get up and running quickly with `pip`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Louis-Gm/phytospatial.git
cd phytospatial
pip install -e .
```

> **New to Python?** Check out our detailed [Installation Guide](https://phytospatial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/) for Conda and Virtual Environment setup.

## Usage

Here is a simple example of extracting spectral data from tree crowns:

```python
from phytospatial import extract, loaders

# Load tree crowns
crowns = loaders.load_crowns("data/crowns.shp")

# Initialize extractor
extractor = extract.BlockExtractor("data/image.tif")

# Process
results = []
for stats in extractor.process_crowns(crowns):
    results.append(stats)
```

For a complete workflow, see the [Introduction Pipeline Tutorial](https://phytospatial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/intro_pipeline/).
