==================================

.. warning::
   **Status: Early Alpha / Active Development**

   Econox is currently in the early stages of development. The API is subject to change without notice (breaking changes).
   We recommend pinning the version in your dependencies or checking the changelog before upgrading.

   (現在、開発初期段階です。APIは予告なく破壊的な変更が行われる可能性があります。)

Econox brings the power of **Differentiable Programming** to structural econometrics.

Built on **JAX** and **Equinox**, Econox offers a **modular, Lego-like framework** that allows researchers to assemble complex structural models from interchangeable components.

By leveraging **JIT compilation** for blazing-fast simulation and **automatic differentiation** for efficient estimation, Econox reduces the research cycle from days to minutes---making structural modeling scalable, flexible, and differentiable by design.
