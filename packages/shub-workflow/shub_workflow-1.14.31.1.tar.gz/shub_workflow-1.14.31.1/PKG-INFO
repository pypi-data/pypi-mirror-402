A set of tools for controlling processing workflow with spiders and script running in scrapinghub ScrapyCloud.

# Installation

```
pip install shub-workflow
```

If you want to support s3 tools:

```
pip install shub-workflow[with-s3-tools]
```

For google cloud storage tools support:

```
pip install shub-workflow[with-gcs-tools]
```

# Usage

Check [Project Wiki](https://github.com/scrapinghub/shub-workflow/wiki) for documentation. You can also see code tests for lots of examples of usage.

# Note

The requirements for this library are defined in setup.py as usual. The Pipfile files in the repository don't define dependencies. It is only used
for setting up a development environment for shub-workflow library development and testing.


# For developers

For installing a development environment for shub-workflow, the package comes with Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files. So, clone or fork the repository and do:

```
> pipenv install --dev
> cp pre-commit .git/hooks/
```

for installing the environment, and:

```
> pipenv shell
```

for initiating it.

There is a script, lint.sh, that you can run everytime you need from the repo root folder, but it is also executed each time you do `git commit` (provided
you installed the pre-commit hook during the installation step described above). It checks code pep8 and typing integrity, via flake8 and mypy.

```
> ./lint.sh
```
