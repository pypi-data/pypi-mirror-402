# graphkit

**graphkit** is a clean, reusable Python library providing standard graph algorithms with a unified and intuitive API.

It is designed for:

* Learning and revision of graph algorithms
* Interview and competitive programming preparation
* Real-world projects requiring graph processing
* Avoiding repeated reimplementation of well-known algorithms

---

## ✨ Features

* Simple `Graph` abstraction
* Object-oriented API
* Readable and canonical implementations
* Fully testable and extensible
* No external dependencies

### Algorithms included

* Shortest Path

  * Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  * Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* Minimum Spanning Tree

  * Kruskal’s Algorithm
* Traversals

  * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  * Depth-First Search (DFS)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install pygraphkit
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from graphkit import Graph

g = Graph()

g.add_edge(1, 2, 4)
g.add_edge(1, 3, 1)
g.add_edge(3, 2, 2)

print(g.dijkstra(1))
```

**Output**

```text
{1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 1}
```

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

### Graph Abstraction

All algorithms operate on a single `Graph` class.

```python
Graph(directed=False)
```

* `directed=False` → undirected graph
* `directed=True` → directed graph

### Adding edges

```python
g.add_edge(u, v, weight)
```

* Default weight is `1`
* For undirected graphs, edges are added both ways

---

## 📐 API Reference

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Finds shortest paths from a source node (non-negative weights).

```python
g.dijkstra(source)
```

Returns:

```python
{node: shortest_distance}
```

---

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Supports negative edge weights and detects negative cycles.

```python
g.bellman_ford(source)
```

Raises:

```text
ValueError: Negative cycle detected
```

---

### Kruskal’s Algorithm

Computes Minimum Spanning Tree (undirected graphs only).

```python
mst, total_weight = g.kruskal()
```

Returns:

* `mst`: list of edges `(u, v, w)`
* `total_weight`: sum of MST edge weights

---

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

```python
g.bfs(source)
```

Returns traversal order as a list.

---

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

```python
g.dfs(source)
```

Returns traversal order as a list.

---

## 🧪 Testing

`graphkit` uses **pytest** for testing all core algorithms.

The test suite covers:

* Shortest path correctness
* Negative edge weights
* Negative cycle detection
* Disconnected graphs
* Error handling for invalid usage

Run tests locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest -v
```

All tests must pass before a release is published.
