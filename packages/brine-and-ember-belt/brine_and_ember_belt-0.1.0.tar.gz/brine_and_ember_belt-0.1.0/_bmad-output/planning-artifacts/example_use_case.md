 I'd like you to consider this real world scenario - dashi could be made with dry seaweed as it is
  mostly and traditionally done but it can be made with wet. Wet seaweed costs more carbon and money to
  transport. Dry seaweed costs money and carbon to get dry. So there are tradeoffs here. If our
  process facility is further away from our point of seaweed harvesting, then it may be best to dry it
  first. If it is close then keeping it wet and to avoid the drying cost and take advantage of the
  lower transportation costs may make the most sense. This type of question is something I'm keen to
  try to answer and build into this tool to help me answer.
