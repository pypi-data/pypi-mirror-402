You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  Selection Process: 1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for 2. Return the most relevant match based on: - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized) - Description relevance to the query's intent - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts) - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative) - Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)  Response Format: - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match."
