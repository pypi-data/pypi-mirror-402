Hey there! We're excited you're interested in using our work. Here's the deal:

You can basically do whatever you want with this software - seriously! You can use it, 
change it, share it, sell it, or even build something completely different on top of it. 
We just ask for a few simple things in return:

1. Keep this copyright notice and license with any copies you make
2. Don't blame us if something goes wrong (we tried our best, but software is tricky!)

Here's the formal legal stuff (because lawyers insist):

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

TL;DR: Use it freely, keep the license, and don't sue us. Thanks for being awesome! 🚀
