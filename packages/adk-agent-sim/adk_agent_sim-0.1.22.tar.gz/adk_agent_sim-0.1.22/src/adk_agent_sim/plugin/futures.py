"""PendingFutureRegistry - Map turn_id to Future for blocking await.

This module provides the PendingFutureRegistry class that tracks pending LLM
requests and resolves them when the human provides a response through the
simulator frontend.

Usage:
    from adk_agent_sim.plugin.futures import PendingFutureRegistry

    registry = PendingFutureRegistry()

    # In the request path
    future = registry.create("turn-123")

    # In the listen loop (when response arrives)
    registry.resolve("turn-123", response)

    # The awaiter receives the response
    response = await future

  This class maps turn_id strings to asyncio.Future objects, allowing the

  Thread Safety:
      This class is designed for single-threaded asyncio usage. All operations
      should be performed from the same event loop.
