"""SimulatorClientFactory - Factory for creating gRPC service stubs.

This module provides the SimulatorClientFactory class that manages gRPC channel
lifecycle and creates SimulatorServiceStub instances for server communication.

The factory pattern is used because betterproto's generated stub already provides
a clean API for RPC calls. The factory's role is to manage connection state and
provide properly configured stubs.

Usage:
    from adk_agent_sim.plugin.client_factory import SimulatorClientFactory
    from adk_agent_sim.plugin.config import PluginConfig

    config = PluginConfig(server_url="http://localhost:50051")
    factory = SimulatorClientFactory(config)

    try:
        stub = await factory.get_simulator_stub()
        # Use the stub for RPC calls...
        response = await stub.create_session(request)
    finally:
        await factory.close()
