# Poshcar - VASP POSCAR text editor package<br>
Author: Andy Paul Chen (MSE, Nanyang Technological University)

## Introduction
POSHCAR started as a cabin fever project during the first COVID lockdowns in the United States. It is a simple and lightweight text-based engine for generating and editing files in VASP format, which is one of the simplest and most compact descriptions of a crystal structures currently in use. The development follows an organic and modular development model where new functions are written whenever a project-specific need arises, so expect many changes as I hop from project to project.

## How to use demo file
Demo notebooks are organised into 3 parts:<br>
**Core modules:** Basic operations<br>
**Cell-building modules:** Functions that lets you generate unit cells, e.g. supercells, organic molecules, slabs<br>
**Analytics:** Functions involving statistical analysis of a unit cell, e.g. bonding behaviour<br>

The output of the demo operations can be seen in the `tests/_demo/` folder.

## Modules
Interdependencies of modules are illustrated in the diagram below. The dependency relationship is marked with arrows (dependent -> core). Please use this graph for your reference if you would like to add to Poshcar!<br><br>
