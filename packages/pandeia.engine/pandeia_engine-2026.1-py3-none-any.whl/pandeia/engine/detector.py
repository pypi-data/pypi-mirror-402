        It is very similar to romanisim/ramp.py fit_ramps_casertano_no_dq() in Roman I-Sim

        The basic difference is that the resultants, unlike JWST's groups, do not contain
        a constant number of frames. Therefore, we need to use a weighting scheme to
        accurately reproduce the noise.

        The complicated part of this is that each pixel may have a different number of
        valid resultants, and thus both nreads and ntotal are 3D arrays
        (spatial+resultants) where the third dimension is of different lengths per pixel.

        This can be handled by the unsat_resultants array containing just the number of
        unsaturated resultants - the computation is set up to stop there, per pixel.

        Worst case scenario, we can consider this function on a per-pixel basis, and run
        it X * Y times, vectorized.

        Scale the exposure time to match the SNR we want.

        To do this requires a FULL understanding of the SingleAccum noise calculation done in the 
        Strategy and Report classes, because we need to implement its reverse here.

        This is only valid for SingleAccum calculations, where the function is:
        SNR = SR / sqrt(SR/T + BR/T + DR/T + ((Rn**2 + P) * nreads * npix)/T**2)
        and
        SR = Source Rate (electrons/s)
        BR = Background Rate (electrons/s)
        DR = Dark Current Rate (electrons/s)
        Rn = Readnoise (electrons)
        P = Postflash (electrons)
        nreads = Number of independent reads
        npix = Pixels over which Readnoise and Postflash are given (as they are per-pixel 
         values still)
        T = Time (s)
        (note the differences between this and the pyetc time formula - pyetc deals in counts; 
        Pandeia deals with rates)

        Per JETC-2065, solving for T (with an expected input SNR) yields this equation:
        0 = (Rn**2 + P)*npix*nreads + (SR + BR + DR) * T - (SR/SNR)**2 * T**2
        Which is a quadratic equation, solveable in the usual way.

        The complications to this (JETC-2121) are as follows:
        1. The Strategy outputs the extracted flux rate (SR) composed of just the source rate 
           itself, and a flux_plus_bg rate composed of the source, background, dark current, WFC3 
           thermal background, and postflash (SBDPR) - everything but readnoise, which only ever
           appears as a noise term. 
           - Postflash is included as a rate in SBDPR so that it appears in the 2D signal 
             products, but it is fundamentally not a rate and must be removed from SBDPR 
             (making SBDR) so it can be re-added correctly.
           - The other components (all of SBDR) are genuine rates.
           - The noise may include an ADDITIONAL term of STIS Echelle scattering added AFTER 
             Strategy.extract(), which will need to be accounted for. It is also a rate.
        2. The correlated noise extraction in the Strategy extracts the signal and noise through 
           (effectively) different apertures. If M is the mask array, the signal extraction is 
           M * SR and and the noise extraction is M * NR * M^T (see Strategy._error_sum), which 
           is equivalent to extracting the noise through M**2, which is smaller than M.
           Example:
           If this is the mask: 0    0.5  0
                                0.5  1    0.5
                                0    0.5  0       It covers 3 pixels (0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5)
           Then the noise aperture is the above matrix squared, or this:
                                0    0.25 0
                                0.25  1    0.25
                                0    0.25 0      It covers 2 pixels (0.25 + 0.25 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.25)
           This code computes the required noise aperture size (npix_noise) and mask correction 
           factors (mask_correction), which would be 0.66667 in my simple example here.
           - Signal is NOT spatially uniform (we cannot guess what the source flux present in those
             edge pixels is), so we really do need to use an actual extraction through the noise 
             aperture (extracted['extracted_source_noise']). We also have to remove the extracted 
             signal from the extracted flux_plus_bg_rate. (SBDR-SR = BDR)
           - Background, dark current, and thermal are all spatially uniform, and thus can be 
             handled by multiplying BDR by the mask_correction factor.
           - Postflash and Readnoise are also spatially uniform and given per pixel, and need to 
             be multiplied by the number of pixels in the noise aperture.
           - We do, however, still need the real extracted signal rate for the SR/SNR term.
