The Pandeia engine is a 'simulation-hybrid' exposure time calculation engine that performs calculations on two-dimensional astronomical scenes created by the user. It uses a pixel-based 3D approach, modeling both the spatial and wavelength dimensions using realistic PSFs for each instrument mode, and handles saturation, correlated read noise, and inter-pixel capacitance. It supports both the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide-field Imager mode of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

Installation and setup instructions (including required data packages) for the Pandeia engine can be found at this Space Telescope Science Institute page: https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN/Pandeia+Engine+News
