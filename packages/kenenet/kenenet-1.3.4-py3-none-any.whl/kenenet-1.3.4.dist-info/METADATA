sucky

shitty package that i use for making coding a quicker (and hopefully less aids) process

get_pos takes the cursor position and prints the rgb when f10 is pressed

timer is a timer kjhlfdshkijlsdfhkj;sdfjkhn

debug goes at the start and end of code and prints every variable change that happened

pp is a push pull to github, quick and easy for you lazy bastard

save_img takes an array, and a name for it and saves it to a file, which automatically cleans itself

holy fuck it's nearly 3am

load_audio takes the path to an mp3 and turns it into a class, then using multiprocessing multiple versions of that audio can be played simultaneously. This comes with a default random pitch shift of (0.9-1.1) so audio sounds sexy

time_func takes a function, the amount of times you want to loop it, and its arguments, and times the amount of time it took to execute that function

time_code goes at the start and end of the code you want to time, it then prints how long each line of code and/or block (functions and loops) took to run
