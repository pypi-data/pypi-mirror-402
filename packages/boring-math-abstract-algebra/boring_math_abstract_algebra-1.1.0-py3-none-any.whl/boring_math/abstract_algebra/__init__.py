Abstract Algebra Library
------------------------

.. admonition:: Boring Math Abstract Algebra Library

    A library designed to construct concrete representations of
    abstract algebraic systems and additional non-algebraic properties
    on such.

    The term "algebra" will be used loosely to mean either an abstract
    system unique up to isomorphism, or a concrete representation of
    such a system.

.. admonition:: Future Directions

    TODO: Make separate PyPI Boring Math projects for

    - for groups

      - group actions on sets
      - Sylow tools

    - for rings

      - modules

    - for fields

      - Galois tools
