Synchronization phases for product transition system (Definition 8).

This module provides the Phase dataclasses that track synchronization
status between two transition systems in the product construction:

- Sync: Both systems are synchronized with matching labels
- ALeads: System A has moved ahead, waiting for B to catch up
- BLeads: System B has moved ahead, waiting for A to catch up  
- Error: Irrecoverable divergence detected

The phase component is critical for the stutter equivalence verification:
- The safety invariant P(A, B, phase) ≡ (phase ≠ ERROR)
- If P holds for all reachable states, the systems are stutter equivalent
