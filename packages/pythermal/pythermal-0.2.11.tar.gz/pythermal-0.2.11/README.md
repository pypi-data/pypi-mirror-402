## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install from source with automatic USB setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIoT-Infrastructure/pythermal.git
cd pythermal
pip install -e .
```

**✨ Automatic USB Setup**: When you install with `pip install -e .`, the package automatically:
- Sets up USB device permissions (copies udev rules to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`)
- Adds your user to the `plugdev` group
- Reloads udev rules

You may be prompted for your password during installation to complete the USB setup. After installation:
- Disconnect and reconnect your thermal camera
- Log out and log back in (or restart) for group changes to take effect

### Alternative: Manual USB Setup

If you prefer to set up USB permissions manually, or if automatic setup didn't work:

```bash
# After installing the package
pythermal-setup-usb
```

This command will prompt for your password and set up USB permissions manually.

### Full Setup (Optional)

For a complete setup including system dependencies (FFmpeg libraries) and native compilation:

```bash
cd pythermal
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
1. Detect your system architecture (x86_64 or ARM) and install required system dependencies (FFmpeg libraries)
2. Set up USB device permissions for the thermal camera
3. Compile the native thermal recorder (`pythermal-recorder`) for your architecture

> **Note**: The native binaries are already included in the package, so compilation is only needed if you want to rebuild them.

### Install from PyPI

Install directly on a Linux device (x86_64 or ARM, e.g., x86_64 desktop, Jetson, OrangePi, Raspberry Pi):

```bash
uv pip install pythermal
```

After installation, run `pythermal-setup-usb` to set up USB permissions.

### Optional: YOLO Detection Support

To enable YOLO v11 object and pose detection, install with the `yolo` extra:

```bash
uv pip install pythermal[yolo]
```

Or install ultralytics separately:

```bash
pip install ultralytics>=8.0.0
```

> ✅ **Bundled Native Runtime**
> The package ships with the native thermal recorder (`pythermal-recorder`) and required shared libraries (`.so` files) for both x86_64 (`pythermal/_native/linux64/`) and ARM (`pythermal/_native/armLinux/`). The library automatically detects your system architecture and uses the appropriate binaries.

## 🧠 Quick Start

### 1. Unified Capture Interface

The `ThermalCapture` class provides a unified interface for both live camera feeds and recorded sequences. It's similar to `cv2.VideoCapture` and automatically handles device initialization.

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture

# For live camera (default - uses smallest available device)
capture = ThermalCapture()  # or ThermalCapture(0) or ThermalCapture(None)

# For specific device (by consistent device ID)
capture = ThermalCapture(device_index=1)  # Use device with ID 1

# For recorded sequence
capture = ThermalCapture("recordings/thermal_20240101.tseq")

# Check for new frame
if capture.has_new_frame():
    # Get metadata
    metadata = capture.get_metadata()
    print(f"Frame {metadata.seq}: {metadata.min_temp:.1f}°C - {metadata.max_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    # Get YUYV frame (240x240)
    yuyv_frame = capture.get_yuyv_frame()
    
    # Get temperature array (96x96, uint16)
    temp_array = capture.get_temperature_array()
    
    # Mark frame as read
    capture.mark_frame_read()

# Cleanup
capture.release()
```

Or use as a context manager:

```python
with ThermalCapture() as capture:
    if capture.has_new_frame():
        metadata = capture.get_metadata()
        yuyv_frame = capture.get_yuyv_frame()
        temp_array = capture.get_temperature_array()
        capture.mark_frame_read()
    # Automatically releases on exit
```

---

### 2. Live View

Display real-time thermal imaging feed:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalLiveView

# For live camera (default)
viewer = ThermalLiveView()
viewer.run()  # Opens OpenCV window with live thermal feed

# For recorded sequence
viewer = ThermalLiveView("recordings/thermal_20240101.tseq")
viewer.run()  # Replays recorded sequence
```

**Controls:**
- Press `q` to quit
- Press `t` to toggle between YUYV view and temperature view
- Press `+`/`-` to adjust contrast (CLAHE enhancement)
- Move mouse over image to see temperature at cursor position
- Press `SPACE` to pause/resume (for recorded sequences)

The live view displays room temperature estimation in the overlay, calculated using the 5th percentile method with smoothing.

---

### 3. Record Thermal Frames

```python
from pythermal import ThermalRecorder
import time

rec = ThermalRecorder(output_dir="recordings", color=True)
rec.start()              # Starts device and begins recording
rec.record_loop(duration=10)  # Record for 10 seconds
rec.stop()               # Stop recording
```

This records both:

* Raw temperature frames (`96×96`, uint16)
* YUYV visual frames (`240×240`)
* Colored RGB frames (`240×240`, uint8 RGB) if `color=True`

---

### 4. Access Thermal Data Directly

Using the unified `ThermalCapture` interface (recommended):

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture

capture = ThermalCapture()  # Live camera, or pass file path for recorded data

# Check for new frame
if capture.has_new_frame():
    # Get metadata
    metadata = capture.get_metadata()
    print(f"Frame {metadata.seq}: {metadata.min_temp:.1f}°C - {metadata.max_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    # Get YUYV frame (240x240)
    yuyv_frame = capture.get_yuyv_frame()
    
    # Get temperature array (96x96, uint16)
    temp_array = capture.get_temperature_array()
    
    # Mark frame as read
    capture.mark_frame_read()

capture.release()
```

**Multi-Device Usage**

When multiple thermal cameras are connected, PyThermal automatically assigns consistent device IDs based on USB serial numbers. This ensures that the same physical device always gets the same ID, even after reconnection:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture

# Use device with ID 0 (first device, or smallest available)
capture0 = ThermalCapture(device_index=0)

# Use device with ID 1 (second device)
capture1 = ThermalCapture(device_index=1)

# If no device_index is specified, uses smallest available device ID
capture_auto = ThermalCapture()  # Automatically selects smallest available device

# Each device uses separate shared memory:
# Device 0: /dev/shm/yuyv240_shm
# Device 1: /dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_1
# Device 2: /dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_2
# etc.
```

**Device Mapping**

Device IDs are stored persistently in `~/.pythermal/device_mapping.json`, mapping USB serial numbers to consistent device IDs. This ensures:
- Same device always gets the same ID (even after reboot)
- Device IDs remain stable across sessions
- Automatic selection of smallest available device when `device_index=None`

**Advanced: Direct Shared Memory Access**

For advanced use cases, you can access the shared memory interface directly:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalDevice, ThermalSharedMemory

# Use specific device (by consistent device ID)
device = ThermalDevice(device_index=1)
device.start()
shm = device.get_shared_memory()

if shm.has_new_frame():
    metadata = shm.get_metadata()
    yuyv_frame = shm.get_yuyv_frame()
    temp_array = shm.get_temperature_array()
    
    # Get temperature map in Celsius (96x96, float32)
    temp_celsius = shm.get_temperature_map_celsius()
    
    shm.mark_frame_read()

device.stop()
```

---

### 5. Detect Objects in Thermal Images

Detect objects based on temperature ranges and visualize them with clustering:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture, detect_object_centers, cluster_objects

capture = ThermalCapture()  # Live camera, or pass file path for recorded data

if capture.has_new_frame():
    metadata = capture.get_metadata()
    temp_array = capture.get_temperature_array()
    
    # Detect objects in temperature range (default: 31-39°C for human body)
    objects = detect_object_centers(
        temp_array=temp_array,
        min_temp=metadata.min_temp,
        max_temp=metadata.max_temp,
        temp_min=31.0,  # Minimum temperature threshold
        temp_max=39.0,  # Maximum temperature threshold
        min_area=50     # Minimum area in pixels
    )
    
    # Cluster nearby objects together
    clusters = cluster_objects(objects, max_distance=30.0)
    
    # Each object contains: center_x, center_y, width, height, area,
    # avg_temperature, max_temperature, min_temperature
    for obj in objects:
        print(f"Object at ({obj.center_x:.1f}, {obj.center_y:.1f}): "
              f"{obj.avg_temperature:.1f}°C")
    
    capture.mark_frame_read()

capture.release()
```

See `examples/detect_objects.py` for a complete visualization example. All examples support both live camera feeds and recorded sequences using the `ThermalCapture` interface.

#### Adaptive Human Detection

Detect humans using adaptive temperature thresholds based on environment temperature:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture, detect_humans_adaptive

capture = ThermalCapture()  # Live camera, or pass file path for recorded data

if capture.has_new_frame():
    metadata = capture.get_metadata()
    temp_array = capture.get_temperature_array()
    
    # Adaptive detection (auto-estimates room temperature)
    objects = detect_humans_adaptive(
        temp_array=temp_array,
        min_temp=metadata.min_temp,
        max_temp=metadata.max_temp
    )
    
    # Or specify room temperature
    objects = detect_humans_adaptive(
        temp_array=temp_array,
        min_temp=metadata.min_temp,
        max_temp=metadata.max_temp,
        environment_temp=22.0  # Known room temperature
    )
    
    capture.mark_frame_read()

capture.release()
```

The adaptive detection uses the formula `Ts = Te + α × (Tc − Te)` where:
- `Ts` = Skin temperature (estimated body temperature)
- `Te` = Environment temperature
- `Tc` = Core body temperature (37°C)
- `α` = Blood flow regulation coefficient (0.4-0.7 for face/torso)

---

### 6. YOLO v11 Object and Pose Detection

Detect objects and human poses using YOLO v11 models:

```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture
from pythermal.detections.yolo import YOLOObjectDetector, YOLOPoseDetector
import cv2

capture = ThermalCapture()  # Live camera, or pass file path for recorded data

# Initialize YOLO detectors (default models auto-download on first use)
object_detector = YOLOObjectDetector(model_size="nano")  # Options: nano, small, medium, large, xlarge
pose_detector = YOLOPoseDetector(model_size="nano")

if capture.has_new_frame():
    yuyv_frame = capture.get_yuyv_frame()
    bgr_frame = cv2.cvtColor(yuyv_frame, cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR_YUYV)
    
    # Object detection
    objects = object_detector.detect(bgr_frame)
    for obj in objects:
        print(f"Detected {obj['class_name']} with confidence {obj['confidence']:.2f}")
    
    # Pose detection
    poses = pose_detector.detect(bgr_frame)
    for pose in poses:
        print(f"Detected person with {len(pose['keypoints'])} keypoints")
    
    # Visualize
    vis_image = object_detector.visualize(bgr_frame, objects)
    # or
    vis_image = pose_detector.visualize(bgr_frame, poses)
    
    capture.mark_frame_read()

capture.release()
```

#### Using Custom Thermal Models

Place your custom YOLO v11 models (`.pt` files) in:
```
pythermal/pythermal/detections/yolo/models/
```

**Quick usage:**
```python
# Use custom model from models directory
detector = YOLOObjectDetector(model_path="custom_thermal_object.pt")
```

📖 **For detailed instructions** on finding the models directory, uploading custom models, training, and troubleshooting, see the [YOLO Detection Guide](docs/YOLO_DETECTION.md).

See `examples/yolo_object_detection.py` and `examples/yolo_pose_detection.py` for complete examples.

## 🔌 Multi-Device Support

PyThermal supports connecting and using multiple thermal cameras simultaneously. Each device is assigned a consistent device ID based on its USB serial number, ensuring stable identification across sessions and reboots.

### How It Works

1. **Device Enumeration**: When you connect a thermal camera, PyThermal queries the USB SDK to get the device's serial number.

2. **Consistent ID Mapping**: Each unique serial number is mapped to a consistent device ID (0, 1, 2, ...) stored in `~/.pythermal/device_mapping.json`.

3. **Automatic Selection**: If no `device_index` is specified, PyThermal automatically uses the smallest available device ID.

4. **Device-Specific Shared Memory**: Each device uses its own shared memory segment:
   - Device 0: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm`
   - Device 1: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_1`
   - Device 2: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_2`
   - etc.

### Usage Examples

**Basic Usage:**
```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture

# Automatically use smallest available device
capture = ThermalCapture()

# Use specific device by ID
capture0 = ThermalCapture(device_index=0)
capture1 = ThermalCapture(device_index=1)
```

**Parallel Operation:**
```python
from pythermal import ThermalCapture
import threading

def capture_from_device(device_id):
    capture = ThermalCapture(device_index=device_id)
    while True:
        if capture.has_new_frame():
            metadata = capture.get_metadata()
            print(f"Device {device_id}: {metadata.avg_temp:.1f}°C")
            capture.mark_frame_read()

# Capture from multiple devices in parallel
thread0 = threading.Thread(target=capture_from_device, args=(0,))
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=capture_from_device, args=(1,))
thread0.start()
thread1.start()
```

**Command-Line Usage:**
```bash
# Use device 0 (default)
python examples/live_view.py

# Use device 1
python examples/live_view.py --device-index 1

# Record from device 0
python examples/record_thermal.py --duration 10

# Record from device 1
python examples/record_thermal.py --duration 10 --device-index 1
```

### Device Mapping File

The device mapping is stored in `~/.pythermal/device_mapping.json`:
```json
{
  "SERIAL001": 0,
  "SERIAL002": 1,
  "SERIAL003": 2
}
```

This ensures:
- Same physical device always gets the same ID
- Device IDs persist across reboots
- Easy identification of devices by serial number

### Troubleshooting Multi-Device Issues

* **Device ID changes after reconnection**
  - Check that USB serial numbers are being read correctly
  - Verify `~/.pythermal/device_mapping.json` exists and is writable
  - Try removing the mapping file and letting PyThermal recreate it

* **Cannot access multiple devices simultaneously**
  - Ensure each device uses a different `device_index`
  - Check that shared memory segments are unique for each device
  - Verify USB permissions are set up correctly for all devices

* **Wrong device selected**
  - Explicitly specify `device_index` instead of relying on automatic selection
  - Check the device mapping file to see which serial number maps to which ID
  - Use `enumerate_devices` helper to list all connected devices

## ⚙️ Architecture

### Native Runtime

The library uses a native binary (`pythermal-recorder`) that runs as a separate process and writes thermal data to shared memory (`/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm`). The Python library communicates with this process via shared memory for efficient zero-copy data access.

### Bundled Files

The package includes native files for both x86_64 and ARM architectures:

**x86_64 (`pythermal/_native/linux64/`):**
```
pythermal/_native/linux64/
├── pythermal-recorder      # Main thermal recorder executable
├── libHCUSBSDK.so            # Hikvision USB SDK library
├── libhpr.so                 # Hikvision processing library
├── libusb-1.0.so*            # USB library dependencies
└── libuvc.so                  # UVC library
```

**ARM (`pythermal/_native/armLinux/`):**
```
pythermal/_native/armLinux/
├── pythermal-recorder      # Main thermal recorder executable
├── libHCUSBSDK.so            # Hikvision USB SDK library
├── libhpr.so                 # Hikvision processing library
├── libusb-1.0.so*            # USB library dependencies
└── libuvc.so                  # UVC library
```

The library automatically detects your system architecture and loads the appropriate binaries.

### Shared Memory Layout

Each device uses its own shared memory segment:
- Device 0: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm`
- Device 1: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_1`
- Device 2: `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_2`
- etc.

The shared memory (`/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm` or `/dev/shm/yuyv240_shm_{device_id}`) contains:

```
Offset          Size            Content
0               FRAME_SZ        YUYV frame data (240×240×2 bytes)
FRAME_SZ        TEMP_DATA_SIZE  Temperature array (96×96×2 bytes, uint16)
FRAME_SZ+TEMP   ...             Metadata:
                                - seq (4 bytes, uint32)
                                - flag (4 bytes, uint32, 1=new, 0=consumed)
                                - width (4 bytes, uint32)
                                - height (4 bytes, uint32)
                                - min_temp (4 bytes, float)
                                - max_temp (4 bytes, float)
                                - avg_temp (4 bytes, float)
                                - reserved (4 bytes)
```

### Process Management

The `ThermalDevice` class:
1. Starts `pythermal-recorder` as a subprocess
2. Waits for shared memory to become available
3. Provides access to thermal data via `ThermalSharedMemory`
4. Automatically cleans up the process on exit

### Troubleshooting

* **`FileNotFoundError: pythermal-recorder not found`**
  Make sure you've run `setup.sh` to compile the native binaries, and that the package was installed correctly.

* **`PermissionError: pythermal-recorder is not executable`**
  Run `chmod +x` on the executable, or reinstall the package.

* **`TimeoutError: Shared memory did not become available`**
  - Check that the thermal camera is connected via USB
  - Verify USB permissions are set up correctly (run `pythermal-setup-usb` or `setup.sh`)
  - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the camera
  - Log out and log back in (or restart) after setting up USB permissions
  - Check that no other process is using the thermal camera

* **`RuntimeError: Thermal recorder process exited unexpectedly`**
  Check the process output for error messages. Common issues:
  - Camera not detected
  - Missing USB permissions (run `pythermal-setup-usb` to fix)
  - Missing shared libraries (check `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
  
* **USB Permission Issues**
  - If you get permission errors accessing the thermal camera:
    1. Run `pythermal-setup-usb` (or `sudo pythermal-setup-usb`)
    2. Disconnect and reconnect your thermal camera
    3. Log out and log back in (or restart your system)
    4. Verify with `lsusb` that your camera is detected

* **`ImportError: ultralytics package is required for YOLO detection`**
  Install the ultralytics package:
  ```bash
  pip install ultralytics
  # or
  pip install pythermal[yolo]
  ```

* **`FileNotFoundError: Model file not found`**
  - For custom models, ensure the `.pt` file is in `pythermal/pythermal/detections/yolo/models/`
  - Or provide the absolute path to the model file
  - Default models are automatically downloaded on first use (check internet connection)
  - See [YOLO Detection Guide](docs/YOLO_DETECTION.md#troubleshooting) for detailed troubleshooting
