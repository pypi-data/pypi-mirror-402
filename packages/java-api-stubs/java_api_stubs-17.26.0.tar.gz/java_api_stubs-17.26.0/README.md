This package contains a collection of [stubs] for [`java-api`]. These
files were generated using `mypy`'s [`stubgen`].

## Installation and usage

To use java-api-stubs, you may install it with `pip`. It requires Python
3.7 through 3.12.

```sh
python3 -m pip install \
    java-api-stubs \
    "mypy[python2]==0.971"

To run `mypy` against your code, execute the following command passing the
source directory (typically `src`) or a single file:

```sh
