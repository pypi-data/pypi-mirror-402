# Elements SDK

## Description

The Elements Platform is a collection of tools to analyze sensor data over space and time. The Elements SDK 
(software development kit) is a Python package that simplifies users' interaction with the Elements Platform API.

## Installation

[Readme: Installation](https://elements.readme.io/docs/installation-1)

## Usage

The Elements SDK is designed to simplify access to all the [elements-api](https://pypi.org/project/elements-api/) calls
that are available. Ensure that you have the correct elements-api package installed.

Each API uses a client object which requires the following env variables to be set:

```shell
ELEMENTS_HOST=https://terrascope-app.orbitalinsight.com/
ELEMENTS_TOKEN=<Elements API Token>
ELEMENTS_TIMEOUT=<Int timeout in seconds> defaults to 60 seconds
```

You will always want to ensure that you have the correct elements-sdk version installed. The latest can be found here:
https://pypi.org/project/elements-sdk/

To manually build a local version of the elements-sdk (for example, if you are making changes and want to test):
1. Update the version specified in the `pyproject.toml` file, e.g. `version = "1.0.6.1"` (must be `pep440`)
2. Execute from the top-level elements_sdk folder: `python3 -m build`. If you don't have the `build` package run `pip3 install build`
3. `cd dist/`
4. `pip3 install elements_sdk-1.0.6-test-py3-none-any.whl` (this file name may be different based on the version specified)


# CLI Usage #

## Installation ##

1. Pip install elements-sdk

```
$ pip install elements-sdk
````

If you're a developer working on the CLI itself, you may want to add [extras] in the installation.  This will include aditional packages which are used for building and testing the command line tool:

```
$ pip install 'elements-sdk[extras]'
```

2. Set some environment variables (here stashed in a 'source.sh' file).

```
$ cat source.sh
export ELEMENTS_HOST=api-papi.qa3.orbitalinsight.io
export ELEMENTS_AUTHOR=you@yourdomain.com
export ELEMENTS_ADMIN_TOKEN=<YOUR ADMIN TOKEN>
export ELEMENTS_TOKEN=<YOUR USER TOKEN>

$ source source.sh
```

# Basic usage #

The executible is installed as the `ts` command.  There is a old unix
'ts' command, but it's rarely used by most developers and hopefully
this choice does not create any serious problems with naming
conflicts.

The 'ts' command mirrors the overall structure of Elements itself.  The command tree is heirarchical, with groupings of commands.  The `--help` command shows the layout:

```
$ ts --help
Usage: ts [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Command Super-Groups:
  algorithm  'algorithm' super-group
  analysis   'analysis' super-group
  data       'data' super group

Command Groups:
  aoi            'aoi' command group
  credit         'credit' command group
  environment    'environment' command group
  imagery        'imagery' command group
  manifest       'manifest' command group
  permission     'permission' command group
  tasks          'tasks' command group
  toi            'toi' command group
  visualization  'visualization' command group
```

Any command can be used with a abbreviated for, as long as it's
unique.  So, `ts algo` is fine to avoid typing `ts algorithm`, but `ts
a` cannot be disambiguated from `ts analysis` or `ts aoi` commands.

Help is also available for each specific command, e.g. for the `algorithm` command:

```
$ ts algo --help
Usage: ts.py algo [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  'algorithm' super-group

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Command Groups:
  computation  Algorithm 'computation' command group
  config       Algorithm 'config' command group
  version      Algorithm 'version' command group

Commands:
  create    Create an algorithm object (no manifest)
  get       Get algorithm info
  register  Create an algorithm, and register it.
  update    Update an existing algorithm with manifest or pricing.
```

Each specific subcommand also has help, e.g. the `ts algo get` subcommand:

```
$ ts alg get --help
Usage: ts.py algo get [OPTIONS]

  Get algorithm info

Options:
  -ia, --algorithm_id TEXT
  -n, --algorithm_name TEXT
  -t, --truncate INTEGER     Truncate columns to this many characters.  Use 0
                             for no truncation.  (36 is the length of a full
                             UUID).
  -v, --verbose
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
```

## General Command Patterns ##

The commands generally try to use the same options for the same types
of inputs.  For example, IDs like algorithm_id or analysis_config_id,
will start with 'i' and then a character to denote type of ID
... e.g. `-ia <algorithm_id>`, or `-iv <algorithm_version_id>`.  For
things associated with algorithms, the second character will be lower
case, and for things associated with analysis, the second character
will be upper case.


Here are the main ones that *usually* follow the rules:
```
-i   - IDs

-ia  - algorithm_id
-iv  - algorithm_version_id
-ic  - algorithm_config_id
-ip  - algorithm_computation_id

-iA  - anlaysis_id
-iV  - analysis_version_id
-iC  - analysis_config_id
-iP  - analysis_computation_id

-n   - names

-na  - algorithm_name
-nc  - algorithm_config_name
-nA  - analysis_name
-nC  - analysis_config_name
```

### The Most Frequently Used Commands ###

The `ts` CLI allows you to perform pretty surgical operations in
Elements, and most of the commands do very specialized things which
you won't usually need.  For common tasks, there are `tasks` commands
to carry out things that would normally take many commands.  For
example, in order to register a new algorithm and create an analysis
to run it through the Elements UI, you normally use the following
commands (specific options are not shown here):

```
$ ts algo create
$ ts algo version create
$ ts algo config create
$ ts analysis create
$ ts analysis version create
$ ts analysis config create
```

All of these commands are bundled together in the `ts tasks init`
command.  If you require surgical control of algorithm registration,
you have it.  But generally, the `tasks` commands will probably suit
most needs.

#### Get algorithm info ####

```
$ ts alg get -na hlnorm
                 name                          algorithm_id                    author
0  hlnorm_foottraffic  deadbeef-5c5a-48d9-b65a-3748ebf9bb8e  wally@orbitalinsight.com
```

#### Look up Data Source and Data Type ####

This is useful when preparing a manifest to register an algorithm.
Data sources and types must be among those supported by elements.
To get a listing of the current set, do this:

```
$ ts data source list
```

```
$ ts data type list
```

#### Create a New Algorithm + Analysis ####

To put in a new algorithm and analysis, you have to create a manifest,
and then you can submit it with:

```
$ ts tasks init -m <manifest_yaml> -nC <analysis_config_name (appears in UI)>
```

That will create the algorithm, algorithm_version, algorithm_config, analysis, analysis_version, and analysis_config.


#### Update an Algorithm + Analysis ####

```
$ ts tasks update -m <manifest_yaml> -nC <analysis_config_name> -ia <algo_id> -iA <analysis_id> -V <new version>
```

#### Share an analysis with another user ####

```
$ ts perm set -iC <analysis_config_id> -u <username1> <username2> ...
```


### Finding IDs ###

Elements uses UUIDs to identify pretty much everything, and you
often need to get these in order to carry out certain operations.
Here are some of the most useful:


#### Dump IDs for an Analysis ####

This is a heirarchical dump of any analyses matching <search_string>,
and their analysis_versions, analysis_configs, and any computations
(there are options to filter the computations by date if there are too
many).

```
$ ts analysis display -nA <analysis_name_search_string>
```

#### Look up algorithm_id for an Analysis ####

Do find out info about an algorithm node in an analysis, query the
analysis version with `-C all` (get all available columns), and `-T`
(transpose ... so the output is readable).  The algorithm info is
buried in the printout.

```
ts ana version get -iV <analysis_version_id> -C all -T
```


### Testing an Algorithm ###

#### Checking for available imagery ####

In the examples:

- `-S <shapefile>` contains the AOI you wish to find imagery for
- `-ia <aoi_id>` refers to the id of an AOI in the provided shapefile (aois.geojson here).
- `-d` specifies the data source,
- `-p` specifies the 'processing spec' (not queryable through the API, you just have to know it).
- `-ts <start_time>`
- `-te <end_time>`
- `-s <search_service>` can be either 'SCENE' (already ingested images) or 'CATALOG' (available to order)

```
$ ts image search -S aois.geojson -ia <aoi_id> -ts 2023-01-08 -te 2023-01-31 -d planet_PSSceneSD -p PL-PSSceneSR -s CATALOG
```


#### Create and Run an algorithm computation ####

(-f 3 means 'daily')

```
$ ts comp create -iC <algo_config_id> -s 2022-01-01 -e 2022-01-07 -a ./myaois.geojson -f 3
```

The above example to create a computation will print out a computation_id.  Use it to run:

```
$ ts comp run -ip <comp_id>
```

#### Get info about the computation ####

```
$ ts comp get -ip <computation_id>

ecb494a3-e0e1-4c7b-804b-af45067816ba
id                   ecb494a3-e0e1-4c7b-804b-af45067816ba
aoi_collection_id    58111acf-50d8-4079-a562-6a98badd75da
algo_config_id       6b995056-dd72-494f-b7ce-abf27422d6f1
toi_id               aafe2b93-8f80-4cf8-994b-97ab43d346ec

```


#### Download computation results ####

```
$ ts algo comp download -ip <computation_id> -o test_result.zip
```
