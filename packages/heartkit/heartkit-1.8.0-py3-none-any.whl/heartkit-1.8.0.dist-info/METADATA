> An AI Development Kit for real-time heart-monitoring on ultra-low power SoCs

[![CI](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
[![Docs](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/docs.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/docs.yaml)
[![Release](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/actions/workflows/release.yaml)


heartKIT is an AI Development Kit (ADK) that enables developers to easily train and deploy real-time __heart-monitoring__ models onto [Ambiq's family of ultra-low power SoCs](https://ambiq.com/soc/). The kit provides a variety of datasets, efficient model architectures, and heart-related tasks. In addition, heartKIT provides optimization and deployment routines to generate efficient inference models. Finally, the kit includes a number of pre-trained models and task-level demos to showcase the capabilities.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time**: Inference is performed in real-time on battery-powered, edge devices.
* **Efficient**: Leverage Ambiq's ultra low-power SoCs for extreme energy efficiency.
* **Extensible**: Easily add new tasks, models, and datasets to the framework.
* **Open Source**: heartKIT is open source and available on GitHub.


## Requirements

* [Python ^3.12+](https://www.python.org)
* [uv ^1.6.1+](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

The following are also required to compile/flash the binary for the EVB demo:

* [Arm GNU Toolchain ^12.2](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
* [Segger J-Link ^7.92](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)

!!! note
    A [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is also available and defined in [./.devcontainer](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit/tree/main/.devcontainer).

## Installation

To get started, first install the local python package `heartkit` along with its dependencies via `PyPi`:

```bash
$ pip install heartkit
```

Alternatively, you can install the package from source by cloning the repository and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmbiqAI/heartkit.git
cd heartkit
uv sync
```

## Usage

__heartKIT__ can be used as either a CLI-based tool or as a Python package to perform advanced development. In both forms, heartKIT exposes a number of modes and tasks outlined below. In addition, by leveraging highly-customizable configurations, heartKIT can be used to create custom workflows for a given application with minimal coding. Refer to the [Quickstart](https://ambiqai.github.io/heartkit/quickstart/) to quickly get up and running in minutes.

---

## Tasks

__heartKIT__ includes a number of built-in **tasks**. Each task provides reference routines for training, evaluating, and exporting the model. The routines can be customized by providing a configuration file or by setting the parameters directly in the code. Additional tasks can be easily added to the __heartKIT__ framework by creating a new task class and registering it to the __task factory__.

- **Denoise**: Remove noise and artifacts from signals
- **Segmentation**: Perform ECG/PPG based segmentation
- **Rhythm**: Heart rhythm detection (AFIB, AFL)
- **Beat**: Classify individual beats (NORM, PAC, PVC)
- **BYOT**: Bring-Your-Own-Task (BYOT) to create custom tasks

---

## Modes

__heartKIT__ provides a number of **modes** that can be invoked for a given task. These modes can be accessed via the CLI or directly from the `task` within the Python package.

- **Download**: Download specified datasets
- **Train**: Train a model for specified task and datasets
- **Evaluate**: Evaluate a model for specified task and datasets
- **Export**: Export a trained model to TensorFlow Lite and TFLM
- **Demo**: Run task-level demo on PC or remotely on Ambiq EVB

---

## Datasets

__heartKIT__ exposes several open-source datasets for training each of the heartKIT tasks via a __dataset factory__. For certain tasks, we also provide synthetic data provided by [physioKIT](https://ambiqai.github.io/physiokit) to help improve model generalization. Each dataset has a corresponding Python class to aid in downloading and generating data for the given task. Additional datasets can be easily added to the heartKIT framework by creating a new dataset class and registering it to the dataset factory.

* **Icentia11k**: 11-lead ECG data collected from 11,000 subjects captured continously over two weeks.
* **LUDB**: 200 ten-second 12-lead ECG records w/ annotated P-wave, QRS, and T-wave boundaries.
* **QTDB**: 100+ fifteen-minute two-lead ECG recordings w/ annotated P-wave, QRS, and T-wave boundaries.
* **LSAD**: 10-second, 12-lead ECG dataset collected from 45,152 subjects w/ over 100 scp codes.
* **PTB-XL**: 10-second, 12-lead ECG dataset collected from 18,885 subjects w/ 72 different diagnostic classes.
* **Synthetic**: A synthetic dataset generator from [physioKIT](https://ambiqai.github.io/physiokit).
* **BYOD**: Bring-Your-Own-Dataset (BYOD) to add additional datasets.

## Models

__heartKIT__ provides a __model factory__ that allows you to easily create and train customized models. The model factory includes a number of modern networks well suited for efficient, real-time edge applications. Each model architecture exposes a number of high-level parameters that can be used to customize the network for a given application. These parameters can be set as part of the configuration accessible via the CLI and Python package.

## Model Zoo

A number of pre-trained models are available for each task. These models are trained on a variety of datasets and are optimized for deployment on Ambiq's ultra-low power SoCs. In addition to providing links to download the models, __heartKIT__ provides the corresponding configuration files and performance metrics. The configuration files allow you to easily retrain the models or use them as a starting point for a custom model. Furthermore, the performance metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For a number of the models, we provide experimental and ablation studies to showcase the impact of various design choices. Check out the [Model Zoo](https://ambiqai.github.io/heartkit/zoo) to learn more about the available models and their corresponding performance metrics.
