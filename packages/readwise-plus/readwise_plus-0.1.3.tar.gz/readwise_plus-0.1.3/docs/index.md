# readwise-plus

Comprehensive Python SDK for [Readwise](https://readwise.io) with high-level workflow abstractions.

[![CI](https://github.com/EvanOman/readwise-plus/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EvanOman/readwise-plus/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/readwise-plus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/readwise-plus/)
[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/readwise-plus)](https://pypi.org/project/readwise-plus/)

## Features

- **V2 API (Readwise)**: Full support for highlights, books, tags, and daily review
- **V3 API (Reader)**: Full support for documents, inbox, reading list, and archive
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for non-blocking I/O operations
- **Managers**: High-level abstractions for common operations
- **Workflows**: Pre-built workflows for digests, tagging, and syncing
- **Contrib**: Convenience interfaces for common integration patterns
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for quick operations

## Quick Example

```python
from readwise_sdk import ReadwiseClient

# Initialize with your API token
client = ReadwiseClient()  # Uses READWISE_API_KEY env var

# Get all highlights
for highlight in client.v2.list_highlights():
    print(highlight.text)

# Get Reader inbox
for doc in client.v3.list_documents(location="new"):
    print(doc.title)
```

### Async Example

```python
import asyncio
from readwise_sdk import AsyncReadwiseClient

async def main():
    async with AsyncReadwiseClient() as client:
        # Get highlights asynchronously
        async for highlight in client.v2.list_highlights():
            print(highlight.text)

        # Concurrent requests
        import asyncio
        tasks = [client.v3.get_document(doc_id) for doc_id in doc_ids]
        docs = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Architecture

The SDK is organized into layers of increasing abstraction:
