TexTOM is about having fun!
If your signal to noise ratio is low, rebin your data to lower spatial or angular resolution
The perfect TexTOM sample is a free floating pig on a balloon
If you see a shadow of your sample in the diffraction pattern, correct for absorption
Gold absorbs a lot of X-rays
Spatially resolved 3D texture analysis is a key to understanding biomineralisation processes
Not every beamtime makes you happy
If you're measuring biological samples, try to scan as fast as possible
The higher the symmetry of the crystal, the faster the TexTOM reconstruction will be
Even if we are looking at crystals, it can be worth collecting SAXS data for alignment
Do not forget to include your beamline scientist in your papers
Try to collect at least 2 independent peaks in your diffraction patterns
TexTOM was developed for biomineralized materials
A good night's sleep dramatically increases a synchrotron user's patience
The first TexTOM reconstruction was performed on a silica-witherite biomorph
2D experiments are much less painful than 3D experiments
If your sample crashes into the flight tube, consider tilting in the other direction
If we only could do TexTOM with a lab X-ray source..
Barely good enough counting statistics is the best counting statistics
Only a carefully planned TexTOM experiment is a good TexTOM experiment
Don't submit the same TexTOM proposal at 2 synchrotrons (you might actually get both)
Best is to talk to the beamline scientist before applying for TexTOM beamtime
If you do 3D-XRD, TexTOM or XRD-CT, is a question of peakiness
Consider combining 2D and 3D experiments to answer your research question
Glass or steel needles can be a good sample support
We deeply regret if the results do not align with your expectations
Fast-scanning along the vertical axis can improve your sample stability
Preparing small samples for TexTOM can be very expensive
Keep a detailled logbook during the TexTOM experiments
A good sketch of your experiment geometry will save you a lot of time
Always avoid having interesting peaks in the detector gaps
Try not to align 50 um-sized samples at 3 am
A semi-transparent beamstop is great in theory, but hard to actually make
Partial projections make the alignment very, very tedious or even impossible

A steel wire with a knot can be a good calibration sample
TexTOM with in-situ deformation is extra challenging
If your field of view is not large enough for your sample, just stitch 2 of them together
Sometimes, finding out a crystal structure is hard
Diamond particles sticking to your sample are not a contamination, but a fiducial for alignment
Background subtraction is a crucial step to a good reconstruction
A diffractlet is only as good as the cif file that generated it
Check your setup geometry, check again, and then multiply everything with -1
X-ray flux can only be compensated for with X-ray flux
