"""WebView Mixin classes for modular functionality.

This module provides Mixin classes that implement different aspects of
WebView functionality. These are combined by the main WebView class.

Mixins:
    WebViewWindowMixin: Window control methods (move, resize, minimize, etc.)
    WebViewContentMixin: Content loading methods (load_url, load_html, etc.)
    WebViewJSMixin: JavaScript interaction methods (eval_js, eval_js_async, etc.)
    WebViewEventMixin: Event system methods (emit, on, register_callback, etc.)
    WebViewApiMixin: API binding methods (bind_call, bind_api, etc.)
    WebViewDOMMixin: DOM manipulation methods (dom, dom_all, etc.)
