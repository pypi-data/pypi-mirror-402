This module contains the core WebView functionality:
- WebView: The main WebView class
- Backend: Backend abstraction layer
- Settings: WebView configuration
- Cookies: Cookie management

Example:
    >>> from auroraview.core import WebView, WebViewSettings
    >>> webview = WebView(title="My App")
    >>> webview.show()
