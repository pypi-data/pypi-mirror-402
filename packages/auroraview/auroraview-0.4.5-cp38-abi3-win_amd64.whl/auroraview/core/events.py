"""Window lifecycle events for AuroraView.

This module defines standard window events that can be listened to using
the WebView.on() decorator or register_callback() method.

Example:
    >>> from auroraview import WebView
    >>> from auroraview.core.events import WindowEvent
    >>>
    >>> webview = WebView.create("My App")
    >>>
    >>> @webview.on(WindowEvent.LOADED)
    >>> def on_loaded(data):
    ...     print("Page loaded!")
    >>>
    >>> @webview.on(WindowEvent.CLOSING)
    >>> def on_closing(data):
    ...     # Return False to prevent closing
    ...     return True
