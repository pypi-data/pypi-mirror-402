"""WebView pre-warming pool for Qt integration.

This module provides a pool mechanism to pre-warm WebView instances,
significantly reducing the perceived initialization time when users
open WebView-based tools.

The key insight is that WebView2 initialization is expensive (~300-500ms)
because it needs to:
1. Load the WebView2 Runtime
2. Create the CoreWebView2Environment
3. Initialize the browser process

By pre-warming a hidden WebView during DCC startup (when users expect
some loading time), subsequent WebView creations can reuse the warmed
environment and appear nearly instant.

Usage:
    # During DCC startup (e.g., in userSetup.py for Maya)
    from auroraview.integration.qt.pool import WebViewPool
    WebViewPool.prewarm()

    # Later, when creating a WebView
    from auroraview import QtWebView
    webview = QtWebView(parent=maya_main_window())  # Uses pre-warmed instance

class WebViewPool:
    """Pool for pre-warming WebView instances.

    This class manages a pool of pre-warmed WebView instances that can be
    reused to reduce initialization time. The pool is designed to be used
    as a singleton via class methods.

    The pre-warming strategy:
    1. Create a hidden WebView during DCC startup
    2. The WebView2 Runtime and Environment are initialized
    3. When a real WebView is needed, the environment is already warm
    4. The pre-warmed instance can be reused or discarded

    Note:
        WebView2's CoreWebView2Environment is process-bound, so pre-warming
        in the same process provides the most benefit. Cross-process sharing
        is not supported by WebView2.
