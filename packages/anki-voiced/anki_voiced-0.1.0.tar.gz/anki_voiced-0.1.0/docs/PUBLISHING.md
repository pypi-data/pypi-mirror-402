# Publishing Decks

This guide covers how to share your anki-voiced generated decks.

## Sharing .apkg Files

The generated `.apkg` files can be shared directly:

1. Email or cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
2. Personal website
3. GitHub releases
4. AnkiWeb (official Anki sharing platform)

## Publishing on AnkiWeb

AnkiWeb is the official platform for sharing Anki decks.

### Prerequisites

1. Create an AnkiWeb account at https://ankiweb.net
2. Sync your Anki desktop with AnkiWeb

### Steps

1. **Import the deck into Anki**
   - File → Import → Select your `.apkg` file

2. **Review and organize**
   - Check card formatting looks correct
   - Add tags if needed
   - Review audio plays correctly

3. **Sync to AnkiWeb**
   - Click the sync button or press Y
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Share the deck**
   - Go to https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks
   - Click "Share" on your deck
   - Fill in title, description, and tags

### Best Practices for AnkiWeb

- **Title**: Be descriptive (e.g., "Japanese IT Vocabulary - 500 Sentences with Audio")
- **Description**: Include:
  - What the deck covers
  - Number of cards/notes
  - Voice used
  - Sample content preview
- **Tags**: Add relevant tags (language, level, topic)
- **Screenshot**: Include a screenshot of the card design

### Example Description

```markdown
## Japanese IT Vocabulary - Professional Communication

500 sentences commonly used in Japanese IT workplaces, with native-quality AI audio.

### What's Included
- 500 notes (1000 cards with comprehension + production)

- Furigana readings for all kanji
- Professional IT terminology

### Topics

Generated with anki-voiced.

## File Size Considerations

Audio significantly increases deck size:

| Cards | Estimated Size |
|-------|----------------|
| 100 | ~5-10 MB |
| 500 | ~25-50 MB |
| 1000 | ~50-100 MB |

AnkiWeb has a 250 MB limit for shared decks. For larger decks:
- Consider splitting into multiple decks
- Use lower audio quality if needed

## Licensing

When publishing:
- **Your content**: You own the vocabulary and sentences
- **Audio**: Generated by AI (Kokoro TTS) - check Kokoro's license
- **Card design**: Open source, free to use

Consider adding a license to your deck description:
- CC BY 4.0 for open sharing
- CC BY-NC for non-commercial only
