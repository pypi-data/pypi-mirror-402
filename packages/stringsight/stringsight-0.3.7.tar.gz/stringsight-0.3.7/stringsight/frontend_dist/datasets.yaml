# StringSight Dataset Configuration
# Three loading strategies:
#   1. Paginated API (fastest): Leave cdn_url empty - uses /api/results/{dataset_name}/*
#   2. Folder path: Set cdn_url to folder path - fetches individual .jsonl files from folder
#   3. ZIP file (legacy): Set cdn_url ending in .zip - downloads and extracts ZIP

datasets:
  # All datasets now use fast paginated API endpoints
