To improve readability, provide a 2-5 word summary of the behavior in bold before the description. Format: **[Summary]**: [Description].

This should be a specific behavior of a model response, not a category of behaviors. Think: if a user saw this property, would they be able to understand the model behavior and gain valuable insight about the models specific behavior on a task?

For instance "Speaking Tone and Emoji Usage" is a category, but "uses an enthusiastic tone" is a specific behavior. Descriptions like "Provides detailed math responses" are not informative because they could apply to many clusters. Instead, describe the behavior in a way that is specific and informative to this cluster, even if it doesn't apply to all properties.

Avoid filler words like "detailed", "comprehensive" or "step-by-step" unless explicitly mentioned in the properties. Focus on the main behavior of the cluster. Also avoid generic behaviors like "the model hallucinated" or "the model generated incorrect information"; instead describe the specific behavior in more detail (e.g. "the model hallucinated a tool call to book a flight, resulting in a failed booking").

Consider whether a user could easily understand the model's behavior and come up with an example scenario described by this behavior. If given a model response, could a user determine whether the model is exhibiting this behavior?

Output the cluster behavior description and nothing else. You MUST provide a 2-5 word summary of the behavior in bold before the description. Format: **[Summary]**: [Description]. Ensure the description is 1-3 sentences with enough detail for a user to understand and identify the behavior within a repsonse. If the behavior is abstract or complex, you MUST provide a short, concrete example within the description to ensure it is clearly understood (e.g. "...such as repeating the same search query"). Avoid vague phrases like "fails to adapt" or "inefficiently" without specifying *how*. Avoid using multiple clauses or long strings of commas in the description (split into multiple sentences instead). I repeat, do NOT make confusing compoud sentences, you should not have more than 2 commas in the description."""

deduplication_clustering_systems_prompt = """You are a machine learning expert evaluating LLM output behaviors. Given a list of behaviors seen in LLM outputs across a dataset, merge those that are redundant or very similar, keeping the most informative and specific version. Think about if a user would gain any new information from seeing both behaviors.

Each behavior should be 1-2 clear and concise sentences. Avoid vague, broad, or meta-properties—focus on specific behaviors. Only use terms like "detailed", "comprehensive", or "step-by-step" if they are central to the behavior. Refrain from having high word overlap between your final properties, as this typically indicates that these are filler words (e.g. "clear", "comprehensive", "consistenly" etc). Avoid generic behaviors like "the model hallucinated" or "the model generated incorrect information"; instead describe the specific behavior in more detail (e.g. "the model hallucinated a tool call to book a flight, resulting in a failed booking"). Again, your final list should not have multiple properties that start with the same few words. You MUST provide a 2-5 word summary of the property in bold before the property. Format: **[Summary]**: [Description]. This is a strict requirement.
            
Make sure to include the minimal set of words that can be used to understand the property. Users at a glance should be able to understand the property and whether it's positive, negative, or neutral given the summary.

If two behaviors in the list are opposites (e.g., "uses X" and "doesn't use X"), keep both. Do not combine many behaviors into one summary or talk about the variation of behaviors, each behavior should be a single property that someone can easily identify if looking at a model response. Each behavior should be 1-3 sentences with enough detail for a user to understand and identify the behavior within a repsonse. If the behavior is abstract or complex, you MUST provide a short, concrete example within the description to ensure it is clearly understood (e.g. "...such as repeating the same search query").

I will provide you with a list of fine-grained behaviors of an LLM on a task. Your task is to cluster the behaviors into groups that are similar. Each group should be a single behavior that is representative of the group. Note that some behaviors may not belong to any group, which is fine, we are just trying to find the most interesting and informative behaviors that appear at least 5 times in the data.

Instructions:
1. Analyze all the fine-grained behaviors
2. Cluster the behaviors into at most {max_coarse_clusters}. Each group should be a single behavior that is representative of the group. Ensure that the behaviors in a cluster are not opposites of each other (e.g., "uses X" and "doesn't use X"), these should be in separate clusters. Do not combine many behaviors into one summary or talk about the variation of behaviors, each behavior should be a single property that someone can easily identify if looking at a model response.
3. Create clear, descriptive names for each cluster. Each cluster name should be 1-2 sentences decribing the behavior. You MUST provide a 2-5 word summary of the property in bold before the property.
