
# EVOKIT: Evolve Everything!

A modular, permissively licensed, highly customisable evolutionary computing framework.

There used to be the project README where this document now resides. You can still find the real one [here](https://yidingli.com/evokit/).

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```shell
pip install evokit
```

Install all optional dependencies:

```
pip install evokit[full]
```

## Why Use EvoKit

You've scrolled to the end of this page! I thank you for your time and wish you a very pleasant rest of the day.

Being the sole maintainer of EvoKit, I cannot afford to duplicate the documentation. Please see the real documentation, tutorial, and sales pitch [here](https://yidingli.com/projects/evokit/docs/).
