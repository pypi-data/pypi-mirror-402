## Development

### Setting up the Development Environment

```
git clone https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly-train.git
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install-dev
```

Make sure the environment is activated before running the following commands.

> [!WARNING]\
> Prepending commands with `uv run` might not work properly. Activate the environment
> directly instead.

### Running Checks and Tests

Before committing code, make sure all tests and checks pass:

```
make format
make static-checks
```

and if you want to run all the tests:

```
make test
```

### Documentation

Documentation is in the [docs](./docs) folder. To build the documentation, install dev
dependencies with `make install-dev`, then move to the `docs` folder and run:

```
make docs
```

This builds the documentation in the `docs/build/<version>` folder.

To build the documentation for the stable version, checkout the branch with the stable
version and run:

```
make docs-stable
```

This builds the documentaion in the `docs/build/stable` folder.

Docs can be served locally with:

```
make serve
```

#### Writing Documentation

The documentation source is in [docs/source](./docs/source). The documentation is
written in Markdown (MyST flavor). For more information regarding formatting, see:
