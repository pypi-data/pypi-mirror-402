# Object Detection with Ultralytics' YOLO

This tutorial demonstrates how to pretrain a YOLO model using LightlyTrain and then
fine-tune it for object detection using the `ultralytics` framework. To this end, we
will first pretrain on a [25k image subset](https://github.com/giddyyupp/coco-minitrain)
of the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) (only the images, no labels!), and
subsequently finetune on the labeled
[PASCAL VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

```{warning}
Using Ultralytics models might require a commercial Ultralytics license. See the
[Ultralytics website](https://www.ultralytics.com/license) for more information.
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

- `lightly-train` for pretraining, with support for `ultralytics`' YOLO models
- [`supervision`](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision) to visualize some of the
  annotated pictures

```bash
pip install "lightly-train[ultralytics]" "supervision==0.25.1"
```

## Pretraining on COCO-minitrain

Time for some magic! We'll first grab the COCO-minitrain dataset (25k images) directly
from HuggingFace...

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/bryanbocao/coco_minitrain/resolve/main/coco_minitrain_25k.zip
```

... unzip it...

```bash
unzip coco_minitrain_25k.zip
```

... and since Lightly**Train** does not require any labels, we can can confidently
delete all the labels:

```bash
rm -rf coco_minitrain_25k/labels
```

With the dataset ready, we can now start the pretraining. Pretraining with
Lightly**Train** could not be easier, you just pass the following parameters:

- `out`: you simply state where you want your logs and exported model to go to
- `model`: the model that you want to train, e.g. `yolo11s` from Ultralytics
- `data`: the path to a folder with images

Your data is simply assumed to be an arbitrarily nested folder; LightlyTrain with find
all images on its own and since there are no labels required there is no danger of ever
using false labels! 🕵️‍♂️

````{tab} Python
```python
# pretrain_yolo.py
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Pretrain with LightlyTrain.
    lightly_train.pretrain(
        out="out/coco_minitrain_pretrain",  # Output directory.
        model="ultralytics/yolo11s.yaml",   # Pass the YOLO model (use .yaml ending to start with random weights).
        data="coco_minitrain_25k/images",   # Path to a directory with training images.
        epochs=100,                         # Adjust epochs for shorter training.
        batch_size=128,                     # Adjust batch size based on hardware.
    )
```
````

````{tab} Command Line
```bash
lightly-train --out=out/coco_minitrain_pretrain --model=ultralytics/yolo11s.yaml --data=coco_minitrain_25k/images --epochs=100 --batch-size=128
```
````

And just like that you pretrained a YOLO11s backbone! 🥳 This backbone can't solve any
task yet, so in the next step we will finetune it on the PASCAL VOC dataset.

## Finetuning on PASCAL VOC

Now that the pretrained model has been exported, we will further fine-tune the model on
the task of object detection. The exported model already has exactly the format that
Ultralytics' YOLO expects, so after getting the dataset ready, we can get started with
only a few lines! ⚡️

In addition to fine-tuning the pretrained model we will also train a model that we
initialize with random weights. This will let us compare the performance between the
two, and show the great benefits of pretraining.

### Download the PASCAL VOC Dataset

We can download the dataset directly using Ultralytics' API with the `check_det_dataset`
function:

```python
from ultralytics.data.utils import check_det_dataset

dataset = check_det_dataset("VOC.yaml")
```

Ultralytics always downloads your datasets to a fixed location, which you can fetch via
their `settings` module:

```python
from ultralytics import settings

print(settings["datasets_dir"])
```

Inside that directory (<DATASET-DIR>), you will now have the following structure of
images and labels:

```bash
tree -d <DATASET-DIR>/VOC -I VOCdevkit

>    datasets/VOC
>    ├── images
>    │   ├── test2007
>    │   ├── train2007
>    │   ├── train2012
>    │   ├── val2007
>    │   └── val2012
>    └── labels
>        ├── test2007
>        ├── train2007
>        ├── train2012
>        ├── val2007
>        └── val2012
```

### Inspect a few Images

Let's use `supervision` and look at a few of the annotated samples to get a feeling of
what the data looks like:

```python
import random

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import supervision as sv
import yaml
from ultralytics import settings
from ultralytics.data.utils import check_det_dataset

dataset = check_det_dataset("VOC.yaml")

detections = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
    data_yaml_path=dataset["yaml_file"],
    images_directory_path=f"{settings['datasets_dir']}/VOC/images/train2012",
    annotations_directory_path=f"{settings['datasets_dir']}/VOC/labels/train2012",
)

with open(dataset["yaml_file"], "r") as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

names = data["names"]

box_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()
label_annotator = sv.LabelAnnotator()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 10))
ax = ax.flatten()

detections = [detections[random.randint(0, len(detections))] for _ in range(4)]

for i, (path, image, annotation) in enumerate(detections):
    annotated_image = box_annotator.annotate(scene=image, detections=annotation)
    annotated_image = label_annotator.annotate(
        scene=annotated_image,
        detections=annotation,
        labels=[names[elem] for elem in annotation.class_id],
    )
    ax[i].imshow(annotated_image[..., ::-1])
    ax[i].axis("off")

fig.tight_layout()
fig.show()
```

### Finetuning the Pretrained Model

All we have to do is to pass the path to the pretrained model to the `YOLO` class and
the rest is the same as always with Ultralytics.

````{tab} Python
```python
# finetune_yolo.py

from ultralytics import YOLO

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the exported model.
    model = YOLO("out/coco_minitrain_pretrain/exported_models/exported_last.pt")

    # Fine-tune with ultralytics.
    model.train(data="VOC.yaml", epochs=30, project="logs/voc_yolo11s", name="from_pretrained")
```
````

````{tab} Command Line
```bash
yolo detect train model="out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_last.pt" data="VOC.yaml" epochs=30 project="logs/voc_yolo11s" name="from_pretrained"
```
````

### Finetuning the Randomly Initialized Model

In order to quantify the influence of our pretraining, we also train a model from random
weights, in Ultralytics this follows the `.yaml` name convention.

````{tab} Python
```python
# finetune_scratch_yolo.py

from ultralytics import YOLO

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the exported model.
    model = YOLO("yolo11s.yaml") # randomly initialized model

    # Fine-tune with ultralytics.
    model.train(data="VOC.yaml", epochs=30, project="logs/voc_yolo11s", name="from_scratch")
```
````

````{tab} Command Line
```bash
yolo detect train model="yolo11s.yaml" data="VOC.yaml" epochs=30 project="logs/voc_yolo11s" name="from_scratch"
```
````

## Evaluating the Model Performance

Congratulations, you made it almost to the end! 🎉 The last thing we'll do is to analyze
the performance between the two. A very common metric to measure the performance of
object detectors is the `mAP50-95` which we plot in the next cell, for both the
pretrained model and the model that we trained from scratch.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

res_scratch = pd.read_csv("logs/voc_yolo11s/from_scratch/results.csv")
res_finetune = pd.read_csv("logs/voc_yolo11s/from_pretrained/results.csv")

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(res_scratch["epoch"], res_scratch["metrics/mAP50-95(B)"], label="scratch")
ax.plot(res_finetune["epoch"], res_finetune["metrics/mAP50-95(B)"], label="finetune")
ax.set_xlabel("Epoch")
ax.set_ylabel("mAP50-95")
max_pretrained = res_finetune["metrics/mAP50-95(B)"].max()
max_scratch = res_scratch["metrics/mAP50-95(B)"].max()
ax.set_title(
    f"Pretraining is {(max_pretrained - max_scratch) / max_scratch * 100:.2f}% better than scratch"
)
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

![Pretraining vs Scratch](results_VOC.png)

As clearly visible in the plot, the pretrained models converges much faster and achieves
a significantly higher mAP50-95 than the model trained from scratch!

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you've mastered the basics! 🎉 Ready to take it further? Here are some
exciting next steps:

- Go beyond distillation and explore other pretraining methods in LightlyTrain. Check
  [Methods](#methods) for more exciting possibilities!
- Try your hand at different YOLO flavors (`YOLOv5`, `YOLOv6`, `YOLOv8`).
- Take your pretrained model for a spin with {ref}`image embeddings <embed>` and
  similarity search.

Happy experimenting! 🚀
