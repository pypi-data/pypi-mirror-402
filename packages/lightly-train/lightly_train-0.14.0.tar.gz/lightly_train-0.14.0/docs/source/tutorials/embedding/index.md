# Embedding Model for Satellite Images with Torchvision's ResNet

[![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lightly-ai/lightly-train/blob/main/examples/notebooks/torchvision_embedding_model.ipynb)

This tutorial demonstrates how to train an embedding model with LightlyTrain on
unlabeled data. The model is then used to generate embeddings from the images and
visualize them in 2D. Embedding models are useful for a variety of tasks such as:

- Image retrieval
- Clustering
- Outlier detection
- Dataset curation

For this tutorial we will use the
[Aerial Image Dataset (AID)](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/) which contains 30,000
satellite images from Google Earth grouped into 30 classes.

## Install the Dependencies

To get started, we first need to install the required dependencies:

- `lightly-train` to train the embedding model and generate the embeddings
- `umap-learn` to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings for visualization

```bash
pip install lightly-train umap-learn
```

## Download the Dataset

Next, we have to download the [AID dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/):

```bash
wget https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/jiayuanchengala/aid-scene-classification-datasets
unzip aid-scene-classification-datasets
```

After unzipping, the dataset looks like this:

```bash
AID
├── Airport
│   ├── airport_100.jpg
│   ├── ...
│   └── airport_9.jpg
├── BareLand
│   ├── bareland_100.jpg
│   ├── ...
│   └── bareland_9.jpg
├── ...
└── Viaduct
    ├── viaduct_100.jpg
    ├── ...
    └── viaduct_9.jpg
```

The images are grouped by class into subdirectories. LightlyTrain doesn't need the class
information for training, but we will use it later to check the quality of the learned
embeddings.

## Train the Embedding Model

Once the data is downloaded, we can start training the embedding model. We will use a
lightweight ResNet18 model from torchvision for this. We also use bf16-mixed precision
to speed up training. If your GPU does not support mixed precision, you can remove the
`precision` argument.

Training for 1000 epochs on a single RTX 4090 GPU takes about 5 hours. If you don't want
to wait that long, you can reduce the number of epochs to 100. This will result in lower
embedding quality, but only takes 30 minutes to complete.

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.pretrain(
        out="out/aid_resnet18_lightly_train",
        data="AID",
        model="torchvision/resnet18",
        epochs=1000,
        precision="bf16-mixed",
    )
```

## Embed the Images

Once the model is trained, we can use it to generate embeddings for the images. We will
save the embeddings to a file called `embeddings_lightly_train.pt`.

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.embed(
        out="embeddings_lightly_train.pt",
        data="AID",
        checkpoint="out/aid_resnet18_lightly_train/checkpoints/last.ckpt",
    )
```

## Visualize the Embeddings

Now that we have the embeddings, we can visualize them in 2D with
[UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). UMAP is a dimension reduction
technique that is well suited for visualizing high-dimensional data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
import umap

# Load the embeddings
data = torch.load("embeddings_lightly_train.pt", weights_only=True, map_location="cpu")
embeddings = data["embeddings"]
filenames = data["filenames"]

# Reduce dimensions with UMAP
reducer = umap.UMAP()
embedding_2d = reducer.fit_transform(embeddings)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.scatter(embedding_2d[:, 0], embedding_2d[:, 1], s=5)
plt.title("UMAP of LightlyTrain Embeddings")
plt.show()
```

```{figure} /_static/images/tutorials/embedding/umap_lightly_train.jpg

```

We can see that the embeddings are nicely separated into well-defined clusters. Such
visualizations are extremely useful when curating a dataset. They can quickly give you
an overview of your data including outliers and duplicates. Furthermore, the clusters
can be used to efficiently label your dataset.

## Color the Clusters

Let's check if the clusters make sense by coloring them according to the class labels
that are available in this dataset. All filenames have the format
`<class>/<image_name>.jpg` which lets us extract the class labels easily. Let's plot the
embeddings again:

```python skip_ruff
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Color embeddings based on class labels
class_name_to_id = {class_name: i for i, class_name in enumerate({filename.split("/")[0] for filename in filenames})}
filename_to_class_id = {filename: class_name_to_id[filename.split("/")[0]] for filename in filenames}
color = [filename_to_class_id[filename] for filename in filenames]

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.scatter(embedding_2d[:, 0], embedding_2d[:, 1], s=5, c=color, cmap="tab20")
plt.title("UMAP of LightlyTrain Embeddings Colored by Class")
plt.show()
```

```{figure} /_static/images/tutorials/embedding/umap_lightly_train_colored.jpg

```

The embeddings are well separated by class with few outliers. The LightlyTrain model has
learned meaningful embeddings **without** using any class information! For reference, we
show a comparison to embeddings generated with an ImageNet supervised pretrained model
below:

```{figure} /_static/images/tutorials/embedding/umap_lightly_train_imagenet_colored.jpg

The above image was generated with the following code:

```python skip_ruff

import lightly_train
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
import umap

lightly_train.pretrain(
    out="out/aid_resnet18_imagenet",
    data="AID",
    model="torchvision/resnet18",
    model_args={"weights": "IMAGENET1K_V1"},
    epochs=0,
)


lightly_train.embed(
    out="embeddings_imagenet.pt",
    data="AID",
    checkpoint="out/aid_resnet18_imagenet/checkpoints/last.ckpt",
)


# Load the embeddings
data_imagenet = torch.load("embeddings_imagenet.pt", weights_only=True, map_location="cpu")
embeddings_imagenet = data_imagenet["embeddings"]
filenames_imagenet = data_imagenet["filenames"]

# Reduce dimensions with UMAP
reducer_imagenet = umap.UMAP()
embedding_2d_imagenet = reducer.fit_transform(embeddings_imagenet)

# Color
color_imagenet = [filename_to_class_id[filename] for filename in filenames_imagenet]

# Plot
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(16, 8))
axs[0].scatter(embedding_2d[:, 0], embedding_2d[:, 1], s=5, c=color, cmap="tab20")
axs[1].scatter(embedding_2d_imagenet[:, 0], embedding_2d_imagenet[:, 1], s=5, c=color_imagenet, cmap="tab20")
axs[0].set_title("UMAP of LightlyTrain Embeddings")
axs[1].set_title("UMAP of ImageNet Supervised Embeddings")
axs[0].axis("off")
axs[1].axis("off")
plt.savefig("umap_lightly_train_imagenet_colored.jpg", bbox_inches="tight")
plt.show()
```
-->

We can see that the clusters from the LightlyTrain embeddings are much more compact and
have fewer overlaps. This means that the model has learned better representations and
will make fewer mistakes for embedding-based tasks like image retrieval or clustering.
This highlights how training an embedding model on the target dataset can improve the
embeddings quality compared to using an off-the-shelf embedding model.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have learned how to train an embedding model using unlabeled data
with LightlyTrain. We have also seen how to visualize the embeddings with UMAP and color
them according to class labels. The visualizations show that the model has learned
strong embeddings that capture the information of the images well and group similar
images together. This is a great starting point for fine-tuning or any embedding-based
task such as image retrieval, clustering, outlier detection or dataset curation.
