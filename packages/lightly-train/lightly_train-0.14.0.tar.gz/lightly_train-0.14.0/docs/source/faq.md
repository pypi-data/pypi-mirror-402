```{dropdown} <h6>What is LightlyTrain?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-lightlytrain" href="#what-is-lightlytrain" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain is a production-ready framework to pretrain computer vision models on unlabeled
data. This allows you to get started with model training immediately as you don't have
to wait for your data to get labeled and it significantly reduces the amount of labeled
data needed to reach a high model performance. This decreases model deployment time and
costs, and allows you to use your unlabeled data to its full potential.

Training a model with LightlyTrain only requires a single line of code. It is available
as a Python package or Docker container and runs fully on-premise.

```{dropdown} <h6>What's the difference between LightlyTrain and LightlySSL?<a class="headerlink" id="whats-the-difference-between-lightlytrain-and-lightlyssl" href="#whats-the-difference-between-lightlytrain-and-lightlyssl" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
- **LightlyTrain**: A production-ready framework designed for engineers and teams who want to
  pretrain models with minimal code and configuration. It integrates directly with many popular
  model training libraries.
- **LightlySSL**: A research-oriented package targeting self-supervised learning (SSL) researchers
  who want to modify and develop new SSL methods. It is not designed for production use and requires
  expertise in writing model training code.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What's the difference between LightlyTrain and other open-source self-supervised learning implementations?<a class="headerlink" id="whats-the-difference-between-lightlytrain-and-other-open-source-self-supervised-learning-implementations" href="#whats-the-difference-between-lightlytrain-and-other-open-source-self-supervised-learning-implementations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain offers several advantages over other self-supervised learning (SSL) implementations:

- **User-friendly**: You don't need to be an SSL expert - focus on training your model instead 
  of implementation details. Existing SSL frameworks require deep model training knowledge and
  focus on research instead of industry applications.
- **Works with various model architectures**: Popular SSL frameworks are usually limited to few
  model architectures like ResNet or ViT. LightlyTrain directly integrates with different
  libraries such as Torchvision, Ultralytics, etc. and allows pretraining of their models out
  of the box.
- **Handles complexity**: LightlyTrain manages many complexities around model training and SSL, 
  such as scaling from single GPU to multi-GPU training and optimizing hyperparameters.
- **Seamless workflow**: LightlyTrain automatically pretrains the correct layers and exports 
  models in the right format for fine-tuning, reducing risks when moving from pretraining to 
  fine-tuning.
- **DINOv2 distillation**: Lightly has developed a unique distillation method that allows
  you to pretrain smaller models with the knowledge of larger DINOv2 models without the need for
  large compute resources.
- **DINOv2 pretraining**: LightlyTrain supports DINOv2 pretraining out of the box,
  allowing you to train state-of-the-art vision foundation models on your own datasets.

are optimized to learn strong image representations for tasks such as image visualization,
clustering, and retrieval. With LightlyTrain you can train your own image embedding model
on your unlabeled data. LightlyTrain also comes with an embedding function that lets you
create image embeddings of your data.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Which data types does LightlyTrain support?<a class="headerlink" id="which-data-types-does-lightlytrain-support" href="#which-data-types-does-lightlytrain-support" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain currently supports training on images and video frames. It works with standard image
formats such as JPG, PNG, etc. The framework handles image loading, preprocessing, and transformation
automatically.

See [the documentation](pretrain-data) for all the supported data formats.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Which datasets and domains does LightlyTrain support?<a class="headerlink" id="which-datasets-and-domains-does-lightlytrain-support" href="#which-datasets-and-domains-does-lightlytrain-support" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain is designed to work with any RGB image or video dataset and domain. It works especially
well for domains such as:

- Video Analytics
- Robotics
- ADAS
- Agriculture
- Medical Imaging
- Visual Inspection

As LightlyTrain doesn't need labeled data it is particularly valuable in domains
where labeled data is rare or expensive to get.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>How much data do I need?<a class="headerlink" id="how-much-data-do-i-need" href="#how-much-data-do-i-need" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain supports use cases from thousands to millions of images. We recommend
a minimum of a several thousand unlabeled images for training with LightlyTrain and 100+ labeled images
for the fine-tuning afterwards. The larger the difference in dataset size between the
unlabeled and labeled data, the larger the benefit of LightlyTrain. For best
results we recommend at least 5x more unlabeled than labeled data. However, for most cases
2x more unlabeled than labeled data yields already strong improvements.

An example use case looks like this:
- 100'000 unlabeled images
- 10'000 labeled training images
- 1'000 labeled validation images

The model is pretrained on the 100'000 unlabeled images with LightlyTrain.
The pretrained model is then fine-tuned on the 10'000 labeled images with your favorite
fine-tuning library and evaluated on the 1'000 validation images.

You can include the 10'000 labeled images in the unlabeled images for
pretraining (it will make your model better). But do not include the validation
images in the unlabeled data as this will lead to data leakage.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Can I train on labeled images?<a class="headerlink" id="can-i-train-on-labeled-images" href="#can-i-train-on-labeled-images" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Yes but LightlyTrain will ignore the labels. In fact, we recommend to add the
training split of your labeled dataset to the dataset used for pretraining with
LightlyTrain. This will make your model better. However, do not include the
validation images in dataset used for pretraining with LightlyTrain as this
leads to data leakage when you later evaluate the model on those images.
The unlabeled dataset must always be treated like a training split and any images
in the unlabeled set must not be used for evaluation.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Is there a limit on the number of images I can use?<a class="headerlink" id="is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-images-i-can-use" href="#is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-images-i-can-use" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
No, LightlyTrain does not impose any limits on the number of images you can use for training.
The framework is designed to scale to millions of images and you can use as many images as
your hardware can handle. In fact, the training method in LightlyTrain performs better the
more images you use as long as they are similar to the images you want to use the model on.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Can I pretrain a custom model on my own dataset?<a class="headerlink" id="can-i-pretrain-a-custom-model-on-my-own-dataset" href="#can-i-pretrain-a-custom-model-on-my-own-dataset" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Yes you can! LightlyTrain supports any model implemented in PyTorch. See the documentation
on [custom models](#custom-models) on how to pretrain your model.

There are no restrictions on the dataset you use, except that it must contain images stored in a directory.
See [the documentation](pretrain-data) for all the supported images formats and the dataset structure.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>How can I fine-tune a model?<a class="headerlink" id="how-can-i-fine-tune-a-model" href="#how-can-i-fine-tune-a-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
The focus of LightlyTrain is on pretraining models on unlabeled data. It doesn't support
fine-tuning. Instead, LightlyTrain integrates with popular fine-tuning libraries and
supports pretraining models from those libraries out of the box. At the end of the
pretraining, LightlyTrain exports the model in the correct format for the fine-tuning
library which allows you to directly fine-tune the model without having to worry about
converting and copying model weights.

See the documentation for a list of all [supported libraries](#models-supported-libraries).
```

```{dropdown} <h6>How can I improve the performance of my model?<a class="headerlink" id="how-can-i-improve-the-performance-of-my-model" href="#how-can-i-improve-the-performance-of-my-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
If your model performance is not satisfactory after fine-tuning consider the following
options:

- Check that the fine-tuning runs smoothly. Make sure there are no large spikes in the
  fine-tuning loss curves as those can negate the effect of the LightlyTrain pretraining.
  Pretrained models might need a lower fine-tuning learning rate than randomly initialized models.
- Check that the pretraining runs smoothly. Make sure there are no large spikes in the
  pretraining loss curves. If you observe unstable training then lower the learning rate.
- Increase the number of epochs for pretraining with LightlyTrain. Pretraining benefits
  a lot from long training schedules and doesn't suffer as much from overfitting as
  fine-tuning. Large datasets (>100'000 images) benefit from pretraining up to 3000 epochs.
  Smaller datasets (<100'000 images) benefit from even longer pretraining for up to 10'000 epochs.
- Increase the number of unlabeled images in your pretraining dataset. The more unlabeled
  images you have the better. If you have more labeled than unlabeled data then pretraining
  is unlikely to help.
- If pretraining and fine-tuning are stable and you don't observe improvements then
  increase the learning rate during pretraining. This is especially recommended for smaller models
  with ~10Mio or fewer parameters.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Do I have to tune hyperparameters?<a class="headerlink" id="do-i-have-to-tune-hyperparameters" href="#do-i-have-to-tune-hyperparameters" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
No, LightlyTrain is designed to work well with the default hyperparameters for most use cases. 
If you want to customize specific aspects of the training, LightlyTrain provides configuration 
options through its API. However, most users can achieve good results without any manual 
hyperparameter tuning.

You might want to adjust the following parameters based on your hardware and training budget:
- `batch_size`: We recommend a batch size between 128-1536.
- `epochs`: We recommend to pretrain for 100-3000 epochs for large datasets (>100'000 images).
  For small datasets (<100'000 images) we recommend to pretrain up to 10'000 epochs.
- `num_devices`: The number of GPUs to use for training. LightlyTrain automatically uses all available
  GPUs.
- `precision`: We recommend training with "bf16-mixed" precision for faster training speed.

Other parameters should only be adjusted for special use cases:
- `learning_rate`: Change only if you want to further optimize model performance. Increase learning
  rate for small models.
- `transform_args`: Change only if you need to customize the data augmentation pipeline in case
  you have a special dataset.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Why should I use LightlyTrain instead of other already pretrained models?<a class="headerlink" id="why-should-i-use-lightlytrain-instead-of-other-already-pretrained-models" href="#why-should-i-use-lightlytrain-instead-of-other-already-pretrained-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Pretrained models are often trained on curated, object-centric datasets that don't reflect the reality of
real-world applications. In practice, these models can struggle when faced with raw, unlabeled data from
production environments. Fortunately, LightlyTrain offers a scalable way to learn tailored representations
directly from your own unlabeled data. Off-the-shelf models can still be a good starting point, and LightlyTrain
fully supports leveraging existing pretrained weights. The benefit is that you can adapt representations
to your domain without requiring any labels. Whether you start from scratch or fine-tune existing weights
is entirely up to you.

LightlyTrain is most beneficial in these scenarios:

- **Different data domains**: When working with data that has a very different distribution from
  the data existing pretrained models are trained on. For example, models pretrained on COCO or
  ImageNet often don't transfer well to medical images or industrial data. In these cases,
  LightlyTrain can help you pretrain a model that is better suited for your specific domain.
- **Policies or license restrictions**: Models trained on popular datasets such as ImageNet have
  oftentimes unclear licensing policies, making it difficult to use them in production. If you are
  restricted by policies or licenses, LightlyTrain allows you to pretrain your own model without
  relying on existing pretrained models.
- **Limited labeled data**: When you have access to a lot of unlabeled data but limited labeled 
  data for your specific task.
- **Custom architectures**: When using custom model architectures where no pretrained checkpoints 
  are available.

For domains similar to COCO or natural images, supervised pretrained models like YOLO or Vision Transformers
are very strong, and you may not see significant benefits from SSL pretraining.
```

## Technical Background

```{dropdown} <h6>What is pretraining?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-pretraining" href="#what-is-pretraining" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
In the context of LightlyTrain, pretraining is the process of training a model on an unlabeled dataset to
learn semantic representations of the images in the dataset. A pretrained model cannot classify or detect
objects yet. But it has already a very good internal representation of the dataset and requires only a few
labeled example images to become a strong model for a specific task.

Pretrained model serves as a much better starting point for fine-tuning than 
randomly initialized weights, typically leading to:
- Higher accuracy
- Faster convergence
- Better generalization
- Less labeled data needed for downstream tasks
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What is fine-tuning?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-fine-tuning" href="#what-is-fine-tuning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pretrained model and further training it on a specific 
task with labeled data. The pretrained model already has learned useful visual features, and 
fine-tuning adapts these features to a specific task such as classification, object detection, 
or segmentation.

With LightlyTrain, you first pretrain your model on unlabeled data, then fine-tune it on a smaller
labeled dataset for your specific task.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What is the difference between pretraining and fine-tuning?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-the-difference-between-pretraining-and-fine-tuning" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-pretraining-and-fine-tuning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Pretraining and fine-tuning are two distinct phases in the model training process:

**Pretraining:**
- Uses unlabeled data
- Usually performed on larger datasets
- Uses self-supervised learning
- Resulting model is general-purpose

**Fine-tuning:**
- Uses labeled data for a specific task
- Can be performed on smaller datasets
- Uses supervised learning
- Resulting model is task specific (classification, object detection, etc.)


Pretraining happens before fine-tuning and is essential for learning useful
representations from unlabeled data. LightlyTrain focuses on the pretraining phase,
while fine-tuning is typically done using standard supervised learning frameworks
appropriate for your downstream task.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Which pretraining methods are supported?<a class="headerlink" id="which-pretraining-methods-are-supported" href="#which-pretraining-methods-are-supported" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
LightlyTrain supports different methods such as:
- DINOv2 distillation
- DINOv2
- DINO
- SimCLR

See [the documentation on methods](#methods) for more information.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>Will you add more pretraining methods?<a class="headerlink" id="will-you-add-more-pretraining-methods" href="#will-you-add-more-pretraining-methods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Yes, we will add more pretraining methods in the future. That being said, there are hundreds of
different pretraining methods and we will not add all of them. Instead, the goal of LightlyTrain
is to focus on the best pretraining methods for industry relevant tasks.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What is self-supervised learning (SSL)?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-self-supervised-learning-ssl" href="#what-is-self-supervised-learning-ssl" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning approach where models learn useful 
representations from unlabeled data without requiring manual annotations. Instead of being 
trained on explicit labels, SSL methods create "proxy tasks" where the model learns by solving 
objectives derived from the data itself.

In computer vision, SSL typically involves training models to match different views of the same 
image, predict masked regions, or understand relationships between different parts of images. 
This allows models to develop rich, general-purpose representations that can be fine-tuned for 
downstream tasks with much less labeled data.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What is distillation?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-distillation" href="#what-is-distillation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
In the context of LightlyTrain, distillation refers to knowledge distillation where a teacher 
model guides the training of your student model.

During distillation, the student model learns to produce similar feature representations as the 
teacher model for the same input images. This allows smaller models to benefit from the knowledge 
of larger, more powerful models like vision transformers pretrained with DINOv2, without requiring
the same computational resources for training.
```

```{dropdown} <h6>What is DINOv2?<a class="headerlink" id="what-is-dinov2" href="#what-is-dinov2" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h6>
DINOv2 is a self-supervised learning method developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) that produces 
state-of-the-art visual representations. It builds upon the original DINO (Self-Distillation with 
No Labels) method and uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.

DINOv2 models are pretrained on a diverse set of image data and have shown remarkable performance 
across various visual tasks, from classification to dense prediction tasks. The resulting 
representations exhibit strong semantic understanding and work well for zero-shot and few-shot 
learning scenarios.

In LightlyTrain, DINOv2-pretrained ViT models serve as teacher models for the distillation method, 
transferring their knowledge to your chosen backbone architecture.
```
