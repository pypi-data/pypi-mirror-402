# Hardware Recommendations

We tested Lightly**Train** in various setups, the following training examples with
hardware setups are provided as a performance reference:

- **Distillation YOLOv8l on 2 × NVIDIA RTX 4090**

  - `method='distillation'`
  - `batch_size=512`
  - `model='ultralytics/yolov8l.yaml'`
  - `precision='bf16-mixed'`
  - Dataset Size: 1 million images
  - GPUs: 2 × NVIDIA RTX 4090
  - GPU Memory: ~16GB per GPU
  - Time per Epoch: ~19 minutes

- **Distillation YOLO11x on 4 × NVIDIA H100**

  - `method='distillation'`
  - `batch_size=2048`
  - `model='ultralytics/yolov11x.yaml'`
  - `precision='32-true'`
  - Dataset Size: 1 million images
  - GPUs: 4 × NVIDIA H100
  - GPU Memory: ~80GB per GPU
  - Time per Epoch: ~6 minutes

Those setups deliver efficient training while handling large-scale datasets with high
throughput. While smaller setups can be used, training times may increase significantly
and batch size might need to be reduced to fit GPU memory.
