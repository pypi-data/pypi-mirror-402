# DINO

[DINO (Distillation with No Labels)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294) is a
self-supervised learning framework for visual representation learning using knowledge
distillation but without the need for labels. Similar to knowledge distillation, DINO
uses a teacher-student setup where the student learns to mimic the teacher's outputs.
The major difference is that DINO uses an exponential moving average of the student as
teacher. DINO achieves strong performance on image clustering, segmentation, and
zero-shot transfer tasks.

## Use DINO in LightlyTrain

````{tab} Python
```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.pretrain(
        out="out/my_experiment", 
        data="my_data_dir",
        model="torchvision/resnet18",
        method="dino",
    )
````

````{tab} Command Line
```bash
lightly-train pretrain out=out/my_experiment data=my_data_dir model="torchvision/resnet18" method="dino"
````

## What's under the Hood

DINO trains a student network to match the output of a momentum-averaged teacher network
without labels. It employs a self-distillation objective with a cross-entropy loss
between the student and teacher outputs. DINO uses random cropping, resizing, color
jittering, and Gaussian blur to create diverse views of the same image. In particular,
DINO employs a multi-crop augmentation strategy to generate two global views and
multiple local views that are smaller crops of the original image. Additionally,
centering and sharpening of the teacher pseudo labels is used to stabilize the training.

## Lightly Recommendations

- **Models**: DINO works well with both ViT and CNN.
- **Batch Size**: We recommend somewhere between 256 and 1024 for DINO as the original
  paper suggested.
- **Number of Epochs**: We recommend somewhere between 100 to 300 epochs. However, DINO
  benefits from longer schedules and may still improve after training for more than 300
  epochs.
