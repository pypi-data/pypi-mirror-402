This module allows to generate and render some pie charts for your Odoo projects.

It consists of two pie charts on the project form view:

- number of installed modules
- number of lines of code

 Both measures are split based on some criteria (configurable), by default:
 - Odoo CE
 - Odoo Enterprise
 - OCA
 - Community (not OCA)
 - Specific code
 - Misc. (everything not part of other criteria above)

 Each criteria having a rendering color used on the charts.
