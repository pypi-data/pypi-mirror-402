"""
Event log interface for appending and querying events.

Typical implementations include:
- InMemoryEventLog: Transient, in-memory event log for testing or ephemeral use cases
- FSPersistenceEventLog: File system-based event log for durable storage
- DatabaseEventLog: (future) Database-backed event log for scalable storage and querying

It is used in various parts of the system for logging events with metadata.
- memory persistent implementation for saving events durably
- graph state store for appending state change events
