        Retrieve recent event data.

        This method fetches the data or text of recent events, optionally filtered by kinds and tags.
        Unlike `recent()`, which returns full Event objects, this method extracts and returns only the
        data or text content of the events. This is useful for scenarios where only the event payloads are needed.

        Args:

            list[Any]: A list of event data or text.

        Notes:
            This method first retrieves recent events using the `recent()` method and then filters them
            based on the provided tags. It extracts the `data` attribute if available; otherwise, it
            attempts to parse the `text` attribute as JSON. If parsing fails, the raw text is returned.

            Memory out of the limit will be discarded in the HotLog layer (but persistent in the Persistence layer).
