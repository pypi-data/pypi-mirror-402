"""
Artifact index interface for storing and retrieving artifact metadata.
This is a special index used for tracking artifacts generated during runs.

Typical implementations include:
- FileSystemArtifactIndex: File system-based artifact index for durable storage
- DatabaseArtifactIndex: (future) Database-backed artifact index for scalable storage and querying

Note Artifact index is a specialized index for artifacts, different from general document or blob stores.
