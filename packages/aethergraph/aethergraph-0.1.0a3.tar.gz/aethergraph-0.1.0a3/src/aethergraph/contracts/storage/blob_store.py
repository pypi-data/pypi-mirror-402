"""
Blob store interface for storing and retrieving binary large objects (blobs).
Typical implementations include:
- FSBlobStore: File system-based blob store for persistent storage
- S3BlobStore: Amazon S3-based blob store for cloud storage

This is usually used for storing large binary data such as images, audio, or other media files.
For example:
- Artifact Store for saving generated images or files
