        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
        1. Definitions.
        
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
        
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
        
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
        
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# AetherGraph

**AetherGraph** is a **Python-first agentic DAG execution framework** for building and orchestrating AI-powered workflows. It pairs a clean, function-oriented developer experience with a resilient runtime—event-driven waits, resumable runs, and pluggable services (LLM, memory, artifacts, RAG)—so you can start simple and scale to complex R&D pipelines.

Use AetherGraph to prototype interactive assistants, simulation/optimization loops, data transforms, or multi-step automations without boilerplate. It works **with or without LLMs**—bring your own tools and services, and compose them into repeatable, observable graphs.

* **[Introduction](https://aiperture.io)**
* **[Docs](https://aiperture.github.io/aethergraph-docs/)**
* **[Examples](https://github.com/AIperture/aethergraph-examples)**

---

## Requirements

* Python **3.10+**
* macOS, Linux, or Windows
* *(Suggested)* LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
* *(Optional)* `slack` or `telegram` token. See [Channel Setup](https://aiperture.github.io/aethergraph-docs/channel-setup/introduction/)
* *(Optional UI)* A modern browser to use the built-in AetherGraph web UI

---

## Install

### Option A — PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install aethergraph
```

Optional extras:

```bash
# Slack adapter
pip install "aethergraph[slack]"

# Dev tooling (linting, tests, types)
pip install "aethergraph[dev]"
```

> The PyPI package ships with a prebuilt UI bundle, so `/ui` works out of the box
> when you run the server locally.

### Option B — From source (editable dev mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIperture/aethergraph.git
cd aethergraph

# Base
pip install -e .

# With extras
echo "(optional)" && pip install -e ".[slack,dev]"
```

> When running from source, the backend still works without the frontend bundle.
> If you want the **built-in UI** from source, you’ll need to build the frontend
> and copy the static bundle into `aethergraph/server/ui_static/`
> (see the “UI Guide” in the docs).

---

## Configure

Aethergraph can run without an LLM, but for many LLM-backed flows in [examples](https://github.com/AIperture/aethergraph-examples), set keys via environment variables or a local secrets file.

Minimal example (OpenAI):

```ini
# .env (example)
AETHERGRAPH_LLM__ENABLED=true
AETHERGRAPH_LLM__DEFAULT__PROVIDER=openai
AETHERGRAPH_LLM__DEFAULT__MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
AETHERGRAPH_LLM__DEFAULT__API_KEY=sk-...your-key...
```

Or inline in a script at runtime (for on-demand key setting):

```python
from aethergraph.runtime import register_llm_client

open_ai_client = register_llm_client(
    profile="my_llm",
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key="sk-...your-key...",
)
```

See the docs for setup of **external channel** methods (Slack, Telegram, etc.) for real-time interaction.

> **Where should `.env` live?**
> In your **project root** (the directory where you run your Python entry point).
> You can override with `AETHERGRAPH_ENV_FILE=/path/to/.env` if needed.

---

## Verify install

```bash
python -c "import aethergraph; print('AetherGraph OK, version:', getattr(aethergraph, '__version__', 'dev'))"
```

---

## Run the built-in UI

AetherGraph ships with a small web UI that lets you:

* Browse and launch **apps** (click-to-run graphs)
* Chat with **agents** (graph-backed chat endpoints)
* Inspect **runs**, **sessions**, and **artifacts**

### 1. Define a simple project module

From your project root:

```text
my_project/
  demos/
    __init__.py
    chat_demo.py
  aethergraph_data/   # workspace (created automatically as needed)
```

Example `chat_demo.py`:

```python
# demos/chat_demo.py
from aethergraph import graphify

@graphify(
    name="chat_with_memory_demo",
    inputs=[],
    outputs=["turns", "summary"],
    as_app={
        "id": "chat_with_memory_demo",
        "name": "Chat with Memory",
    },
)
def chat_with_memory_demo():
    # Your graph implementation here – tools, nodes, etc.
    ...
```

> `as_app={...}` tells AetherGraph to expose this graph in the **App Gallery** of the UI.
> You can also define `graph_fn`-based **agents** with `as_agent={...}` to appear in the
> **Agent Gallery**.

### 2. Start the server with UI from the terminal (recommended)

From `my_project/`:

```bash
aethergraph serve \
  --project-root . \
  --load-module demos \
  --reload
```

This will:

* Add `.` to `sys.path` so `demos` can be imported.
* Load any graphs/apps/agents defined in the `demos` module.
* Start the API + UI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8745`.
* Enable **auto-reload**: editing your graph files triggers a restart and reload.

You should see log lines like:

```text
[AetherGraph] 🚀  Server started at:  http://127.0.0.1:8745
[AetherGraph] 🖥️  UI:                 http://127.0.0.1:8745/ui
[AetherGraph] 📡  API:                http://127.0.0.1:8745/api/v1/
[AetherGraph] 📂  Workspace:          ./aethergraph_data
[AetherGraph] ♻️  Auto-reload:        enabled
```

Then open in your browser:

* **UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8745/ui` – App Gallery, Agent Gallery, runs, sessions, artifacts.
* **API:** `http://127.0.0.1:8745/api/v1/` – for direct HTTP calls.

### 3. (Optional) Start the server from a Python script

If you prefer to embed the server in your own launcher:

```python
# start_server.py
from aethergraph import start_server

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server(
        workspace="./aethergraph_data",
        project_root=".",
        load_module=["demos"],
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=8745,
    )
```

```bash
python start_server.py
```

> For **active development**, the CLI with `--reload` is recommended.
> `start_server(...)` is better when you want a simple “ship a server in my app” story.

For more details, see the **UI Guide** section in the docs (server setup, agents/apps, and common pitfalls).

## Examples

Quick-start scripts live under `examples/` in this repo.

Run an example:

```bash
cd examples
python hello_world.py
```

A growing gallery of standalone examples and recipes lives under:

* **Repo:** [https://github.com/AIperture/aethergraph-examples](https://github.com/AIperture/aethergraph-examples)

---

## Troubleshooting

* **`ModuleNotFoundError`**: ensure you installed into the active venv and that your shell is using it.
* **LLM/API errors**: confirm provider/model/key configuration (env vars or your local secrets file).
* **Windows path quirks**: clear any local cache folders (e.g., `.rag/`) and re-run; verify write permissions.
* **Slack extra**: install with `pip install "aethergraph[slack]"` if you need Slack channel integration.
* **UI shows no apps/agents**:

  * Make sure your module (e.g. `demos`) is importable under `--project-root`.
  * Ensure at least one graph has `as_app={...}` or `graph_fn` has `as_agent={...}`.

---

## Contributing (early phase)

* Use feature branches and open a PR against `main`.
* Keep public examples free of real secrets.
* Run tests locally before pushing.

Dev install:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest -q
```
