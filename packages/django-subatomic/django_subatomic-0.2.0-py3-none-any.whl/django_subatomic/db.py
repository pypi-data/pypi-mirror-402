# This is in contrast to the default behaviour of Django's `on_commit` function,
# where after-commit callbacks outside of transactions are executed immediately.
#
# We choose to disallow immediate execution because it can be misleading and hide bugs.
# In particular, it can hide the fact that a transaction is missing or on a different database,

# Tests are usually wrapped in a database transaction, which is rolled back when the test
# completes. This means that after-commit callbacks would usually never be run.

# outermost `transaction` or `transaction_if_not_already` context. This emulates how the application
# will behave when deployed and means that our tests are testing realistic application behaviour.
