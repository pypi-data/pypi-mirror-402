Example of running a HRTEM simulation
=====================================



Prerequisites for running this example
--------------------------------------

Prior to running any scripts or Jupyter notebooks in the directory
``<root>/examples``, where ``<root>`` is the root of the ``prismatique``
repository, a set of Python libraries need to be installed in the Python
environment within which any such scripts or Jupyter notebooks are to be
executed. See :ref:`this page <examples_prerequisites_for_running_examples_sec>`
for instructions on how to do so.



Example description
-------------------

In this example, we simulate a HRTEM experiment involving the bilayer
:math:`\text{MoS}_2` sample that we defined in the
:ref:`atomic_coord_generator_example_sec` page. See the documentation for the
subpackage :mod:`prismatique.hrtem` for a discussion on the algorithm used to
simulate HRTEM experiments.



Code
----

Below is the code that performs the aforementioned HRTEM simulation. You can
also find the same code in the file ``<root>/examples/hrtem_sim/run.py`` of the
repository, where ``<root>`` is the root of the ``prismatique`` repository. To
run the script from the terminal, change into the directory containing said
script, and then issue the following command::

  python run.py

The output files generated by this script are saved in the directory
``<root>/examples/data/hrtem_sim_output``, where ``<root>`` is the root of the
``prismatique`` repository. To analyze the output, use the Jupyter notebook
``<root>/examples/output_data_analysis_notebooks/analyzing_hrtem_sim_output.ipynb``.

If you would like to modify this script for your own work, it is recommended
that you copy the original script and save it elsewhere outside of the git
repository so that the changes made are not tracked by git.
