Prismatique
===========

``prismatique`` is a Python library that functions essentially as a wrapper to
the Python library ``pyprismatic``, which itself is a thin wrapper to
``prismatic``, a CUDA/C++ package for fast image simulations in scanning
transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy. You can find more information about ``pyprismatic`` and
``prismatic`` `here <https://prism-em.com/>`__.

The source code can be found in the `prismatique GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mrfitzpa/prismatique>`_.
