# RDF-StarBase Roadmap

**From Alpha to Industry Standard**

---

## Current Status: Alpha Release Ready ✅

RDF-StarBase is **production-ready for early adopters**. The core functionality is complete, tested, and benchmarked.

### What's Done (v0.1.0)

| Category | Features | Tests |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Core Storage** | Dictionary-encoded columnar storage, RDF-Star native, Polars backend | ✅ |
| **SPARQL Query** | SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE | ✅ |
| **SPARQL Patterns** | OPTIONAL, UNION, MINUS, FILTER, BIND, VALUES, GRAPH | ✅ |
| **Property Paths** | Sequence `/`, Alternative `\|`, Inverse `^`, Modifiers `*`, `+`, `?` | ✅ |
| **Aggregates** | COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP_CONCAT, SAMPLE, GROUP BY, HAVING | ✅ |
| **SPARQL Update** | INSERT DATA, DELETE DATA, DELETE WHERE, DELETE/INSERT WHERE | ✅ |
| **Graph Management** | Named graphs, CREATE, DROP, CLEAR, COPY, MOVE, ADD, LOAD | ✅ |
| **Time-Travel** | AS OF clause for temporal queries | ✅ |
| **Formats** | Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML, JSON-LD (parse + serialize) | ✅ |
| **Persistence** | Parquet-based save/load | ✅ |
| **Reasoning** | RDFS + OWL (subClassOf, sameAs, inverseOf, transitiveProperty) | ✅ |
| **AI Grounding** | /ai/query, /ai/verify, /ai/context, /ai/materialize | ✅ |
| **REST API** | FastAPI endpoints for all features | ✅ |
| **rdflib Compat** | Drop-in replacement layer | ✅ |
| **Visualization** | React + D3 graph visualization | ✅ |

**Test Suite:** 491 tests, 72% coverage  
**Benchmarks:** 10-72x faster than rdflib

- [ ] **PyPI publication** (`pip install rdf-starbase`)
- [ ] **Documentation site** (GitHub Pages or ReadTheDocs)
- [ ] **Quickstart guide** with runnable examples
- [ ] **API reference** (auto-generated from docstrings)
- [ ] **Benchmark reproducibility** (Docker or GitHub Actions)

**Marketing:**
- Add to Ontus.io product page

- Post on r/semanticweb, HackerNews, Twitter/X

---

### v0.2.0 — Beta (Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Production hardening based on early adopter feedback

#### Performance Enhancements
- [ ] Lazy loading for large graphs (> 10M triples)
- [ ] Query plan caching
- [ ] Parallel query execution for independent patterns
- [ ] Memory-mapped Parquet for out-of-core processing

#### SPARQL Completeness
- [ ] Subqueries (nested SELECT in WHERE clause)
- [ ] EXISTS / NOT EXISTS
- [ ] Property path with fixed length `{n,m}`
- [ ] COALESCE, IF, BOUND functions

#### Persistence Enhancements
- [ ] DuckDB backend option (SQL interface to Parquet, analytical workloads)
- [ ] Incremental persistence (append-only, avoid full rewrites)
- [ ] Streaming load for large Parquet files

---

### v0.3.0 — Trust & Governance (Q3 2026)

**Goal:** Enterprise features for data governance

#### Trust Scoring
- [ ] Configurable trust policies per source
- [ ] Confidence decay over time
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies (most-recent, highest-confidence, manual)
- [ ] Trust inheritance for inferred facts

#### Governance Workflows
- [ ] Approval workflows for assertions
- [ ] Audit log export
- [ ] Data lineage visualization
- [ ] Source health monitoring

---

### v1.0.0 — Production (Q4 2026)

**Goal:** Enterprise-grade, federation-ready

#### Federation
- [ ] SERVICE clause (SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query)
- [ ] Cross-instance synchronization
- [ ] Distributed query planning

#### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Authentication & authorization
- [ ] Multi-tenancy
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing

#### Certification
- [ ] W3C SPARQL 1.1 compliance test suite
- [ ] RDF-Star Working Group test suite
- [ ] Security audit

## Non-Goals (By Design)

These are **not planned** because they conflict with our architecture:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Disk-based triple store** | We're columnar-first; use Parquet/DuckDB for persistence |
| **Full-text search built-in** | Integrate with external FTS (Elasticsearch, Typesense) |
| **OWL 2 Full reasoning** | Computational complexity; we support useful OWL subsets |
| **SHACL validation** | Planned as separate package (`rdf-starbase-shacl`) |

## How to Contribute

### Priority Areas
1. **Bug reports** — File issues with reproducible examples
2. **SPARQL edge cases** — Complex queries that fail or produce wrong results
3. **Performance regressions** — Queries that are slower than expected
4. **Documentation** — Tutorials, how-tos, and examples

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all 491+ tests pass
5. Submit a pull request
