# TOPSIS-Daksh-102303322

for: **UCS654**   submitted by: **Daksh Garg**  Roll no: **102303322**  Group: **3C24**

topsis-daksh is a Python library for dealing with Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install topsis-daksh.

```bash
pip install topsis-daksh-102303322
```

## How TOPSIS Works

The TOPSIS method evaluates each alternative by calculating:

● The shortest distance from the ideal best solution

● The farthest distance from the ideal worst solution

Each alternative is then assigned:

● A TOPSIS score

● A rank, where rank 1 represents the best alternative

## Usage

Run the package using the command line interface (CLI). The syntax requires four arguments: the input data file, the weights, the impacts and the output file

```bash
topsis <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputFile>
```

## Example:

```bash
topsis sample.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,-,+,+" output.csv
```

## Important Notes on Syntax:

● Weights: Comma-separated numbers (e.g., 1,1,1,1).

● Impacts: Comma-separated signs (+ for beneficial criteria, - for non-beneficial criteria).

● Quotes: It is recommended to enclose your weights and impacts in double quotes (" ") to prevent errors if your input contains spaces.

## Getting Help: 

To view the help message and quick usage guide, run:

```bash
topsis /h
```

## Example

sample.csv

A csv file showing data for different car models having varying features.

| Model | Price (In lakhs) | Fuel Efficiency (Km/Lit) | Comfort | Looks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Car1 | 4 | 15 | Good | Average |
| Car2 | 8 | 16 | Good | Good |
| Car3 | 10 | 17 | Excellent | Excellent |
| Car4 | 3.5 | 16 | Average | Average |

Note: Categorical values have been converted to numerical scales (Good=4, Average=3, Excellent=5).

weights vector = [ 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 ]

impacts vector = [ - , + , + , + ]

Note: Price is a cost (-) factor, while Efficiency, Comfort, and Looks are benefit (+) factors.

## input:

```bash
topsis sample.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "-,+,+,+" output.csv
```

## output:

```bash 
Model  Price  Fuel Efficiency  Comfort  Looks  Topsis Score  Rank
 Car1    4.0               15        4      3      0.602439     1
 Car2    8.0               16        4      4      0.384213     4
 Car3   10.0               17        5      5      0.436903     3
 Car4    3.5               16        3      3      0.566388     2
```

## Other Notes

● Input File Format: The input CSV must contain a header row. The first column is treated as the object/alternative name (e.g., Model Name, M1, M2) and will be preserved in the output but excluded from the mathematical calculations.

● Numeric Data Only: Ensure that all columns from the 2nd column onwards contain strictly numeric values. Categorical values (e.g., "Good", "Medium") must be converted to numerical scales before running the script.

● Consistency: The number of values in your weights and impacts parameters must match the number of criteria columns (total columns minus one).
