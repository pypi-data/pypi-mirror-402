"""
Complexity Robotics Module
==========================

Adapts Complexity model for real-time robotics control.

Key features:
- Multi-modal tokenization (vision, proprio, actions)
- Real-time inference optimized for edge devices
- Action decoding to motor commands
- Control loop integration

Token-Routed MLP is particularly suited for robotics:
- Expert 0: Vision features (high frequency tokens)
- Expert 1: Proprioception (joint positions, velocities)
- Expert 2: Action history (previous commands)
- Expert 3: Language/goals (instructions)
