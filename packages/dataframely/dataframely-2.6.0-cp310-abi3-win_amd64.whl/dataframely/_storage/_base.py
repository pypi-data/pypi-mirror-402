    A storage backend encapsulates a way of serializing and deserializing dataframlely
    data-/lazyframes and collections. This base class provides a unified interface for
    all such use cases.

    The interface is designed to operate on data provided as polars frames, and metadata
    provided as serialized strings. This design is meant to limit the coupling between
    the Schema/Collection classes and specifics of how data and metadata is stored.
