def format_rule_failures(failures: list[tuple[str, int]]) -> str:
    """
    Format rule failures with the same logic that produces validation errors from the
    polars plugin.

    Args:
        failures: The name of the failures and their counts. This should only include
            failures with a count of at least 1.

    Returns:
        The formatted rule failures.

def regex_matching_string_length(regex: str) -> tuple[int, int | None]:
    """
    Compute the minimum and maximum length (if available) of strings matching a regular expression.

    Args:
        regex: The regular expression to analyze. The regular expression must not
            contain any lookaround operators.

    Returns:
        A tuple of the minimum of maximum length of the matching strings. While the minimum
        length is guaranteed to be available, the maximum length may be `None` if `regex`
        matches strings of potentially infinite length (e.g. due to the use of `+` or `*`).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the regex cannot be parsed or analyzed.

def regex_sample(

) -> list[str]:
    """
    Sample a random (set of) string(s) matching the provided regular expression.

    Args:
        regex: The regular expression generated strings must match. The regular
            expression must not contain any lookaround operators.
        n: The number of random strings to generate or `None` if a single one should
            be generated.
        max_repetitions: The maximum number of repetitions for `+` and `*`
            quantifiers.
        seed: The seed to use for the random sampling procedure.

    Returns:
        A single randomly generated string if `n is None` or a list of randomly
        generated strings if `n` is an integer.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the regex cannot be parsed.

    Attention:
        Using wildcards (i.e. `.`) really means _any_ valid Unicode character.
        Consider using more precise regular expressions if this is undesired.
