## How do I define additional unique keys in a {class}`~dataframely.Schema`?

By default, `dataframely` only supports defining a single non-nullable (composite) primary key in :class:
`~dataframely.Schema`.
However, in some scenarios it may be useful to define additional unique keys (which support nullable fields and/or which
are additionally unique).

Consider the following example, which demonstrates two rules: one for validating that a field is entirely unique, and
another for validating that a field, when provided, is unique.

```python
class UserSchema(dy.Schema):
    user_id = dy.UInt64(primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    username = dy.String(nullable=False)
    email = dy.String(nullable=True)  # Must be unique, or null.

    @dy.rule(group_by=["username"])
    def unique_username(cls) -> pl.Expr:
        """Username, a non-nullable field, must be total unique."""
        return pl.len() == 1

    @dy.rule()
    def unique_email_or_null(cls) -> pl.Expr:
        """Email must be unique, if provided."""
        return pl.col("email").is_null() | pl.col("email").is_unique()
```

## How do I fix the ruff error `First argument of a method should be named self`?

See our documentation on [group rules](./quickstart.md#group-rules).

## What versions of `polars` does `dataframely` support?

Our CI automatically tests `dataframely` for a minimal supported version of `polars`, which is currently `1.35.*`,
and the latest stable version.
We aim to extend support for new `polars` versions as they are released.

If your `polars` version is not in the range of supported versions, `dataframely` may still work, but you may
encounter unexpected issues.
