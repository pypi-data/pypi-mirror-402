## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Markdown Widget Initialization Error**: Fixed "Markdown widget not initialized. compose() must be called first" error in streaming message display
  - **Root Cause**: `write_initial_content()` and `append_content()` methods were being called before Textual's `compose()` method had initialized the markdown widget
  - **Solution**: Added `on_mount()` method to `StreamingMessageBase` that safely handles content writing after widget is properly mounted and composed
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Modified `write_initial_content()` to check if markdown widget is initialized before writing content
    - Modified `append_content()` to defer content updates until widget is properly composed
    - Updated `ReasoningMessage.on_mount()` to call parent method for consistent behavior
    - Added safety checks to prevent runtime errors while maintaining all existing functionality
  - **Files Changed**: `revibe/cli/textual_ui/widgets/messages.py` (lines 83-93, 114-121, 128-136, 217-224)
  - **Testing**: Application now starts and runs without the initialization error, with smooth streaming message display

  - All 6 antigravity models now only support XML format (`supported_formats=["xml"]`)
  - Auto-switches `tool_format` to XML when using antigravity models via `effective_tool_format` property
  - Native tool calling disabled: `get_available_tools()` returns `None`, `get_tool_choice()` returns `None`
  - Tool definitions embedded in system prompt via `_get_xml_tool_section()`
  - Updated `agent.py` and `system_prompt.py` to use `effective_tool_format` for consistent behavior

- **Antigravity Thinking Support**: Added `thinkingConfig` for thinking-capable models
  - Added `supports_thinking` field to `ModelConfig` to track thinking capability
  - Updated antigravity thinking models with `supports_thinking=True`:
    - `antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking`
    - `antigravity-claude-opus-4-5-thinking`
    - `antigravity-gemini-3-pro-high`
    - `antigravity-gemini-3-pro-low`
  - Added `thinkingConfig` to API requests for thinking models:
    - `thinkingBudget: -1` (unlimited)
    - `includeThoughts: true`
  - Based on reference implementation from AIClient-2-API

- **XML Tool Call Handling**: Enhanced message history management for XML format
  - Added `_is_xml_mode()` helper to detect XML format handler
  - Added `_has_xml_tool_calls()` to detect `<tool_call>` blocks in message content
  - Updated `_fill_missing_tool_responses()` to handle both native and XML tool calls
    - Native: Checks `msg.tool_calls` (existing behavior preserved)
    - XML: Parses `<tool_call>` blocks from content, counts expected vs actual responses
  - Updated `_ensure_assistant_after_tools()` to handle XML tool responses
    - Native: Checks `Role.tool` messages
    - XML: Checks for `<tool_result>` messages (Role.user with XML content)

### Fixed

- **Antigravity Backend 400 Bad Request Error**: Complete fix for API compatibility issues
  - **System Message Handling**: Fixed system prompts incorrectly placed in contents array
    - Moved system messages to `systemInstruction` field with required `role: "user"`
    - Contents array now only contains `user` and `model` roles as required by API
  - **Request Payload Structure**: Added missing required fields and removed unsupported fields
    - Added `sessionId` field with format `"-{random_number}"` for all requests
    - Removed `maxOutputTokens` from generationConfig (not supported by Antigravity)
  - **Tool Configuration**: Fixed tool calling mode and schema validation
    - Set `VALIDATED` mode for all models with tools (required by Antigravity API)
    - Previously only applied to Claude models, now applies to all models
    - Added recursive cleaning of disallowed fields from tool schemas
    - Removes: `$schema`, `$ref`, `$defs`, `const`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `definitions`, `title`, `examples`, `default`
  - **Tool Call Format**: Corrected function call/response formatting
    - Model tool calls use `functionCall` format (not `functionResponse`)
    - User tool responses use `functionResponse` format with proper ID matching
  - **API Compliance**: All changes based on reference implementation from AIClient-2-API
    - Verified with actual API calls to ensure compatibility
    - Tested with complex tool schemas containing disallowed fields
    - Confirmed working with both simple and complex tool definitions

- **Model Selection with Slash in Names**: Fixed issue where models with `/` in their name (e.g., `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1`) were incorrectly parsed
  - Changed provider/model separator from `/` to `<>` to avoid conflicts with model names containing slashes
  - Old format: `provider/alias` (e.g., `chutes/glm-4.7`) - still supported but deprecated
  - New format: `provider<>alias` (e.g., `kilocode<>x-ai/grok-code-fast-1`)
  - Models with `/` in their names now work correctly by using the `active_provider` field instead of parsing the separator
  - Fixes error: `Model 'grok-code-fast-1' not found for provider 'x-ai'` when selecting models like `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` from KiloCode provider

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-02

### Added

  - Provider-aware selection using `active_provider` context
  - Fallback to first matching alias when no provider context is set
  - Model selector now saves both `active_model` and `active_provider` for accurate routing

### Fixed

- **Chutes Provider Routing**: Fixed issue where Chutes provider requests were being sent to HuggingFace
  - Root cause: duplicate model aliases (e.g., `glm-4.7`) existed in both providers
  - The first match in the model list was being used without considering the intended provider
  - Now correctly routes to the selected provider based on user's selection in the model UI

- **Antigravity/GeminiCLI Tool Schema**: Fixed `read_file` tool being called with empty arguments
  - Added `_extract_property_type()` helper method to handle complex JSON Schema types
  - Properly handles `anyOf`/`oneOf` constructs generated by Pydantic for optional fields
  - Ensures correct type extraction for tool parameters passed to LLMs

  - The API sends tool call args as dict, but `FunctionCall.arguments` field is typed as `str`
  - Pydantic was coercing dicts to invalid string representation (`"{'pattern': ...}"`) instead of JSON
  - Fixed by serializing args dict to JSON string in `_parse_tool_calls()` before Pydantic sees it
  - Added defensive check in `_prepare_messages()` for any non-string arguments

### Fixed

- Added `revibe/__main__.py` to enable `python -m revibe` command execution on all devices

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- Support for XML-based tool calling via `--tool-format xml` flag.

- `XMLToolFormatHandler` for robust parsing of XML tool calls and generation of XML tool results.
- `supported_formats` field in `ModelConfig` and backend implementations to manage compatibility.
- Dynamic tool prompt resolution in `BaseTool` allowing automatic fallback to standard prompts if XML version is missing.
- First public release of ReVibe with all core functionality.
- New models added to Hugging Face provider.
- Animated "ReVibe" text logo in setup completion screen with gradient colors.
- Provider help URLs for all API key requiring providers (Hugging Face, Cerebras).

### Changed

- ReVibe configuration and data now saved in `.revibe` directory (migrated from `.vibe`).

  - Display setup completion screen with "Press Enter to exit" instruction
  - Hide configuration documentation links from completion screen
  - Show usage message "Use 'revibe' to start using ReVibe" after setup completion

  - Refactored `StreamingMessageBase` in `revibe/cli/textual_ui/widgets/messages.py` to track `_displayed_content` for smart UI updates
  - Enhanced premium tool summaries in chat history:
    - Find now shows as `Find (pattern)` instead of `grep: 'pattern'`
    - Bash now shows as `Bash (command)` instead of raw command string
    - Read File now shows as `Read (filename)` with cleaner summary
    - Write File now shows as `Write (filename)`
    - Search & Replace now shows as `Patch (filename)`
  - Applied redaction logic to `ReasoningMessage` in `revibe/cli/textual_ui/widgets/messages.py` to hide raw XML in reasoning blocks
- Model alias validation now allows same aliases for different providers while maintaining uniqueness within each provider.

### Fixed
