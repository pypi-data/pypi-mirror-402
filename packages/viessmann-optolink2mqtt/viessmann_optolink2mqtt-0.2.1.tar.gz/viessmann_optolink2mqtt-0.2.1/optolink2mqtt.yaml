    # each register of the Viessmann device has a few key attributes you need to know/discover:

    register: 0x0101
    length: 2
    scale_factor: 0.1

    # the whole "ha_discovery" section is optional and is useful only if you have

      unit_of_measurement: "°C"          # for a list of supported measurement units check https://github.com/f18m/viessmann-optolink2mqtt/blob/main/src/optolink2mqtt/ha_units.py


  # another register example, showing a different measurement unit:

  - name: dhw_electric_energy_kwh
    sampling_period_seconds: 600
    register: 0x1670
    length: 4
    scale_factor: 0.1

      name: "Domestic Hot Water Electric Energy kWh"
      platform: sensor
      device_class: energy
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"

  
  # another register example, showing an enumerated value:

  - name: heating_circuit_1_mode
    sampling_period_seconds: 20
    register: 0xB000
    length: 1
    scale_factor: 1
    signed: false
    enum:
      0: "Off"
      1: "DHW only"
      2: "Heating/Cooling/DHW (time program)"
      4: "Permanently reduced"
      5: "Permanently normal"
      6: "Normal/Off (time program)"
      7: "Cooling only"
    ha_discovery:

  # another register example, showing a binary_sensor of type "running":

  - name: heating_circuit_pump
    sampling_period_seconds: 20
    register: 0x0484
    length: 1
    scale_factor: 1

      payload_off: "0"


  # yet another example, showing the "byte_filter" feature:
  # this is useful because in some cases the Viessmann register is 3 bytes long,
  # but only 2 bytes are relevant for the actual value; in this case you can
  # use the "byte_filter" to specify which bytes should be considered when
  # extracting the value from the register raw data.

  - name: dhw_temperature_top
    sampling_period_seconds: 20
    register: 0x01CD
    length: 3
    scale_factor: 0.1
    byte_filter: "b:0:1"  # of the 3 bytes, consider only the first two bytes; then apply the scale factor
    signed: true
    ha_discovery:
      name: "Domestic Hot Water Top Temperature"
      platform: sensor
      device_class: temperature
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"


  # PLEASE NOTE THAT DISCOVERING THE CORRECT REGISTERS TO POLL IS
  # SOMETHING YOU NEED TO DO BY YOURSELF, AS IT DEPENDS ON THE
  # MODEL OF YOUR VIESSMANN DEVICE AND ITS CONFIGURATION.
  # Check the README of this project for some hints on that.
