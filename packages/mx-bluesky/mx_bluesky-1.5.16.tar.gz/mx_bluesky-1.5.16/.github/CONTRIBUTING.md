# How to contribute to mx-bluesky

We should prioritise working, agile code over strict standards, particularly for contributors that are not full time developers. The standards below are thus guidelines that developers should try to follow as much as possible (apart from when something is specified in bold, which is required).

Contributions and issues are most welcome! All issues and pull requests are handled through [GitHub](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/mx-bluesky/issues). Also, please check for any existing issues before filing a new one. If you have a great idea but it involves big changes, please file a ticket before making a pull request! We want to make sure you don't spend your time coding something that might not fit the scope of the project.

## General Workflow

1. An issue is created for the work. This issue should describe in as much detail as possible the work that needs to be done. Anyone is free to make a ticket and/or comment on one.
2. If a developer is going to do the work they assign themselves to the issue.
3. The developer makes a new branch with the format `issue_short_description` e.g. `122_create_a_contributing_file`. (External developers are also welcome to make forks)
4. The developer does the work on this branch, adding their work in small commits. Commit messages should be informative and prefixed with the issue number e.g. `(#122) Added contributing file`.
5. The developer submits a PR for the work. In the pull request should start with `Fixes #issue_num` e.g. `Fixes #122`, this will ensure the issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged. The developer should also add some background on how the reviewer might test the change.
6. If the developer has a particular person in mind to review the work they should assign that person to the PR as a reviewer.
7. The reviewer and developer go back and forth on the code until the reviewer approves it. (See "Reviewing Work" below)
8. Once the work is approved the original developer merges it.

**Work should not be done without an associated ticket describing what the work is**

## Developing mx-bluesky and dodal

Some issues will span the mx-bluesky repo and the dodal repo. When working on both at the same time, follow these instructions:
1. An issue is created for the work, inside mx-bluesky. This issue should describe in as much detail as possible the work that needs to be done. Anyone is free to make a ticket and/or comment on one.
2. If a developer is going to do the work they assign themselves to the issue.
3. The developer makes a new branch in mx-bluesky with the format `issue_short_description` e.g. `122_create_a_contributing_file`. The developer also creates a new branch in dodal, with the format `mx_bluesky_issue_short_description` - the same as the mx-bluesky branch name but with `mx_bluesky_` in front. (External developers are also welcome to make forks)
4. The developer does the work on these branches, adding their work in small commits. Commit messages should be informative and prefixed with the issue number e.g. `(#122) Added contributing file`.
5. Once the developer has done the final commit in both repos, they find the latest commit SHA in the dodal repo using `git log`. In `mx-bluesky/pyproject.toml`, the developer changes `dls-dodal @ git+https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dodal.git@{dodal_commmit_SHA}` using the SHA they just found.
6. The developer commits and pushes this final change on mx-bluesky.
7. The developer submits a dodal PR for the work they have done in the dodal repo. The pull request should start with `Fixes #issue_num` e.g. `Fixes #122`, and should link to the issue created in mx-bluesky. The developer should also add some background on how the reviewer might test the change.
8. The developer submits a mx-bluesky PR for the work they have done in the mx-bluesky repo. The pull request should start with `Fixes #issue_num` e.g. `Fixes #122`. This PR should link to the dodal PR just created with something like "Also needs #456". Again, the developer should add some background on how the reviewer might test the change.
9. If the developer has a particular person in mind to review the work they should assign that person to the PRs as a reviewer.
10. The reviewer and developer go back and forth on the code until the reviewer approves it. (See "Reviewing Work" below)
11. Once the work is approved on both PRs, the original developer merges them. The PRs should be merged at the same time.

**Work should not be done without an associated ticket describing what the work is**

## Reviewing Work

**Work must be reviewed by another developer before it can be merged**. Remember that work is reviewed for a number of reasons:

- In order to maintain quality and avoid errors
- Help people learn

It is not a judgement on someone's technical abilities so be kind.

It is suggested that the reviewer prefixes comments with something like the following:

- **must**: A change that must be made before merging e.g. it will break something if not made
- **should/sugg**: A change that should be made e.g. definitely improves code quality but does not neccessarily break anything
- **nit**: A minor suggestion that the reviewer would like to see but is happy to leave as is e.g. rename a variable to something

Developers are welcome to ignore **nit** comments if they wish and can choose not to do **should** comments but the must give a reason as to why they disagree with the change.

For minor changes to code reviewers are welcome to make the changes themselves but in this case the original developer should then recheck what the reviewer has done.

When beginning to review a PR, it is recommended to assign the PR to yourself on GitHub so that other developers know that this code is already being reviewed. If you decide you cannot complete the review, remember to unassign yourself from this PR to let others know.

## Issue or Discussion?

Github also offers [discussions](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/mx-bluesky/discussions) as a place to ask questions and share ideas. If
your issue is open ended and it is not obvious when it can be "closed", please
raise it as a discussion instead.

## Code Coverage

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it significantly
reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure coverage remains the
same or is improved by a pull request!

## Developer Information

It is recommended that developers use a [vscode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). This repository contains configuration to set up a containerized development environment that suits its own needs.

This project was created using the [Diamond Light Source Copier Template](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-copier-template) for Python projects.

For more information on common tasks like setting up a developer environment, running the tests, and setting a pre-commit hook, see the template's [How-to guides](https://diamondlightsource.github.io/python-copier-template/5.0.1/how-to.html).
