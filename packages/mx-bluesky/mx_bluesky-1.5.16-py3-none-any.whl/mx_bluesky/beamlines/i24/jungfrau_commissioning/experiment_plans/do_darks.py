    When Bluesky triggers the detector in pedestal mode, with pedestal frames F and pedestal loops L,
    the acquisition is managed at the driver level to:
    1. Acquire F-1 frames in dynamic gain mode
    2. Acquire 1 frame in ForceSwitchG1 gain mode

    4. Do the first three steps a second time, except use ForceSwitchG2 instead of ForceSwitchG1

    A pedestal scan should be acquired when detector configuration and environmental conditions change, but due to small
    in instabilities in beamline conditions, it is recommended to run a pedestal scan on roughly an hourly basis.
