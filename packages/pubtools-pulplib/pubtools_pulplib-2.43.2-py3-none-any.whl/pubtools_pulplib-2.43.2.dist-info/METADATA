```
pip install pubtools-pulplib
```


Usage Example
-------------

```python
from pubtools.pulplib import Client

# Make a client pointing at this Pulp server
with Client(url='https://pulp.example.com/', auth=('admin', 'some-password')) as client:

  # Get a particular repo by ID.
  # All methods return Future instances; .result() blocks
  repo = client.get_repository('zoo').result()

  # Pulp objects have relevant methods, e.g. publish().
  # Returned future may encapsulate one or more Pulp tasks.
  publish = repo.publish().result()
```
