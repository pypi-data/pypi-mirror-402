dcor: distance correlation and energy statistics in Python.

E-statistics are functions of distances between statistical observations
in metric spaces.

Distance covariance and distance correlation are
dependency measures between random vectors introduced in [SRB07]_ with
a simple E-statistic estimator.

This package offers functions for calculating several E-statistics
such as:

- Estimator of the energy distance [SR13]_.
- Biased and unbiased estimators of distance covariance and
  distance correlation [SRB07]_.
- Estimators of the partial distance covariance and partial
  distance covariance [SR14]_.

It also provides tests based on these E-statistics:

- Test of homogeneity based on the energy distance.
- Test of independence based on distance covariance.

Installation
============

dcor is on PyPi and can be installed using :code:`pip`:

.. code::

   pip install dcor
   
It is also available for :code:`conda` using the :code:`conda-forge` channel:

.. code::

   conda install -c conda-forge dcor
   
Previous versions of the package were in the :code:`vnmabus` channel. This
channel will not be updated with new releases, and users are recommended to
use the :code:`conda-forge` channel.

Requirements
------------

dcor is available in Python 3.8 or above in all operating systems.
The package dcor depends on the following libraries:

- numpy
- numba >= 0.51
- scipy
- joblib
