    gRPC Transcoding

     gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
     more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
     that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
     APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
     [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
     Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
     and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
     and use it for large scale production services.

     `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
     how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
     path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
     gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
     typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.

     Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
     template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
     as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
     The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
     the URL path.

     Example:

         service Messaging {
           rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
             option (google.api.http) = {
                 get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
             };
           }
         }
         message GetMessageRequest {
           string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
         }
         message Message {
           string text = 1; // The resource content.
         }

     This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:

     - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
     - gRPC: `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`

     Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
     automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
     For example:

         service Messaging {
           rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
             option (google.api.http) = {
                 get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
             };
           }
         }
         message GetMessageRequest {
           message SubMessage {
             string subfield = 1;
           }
           string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
           int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
           SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
         }

     This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:

     - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo`
     - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub:
     SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`

     Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
     primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
     In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
     as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
     message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
     `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.

     For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
     specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
     message resource collection:

         service Messaging {
           rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
             option (google.api.http) = {
               patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
               body: "message"
             };
           }
         }
         message UpdateMessageRequest {
           string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
           Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
         }

     The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
     representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
     protos JSON encoding:

     - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
     - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`

     The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
     every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
     request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
     the update method:

         service Messaging {
           rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
             option (google.api.http) = {
               patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
               body: "*"
             };
           }
         }
         message Message {
           string message_id = 1;
           string text = 2;
         }


     The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:

     - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
     - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`

     Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
     have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
     the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
     defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
     which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.

     It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
     the `additional_bindings` option. Example:

         service Messaging {
           rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
             option (google.api.http) = {
               get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
               additional_bindings {
                 get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
               }
             };
           }
         }
         message GetMessageRequest {
           string message_id = 1;
           string user_id = 2;
         }

     This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:

     - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
     - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`

     - HTTP: `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456`
     - gRPC: `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`

     Rules for HTTP mapping

     1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
        message) are classified into three categories:
        - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
        - Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They
        are passed via the HTTP
          request body.
        - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
          parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
          field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
          name.
      2. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is "*", there is no URL
      query parameter, all fields
         are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
      3. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP
      request body, all
         fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.

     Path template syntax

         Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
         Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
         Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
         Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
         FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
         Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;

     The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
     zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
     except the `Verb`.

     The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
     template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
     matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
     is equivalent to `{var=*}`.

     The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
     contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
     before the matching.

     If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
     `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
     side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
     server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
     [Discovery
     Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
     `{var}`.

     If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
     or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
     client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
     The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
     unchanged. Such variables show up in the
     [Discovery
     Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
     `{+var}`.

     Using gRPC API Service Configuration

     gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
     for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
     service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
     proto message.

     As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
     transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
     `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
     effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
     have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
     specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
     configuration in the proto.

     The following example selects a gRPC method and applies an `HttpRule` to it:

         http:
           rules:
             - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
               get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}

     Special notes

     When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
     proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
     specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).

     While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
     [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
     Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
     3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
     does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
     to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
     for multi segment variables.

     The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
     because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.

     The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
     is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
     character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.

     Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
     no client library can support such complicated mapping.

     If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
     the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
     Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.
