    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's Kawaii agent.

    **ANAC 2015 Individual Utility Category Runner-up**.

    Kawaii is a negotiation agent that uses Simulated Annealing for bid
    search and a time-dependent conceding strategy. It adapts its
    acceptance threshold based on the number of accepting opponents in
    multilateral negotiations.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Uses Simulated Annealing to search for bids near the target utility:

    1. First attempts relative utility search (for linear utility spaces)
       by selecting values that sum to the target concession amount
    2. Falls back to Simulated Annealing with parameters:
       - Start temperature: 1.0
       - End temperature: 0.0001
       - Cooling rate: 0.999

    The search minimizes the distance to target utility while staying
    above it. Returns the maximum utility bid if no suitable bid found.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Time-dependent threshold with conceder behavior (exponent = 2):

    $$threshold(t) = 1 - (1 - a) \cdot t^2$$

    where a = 0.8 is the minimum threshold.

    In multilateral scenarios, the threshold is reduced based on how
    many opponents have already accepted:

    $$threshold -= (threshold - minThreshold) \cdot \frac{acceptCount}{numOpponents}$$

    This encourages acceptance when close to agreement.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Tracks which opponents have made accepting moves (offered bids
    close to previous offers). This information adjusts the acceptance
    threshold to facilitate agreement when multiple parties are close
    to consensus.
