    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's AgentKN.

    **ANAC 2017 Nash Product Category Finalist**.

    AgentKN by Keita Nakamura uses Simulated Annealing for bid search and
    a sophisticated opponent modeling approach to estimate the maximum
    utility the opponent might offer. It balances self-utility maximization
    with opponent value frequency analysis.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Uses Simulated Annealing to search for 10 bids that maximize utility
    while starting from a random initial bid. The bids are then scored
    using a combined metric:

    $$score = utility + 0.1^{(\log_{10}(frequency)+1)} \cdot frequency \cdot utility$$

    where frequency is the sum of opponent-offered value frequencies.
    This encourages bids that are both high-utility and contain values
    the opponent has frequently requested.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Accepts when the opponent's bid exceeds a dynamic threshold:

    $$threshold(t) = 1 - (1 - e_{max}(t)) \cdot t^\alpha$$

    where alpha > 1 controls concession rate and e_max(t) is the
    estimated maximum utility the opponent might offer, calculated as:

    $$e_{max}(t) = \mu(t) + (1 - \mu(t)) \cdot d(t)$$

    $$d(t) = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sigma(t)}{\sqrt{\mu(t) \cdot (1 - \mu(t))}}$$

    where mu(t) is the mean and sigma(t) is the standard deviation of
    utilities from opponent offers.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Tracks value frequencies for each issue across opponent bids:

    - Updates issue weights when consecutive bids have the same value
    - Maintains normalized value frequency counts per issue
    - Uses statistical analysis (mean, std) of opponent bid utilities
      to estimate the opponent's bidding range
