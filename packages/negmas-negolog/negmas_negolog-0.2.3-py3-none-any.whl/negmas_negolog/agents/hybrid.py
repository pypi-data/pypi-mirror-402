    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's HybridAgent.

    HybridAgent combines Time-Based and Behavior-Based negotiation strategies
    using a Bezier curve for time-based concession and weighted opponent
    move mirroring for behavior-based adaptation. It was developed for
    emotional and opponent-aware human-robot negotiation research.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Combines two strategies with time-varying weights:

    1. **Time-Based (Bezier curve)**:

    $$target_{time}(t) = (1-t)^2 p_0 + 2(1-t)t \cdot p_1 + t^2 \cdot p_2$$

    where p0=1.0, p1=0.75, p2=0.55 (bounded by reservation value).

    2. **Behavior-Based**: Mirrors opponent concession moves using a
    weighted window of recent utility differences:

    - Window weights: {1: [1], 2: [0.25, 0.75], 3: [0.11, 0.22, 0.66],
      4: [0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5]}
    - Empathy parameter p3=0.5 controls response magnitude

    Combined target (after first 2 rounds):

    $$target = (1-t^2) \cdot target_{behavior} + t^2 \cdot target_{time}$$

    This starts behavior-focused and shifts to time-based near deadline.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    AC_Next strategy: accepts if opponent's last offer utility exceeds
    the current target utility. Simple but effective when combined
    with the hybrid target calculation.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Implicit modeling through behavior-based component:

    - Tracks utility differences between consecutive opponent offers
    - Uses weighted window to emphasize recent moves (recent moves
      have higher weight)
    - Adapts own concession rate based on opponent's concession pattern
    - Empathy factor increases with time: (p3 + p3 * t)
