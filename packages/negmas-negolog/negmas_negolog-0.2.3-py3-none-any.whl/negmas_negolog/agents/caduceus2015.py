    **ANAC 2015 Competition Agent**.

    Caduceus2015 by Taha Gunes is a sub-agent developed for the Caduceus
    multilateral negotiation system. It uses Nash product optimization
    to find mutually beneficial outcomes and employs frequency-based
    opponent modeling to estimate opponent preferences.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Two-phase bidding approach based on time:

    1. **Early phase (t < 0.83)**: Offers the best bid (maximum utility)
       to establish a strong opening position.

    2. **Later phase (t >= 0.83)**: Calculates Nash product across all
       parties using estimated opponent utility spaces:
       - Computes Nash bid that maximizes product of utilities
       - Uses CounterOfferGenerator to generate bids around Nash point
       - Ensures bid utility stays above reservation value (min 0.75)

    If generated bid has lower utility than opponent's last offer
    (by margin > 0.2), accepts instead.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Implicit acceptance based on bid comparison: if the opponent's
    previous bid has utility exceeding the generated counter-offer
    by more than 0.2, the agent accepts. This creates a dynamic
    acceptance threshold based on what the agent can offer.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Frequency-based preference estimation with time-weighted updates:

    - Tracks issue-value frequencies using a "round value" weight:

    $$roundValue = 2t^2 - 101t + 100$$

    This gives high weight to early observations that decreases
    over time.

    - Extra weight given to values that remain unchanged between
      consecutive opponent bids (stability bonus)
    - Constructs SaneUtilitySpace for each opponent to estimate
      their preferences
