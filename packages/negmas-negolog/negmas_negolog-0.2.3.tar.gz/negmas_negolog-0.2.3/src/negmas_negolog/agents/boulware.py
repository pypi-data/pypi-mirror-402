    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's BoulwareAgent.

    A "tough" time-based concession agent that concedes slowly (sub-linearly)
    over the negotiation deadline. Named after the negotiation tactic of being
    "hard-headed" early and only conceding near the deadline.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Uses a quadratic Bézier curve to calculate target utility over time:

    $$TU = (1-t)^2 P_0 + 2(1-t)t P_1 + t^2 P_2$$

    where t is normalized time [0,1], P0=1.0 (initial utility),
    P1=0.85 (control point), and P2=0.4 (final utility). The high P1 value
    (P1 >= (P0+P2)/2) creates a concave curve that maintains high utility
    demands until late in the negotiation.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Uses AC_Next: accepts if the opponent's last offer provides utility
    greater than or equal to the agent's current target utility.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    None. This is a pure time-based strategy that ignores opponent behavior.
