    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's ParsAgent.

    **ANAC 2015 Individual Utility Category Finalist**.

    ParsAgent by Zahra Khosravimehr from Amirkabir University of Technology
    uses a hybrid bidding strategy combining time-dependent, random, and
    frequency-based approaches to propose high-utility offers close to
    opponent preferences, increasing the likelihood of early agreement.

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Employs a multi-step bid generation process:

    1. First checks if there's a mutually beneficial bid from the
       intersection of both opponents' preferences (in multilateral).
    2. If not found, constructs a bid using:
       - Mutual issue values (agreed by both opponents based on frequency)
       - Own best values for non-mutual issues
    3. Falls back to modifying the best bid on the worst-weighted issue

    Target utility follows Boulware-style concession:

    $$target(t) = 1 - t^{1/e}$$

    where e = 0.15 (or 0.2 with discount factor). Minimum threshold is 0.7.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Simple time-dependent acceptance: accepts if opponent's offer
    utility exceeds the target utility at current time. The target
    decreases from 1.0 towards 0.7 following the Boulware curve.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Frequency-based modeling for each opponent:

    - Tracks repeated values for each issue across opponent bids
    - Identifies mutual preferences between opponents (values both
      opponents frequently request)
    - Maintains sorted list of opponent bids by utility
    - Searches for Nash-like outcomes using common preferences
