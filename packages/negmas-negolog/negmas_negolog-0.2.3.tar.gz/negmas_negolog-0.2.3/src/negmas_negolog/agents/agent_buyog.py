    NegMAS wrapper for NegoLog's AgentBuyog.

    **ANAC 2015 Individual Utility Category Runner-up**.

    AgentBuyog estimates the opponent's concession function using regression
    analysis and uses this to determine optimal acceptance thresholds. It
    also estimates opponent preferences to find bids near the Kalai point
    (social welfare maximum).

    **Offering Strategy:**
    Selects bids based on domain competitiveness and opponent difficulty:

    1. Calculates acceptance threshold based on estimated opponent
       difficulty and time-based concession:

    $$threshold = minPoint + (1 - minPoint) \cdot (1 - t^{1.8})$$

    2. Searches for bids at or above threshold that are closest to
       the estimated Kalai point (maximizing social welfare)
    3. If common bids exist (offered by multiple opponents), prefers
       those with highest utility

    Near deadline (remaining rounds <= 3), threshold is halved.

    **Acceptance Strategy:**
    Multi-criteria acceptance based on:

    - Most recent offer utility vs. threshold
    - Best agreeable bid utility (common to both opponents)
    - Generated bid utility

    Accepts if opponent's offer exceeds all other options and the
    acceptance threshold, especially when near deadline.

    **Opponent Modeling:**
    Sophisticated multi-component model:

    - **Concession estimation**: Uses weighted regression to fit
      exponential concession function exp(alpha) * t^beta to opponent
      bid utilities over time
    - **Leniency calculation**: Derived from slope of estimated
      concession curve, adjusted by a leniency factor
    - **Preference estimation**: Frequency-based issue weight and
      value estimation, normalized after each update
    - **Kalai point estimation**: Finds social welfare maximum
      using estimated opponent preferences
    - **Agent difficulty**: Combined metric of leniency and domain
      competitiveness to assess how hard to negotiate with
