## See It In Action

### CLI Demo

```
$ claude-meet chat

Claude Calendar Scheduler
Timezone: Europe/Berlin
Type 'help' for commands, 'exit' to quit
============================================================

You: Schedule a 1-hour meeting with alice@company.com and bob@company.com tomorrow

Claude: I'll find a time that works for everyone. Checking calendars...

Found these available slots for tomorrow:
  1. 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Recommended - prime morning time)
  2. 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (Good option)
  3. 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM

Which time works best? And what should I call this meeting?

You: Let's do 2pm, call it "Project Kickoff"

Claude: Done! I've created "Project Kickoff" for tomorrow 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM.
Calendar invites sent to alice@company.com and bob@company.com.
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Use Claude Meet directly in Claude Desktop - just ask Claude to schedule meetings naturally:

```
You: Check when sarah@example.com is free next Tuesday

Claude: I checked Sarah's calendar for next Tuesday. She's available:
  - 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM
  - 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM

Would you like me to schedule a meeting?
```

## Features

### Talk Naturally
No commands to memorize. No special syntax. Just tell Claude what you need.

```
"Find a time for a 30-minute sync with the design team next week"
"Schedule a demo with client@company.com on Friday afternoon"
"When is everyone free for a team lunch?"
```

### Smart Conflict Detection
Never double-book again. Claude Meet checks everyone's calendar before suggesting times.

### Intelligent Time Suggestions
Times are ranked by preference:
- Avoids early mornings and late evenings
- Respects lunch hours
- Prefers prime collaboration times (9-11 AM)

### Google Meet Integration
Add video conferencing with one word:

```
"Schedule a video call with remote-team@company.com tomorrow"
```

```

**How it works:**
1. You describe what you need in natural language
2. Claude interprets your request and calls the right tools
3. Calendar Client checks Google Calendar for availability
4. Scheduler ranks times by preference
5. Claude presents options and books your choice

```bash
claude-meet check
```

This shows what's configured and what needs attention.
