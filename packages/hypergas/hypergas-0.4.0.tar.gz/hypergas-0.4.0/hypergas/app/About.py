st.markdown('### Introduction')
st.markdown('Methane (CH$_4$) has a global warming potential 84 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 20 year period.\
            The waste management sector contributes 21.5% of total anthropogenic methane emissions,\
                with landfills accounting for 44% of these emissions. \
            Landfills are responsible for approximately 55% of the global uncertainty share of methane emissions. \
            This tool can be used to detect CH4 plumes from landfills using satellite data.\
            Feel free to use it for your own methane emission research.'

st.markdown('- Run `l2_plot.py` to visualize L2 data and export plots to HTML files.')
st.markdown('- Go to the **PlumeMarker** page to create source markers.')
