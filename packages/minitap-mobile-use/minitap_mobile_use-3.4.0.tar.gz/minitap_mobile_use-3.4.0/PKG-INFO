               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Mobile-use is a powerful, open-source AI agent that controls your Android or IOS device using natural language. It understands your commands and interacts with the UI to perform tasks, from sending messages to navigating complex apps.

> Mobile-use is quickly evolving. Your suggestions, ideas, and reported bugs will shape this project. Do not hesitate to join in the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6nSqmQ9pQs) or contribute directly, we will reply to everyone! ❤️

## ✨ Features

- 🗣️ **Natural Language Control**: Interact with your phone using your native language.
- 📱 **UI-Aware Automation**: Intelligently navigates through app interfaces (note: currently has limited effectiveness with games as they don't provide accessibility tree data).
- 📊 **Data Scraping**: Extract information from any app and structure it into your desired format (e.g., JSON) using a natural language description.
- 🔧 **Extensible & Customizable**: Easily configure different LLMs to power the agents that power mobile-use.

The official leaderboard is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cchzP9dlTZ3WXQTfYNhh3avxoLipqHN75v1Tb86uhHo/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to automate your mobile experience? Follow these steps to get mobile-use up and running.

### 🌐 From our Platform

Easiest way to get started is to use our Platform.
Follow our [Platform quickstart](https://docs.minitap.ai/mobile-use-sdk/platform-quickstart) to get started.

### 🛠️ From source

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your API keys.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Customize LLM Configuration:**
    To use different models or providers, create your own LLM configuration file.

    ```bash
    cp llm-config.override.template.jsonc llm-config.override.jsonc
    ```

    Then, edit `llm-config.override.jsonc` to fit your needs.

    You can also use local LLMs or any other openai-api compatible providers :

    1. Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`
    2. In your `llm-config.override.jsonc`, set `openai` as the provider for the agent nodes you want, and choose a model supported by your provider.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to use Google Vertex AI, you must either:
    >
    > - Have credentials configured for your environment (gcloud, workload identity, etc…)
    > - Store the path to a service account JSON file as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
    >
    > More information: - [Credential types](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC) - [google.auth API reference](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/reference/google.auth.html#module-google.auth)

### Quick Launch (Docker)

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart, is only available for Android devices/emulators as of now, and you must have Docker installed.

First:

- Either plug your Android device and enable USB-debugging via the Developer Options
- Or launch an Android emulator

Then run in your terminal:

1. For Linux/macOS:

```bash
chmod +x mobile-use.sh
bash ./mobile-use.sh \
  "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

2. For Windows (inside a Powershell terminal):

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File mobile-use.ps1 `
  "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" `
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If using your own device, make sure to accept the ADB-related connection requests that will pop up on your device.

#### 🧰 Troubleshooting

The script will try to connect to your device via IP.
Therefore, your device **must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer**.

##### 1. No device IP found

If the script fails with the following message:

```
Could not get device IP. Is a device connected via USB and on the same Wi-Fi network?
```

Then it couldn't find one of the common Wi-Fi interfaces on your device.
Therefore, you must determine what WLAN interface your phone is using via `adb shell ip addr show up`.
Then add the `--interface <YOUR_INTERFACE_NAME>` option to the script.

##### 2. Failed to connect to <DEVICE_IP>:5555 inside Docker

This is most probably an issue with your firewall blocking the connection. Therefore there is no clear fix for this.

##### 3. Failed to pull GHCR docker images (unauthorized)

Since UV docker images rely on a `ghcr.io` public repositories, you may have an expired token if you used `ghcr.io` before for private repositories.
Try running `docker logout ghcr.io` and then run the script again.

### Manual Launch (Development Mode)

For developers who want to set up the environment manually:

#### 1. Device Support

Mobile-use currently supports the following devices:

- **Physical Android Phones**: Connect via USB with USB debugging enabled.
- **Android Simulators**: Set up through Android Studio.
- **iOS Simulators**: Supported for macOS users.

> [!NOTE]
> Physical iOS devices are not yet supported.

#### 2. Prerequisites

**For Android:**

- **[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)**: A tool to connect to your device.

**For iOS (macOS only):**

- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)**: Apple's IDE for iOS development.
- **[fb-idb](https://fbidb.io/docs/installation/)**: Facebook's iOS Development Bridge for device automation.

  ```bash
  # Install via Homebrew (macOS)
  brew tap facebook/fb
  brew install idb-companion
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > `idb_companion` is required to communicate with iOS simulators. Make sure it's in your PATH after installation.

**Common requirements:**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: A lightning-fast Python package manager.

#### 3. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/minitap-ai/mobile-use.git && cd mobile-use
    ```

2.  [**Setup environment variables**](#-getting-started)

3.  **Create & activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # This will create a .venv directory using the Python version in .python-version
    uv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Sync with the locked dependencies for a consistent setup
    uv sync
    ```

## 👨‍💻 Usage

To run mobile-use, simply pass your command as an argument.

**Example 1: Basic Command**

```bash
python ./src/mobile_use/main.py "Go to settings and tell me my current battery level"
```

**Example 2: Data Scraping**

Extract specific information and get it back in a structured format. For instance, to get a list of your unread emails:

```bash
python ./src/mobile_use/main.py \
  "Open Gmail, find all unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't configured a specific model, mobile-use will prompt you to choose one from the available options.
