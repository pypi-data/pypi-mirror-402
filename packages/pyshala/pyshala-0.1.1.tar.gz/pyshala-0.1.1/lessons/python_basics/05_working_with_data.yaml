  # Working with Data Files

  Python is great for working with data! Let's learn to read CSV files using the `pandas` library.

  ## Reading a CSV File

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv("filename.csv")
  ```

  ## Basic DataFrame Operations

  ```python
  # See the first few rows
  print(df.head())

  # Get a single column
  ages = df["age"]

  # Calculate statistics
  total = df["amount"].sum()
  average = df["amount"].mean()
  ```

  ## Your Task

  You have access to a file called `sales.csv` with the following columns:
  - `product`: Product name
  - `quantity`: Number sold
  - `price`: Price per item

  Write a program that prints the **total quantity** of all products sold.

  **Hint:** Use `.sum()` on the quantity column!

starter_code: |
  import pandas as pd

  # Read the CSV file
  df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

  # Calculate and print the total quantity sold


data_files:
  - name: sales.csv
    path: sales_data.csv

test_cases:
  - description: "Calculates total quantity correctly"
    stdin: ""
    expected_output: "150"
