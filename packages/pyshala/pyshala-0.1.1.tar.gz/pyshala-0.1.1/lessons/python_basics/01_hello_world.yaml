  Welcome to Python! Let's write your first program.

  In Python, we use the `print()` function to display text on the screen.

  ## Example

  ```python
  print("Hello!")
  ```

  This will output: `Hello!`

  ## Your Task

  Write a program that prints exactly:
  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

  **Hint:** Make sure to include the comma and exclamation mark!
