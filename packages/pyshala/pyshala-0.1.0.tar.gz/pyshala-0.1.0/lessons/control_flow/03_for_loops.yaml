  # For Loops

  Use `for` loops to repeat code a specific number of times or iterate over items.

  ## Using range()

  The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers:

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```

  Output:
  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  ```

  **Note:** `range(5)` gives numbers 0 through 4 (not including 5).

  ## Range with Start and End

  ```python
  for i in range(1, 4):
      print(i)
  ```

  Output: 1, 2, 3

  ## Looping Over Lists

  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```

  ## Your Task

  Write a program that:
  1. Reads a number `n` from input
  2. Prints all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), each on a new line

  **Example:** If input is `3`, output should be:
  ```
  1
  2
  3
  ```

  n = int(input())

  # Print numbers from 1 to n

  - description: "Counts to 5"
    stdin: "5"
    expected_output: "1\n2\n3\n4\n5"

  - description: "Handles 1"
    stdin: "1"
    expected_output: "1"
