  # If Statements

  Use `if` statements to run code only when a condition is true.

  ## Basic Syntax

  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code runs if condition is True
      print("Condition was true!")
  ```

  **Important:** The code inside the `if` must be indented!

  ## Comparison Operators

  | Operator | Meaning |
  |----------|---------|
  | `==` | Equal to |
  | `!=` | Not equal to |
  | `>` | Greater than |
  | `<` | Less than |
  | `>=` | Greater than or equal |
  | `<=` | Less than or equal |

  ## Example

  ```python
  age = 18
  if age >= 18:
      print("You can vote!")
  ```

  ## Your Task

  Write a program that:
  1. Reads a number from input
  2. If the number is positive (greater than 0), prints `positive`

  **Note:** If the number is not positive, print nothing.

starter_code: |
  number = int(input())

  # Check if the number is positive
  # If so, print "positive"


test_cases:
  - description: "Identifies 5 as positive"
    stdin: "5"
    expected_output: "positive"

  - description: "Identifies 100 as positive"
    stdin: "100"
    expected_output: "positive"

  - description: "Prints nothing for 0"
    stdin: "0"
    expected_output: ""

  - description: "Prints nothing for negative"
    stdin: "-3"
    expected_output: ""
