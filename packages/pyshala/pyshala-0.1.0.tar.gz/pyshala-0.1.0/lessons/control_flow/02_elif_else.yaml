  # Elif and Else

  Handle multiple conditions using `elif` (else if) and `else`.

  ## Syntax

  ```python
  if condition1:
      print("First condition true")
  elif condition2:
      print("Second condition true")
  else:
      print("No conditions were true")
  ```

  ## How It Works

  1. Python checks conditions from top to bottom
  2. It runs the code for the **first** true condition
  3. If no conditions are true, the `else` block runs (if present)

  ## Example

  ```python
  score = 85

  if score >= 90:
      print("A")
  elif score >= 80:
      print("B")
  elif score >= 70:
      print("C")
  else:
      print("F")
  ```

  This prints `B` because 85 is >= 80.

  ## Your Task

  Write a program that reads a number and prints:
  - `positive` if the number is greater than 0
  - `zero` if the number is exactly 0
  - `negative` if the number is less than 0

  number = int(input())

  # Determine if the number is positive, zero, or negative
