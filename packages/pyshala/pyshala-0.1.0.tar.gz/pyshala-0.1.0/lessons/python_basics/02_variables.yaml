  # Variables

  Variables are containers for storing data. In Python, you create a variable by assigning a value to a name.

  ## Creating Variables

  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  age = 25
  price = 19.99
  ```

  ## Using Variables in print()

  You can print variables directly or combine them with text:

  ```python
  name = "Bob"
  print(name)           # Prints: Bob
  print("Hello,", name) # Prints: Hello, Bob
  ```

  ## Your Task

  Create two variables:
  1. `language` with the value `"Python"`
  2. `version` with the value `3`

  Then print them so the output is exactly:
  ```
  Python
  3
  ```

  # Create your variables below
  language =
  version =

  # Print them (one per line)
