## dc_curses.py, dc_defaults.py, dc_util.py, dircolors.py

## files.py

Miscellaneous file-related functions - backup creation, file-type detection, etc.

## git.py

A git library

## gitlab.py

GitLab access module - due to be deprecated as I no longer support GitLab

## path.py

Filesystem path-related functions

## popup.py

Popup window class for curses

## run.py

Wrapper around the subprocess module, providing additional functionality

## tfm_pane.py

Console-pane-handling code for TFM - will probably be moved into the TFM project when that is split out from skilleter-thingy
