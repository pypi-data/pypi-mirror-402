## MMDiT

Implementation of a single layer of the MMDiT, proposed by Esser et al. in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206">Stable Diffusion 3</a>, in Pytorch

Besides a straight reproduction, will also generalize to > 2 modalities, as I can envision an MMDiT for images, audio, and text.

Will also offer an <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/mmdit/blob/main/mmdit/adaptive_attention.py">improvised variant of self attention</a> that adaptively selects the weights to use through learned gating. This idea came from adaptive convolutions applied by Kang et al. for GigaGAN.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install mmdit
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from mmdit import MMDiTBlock

# define mm dit block

block = MMDiTBlock(
    dim_cond = 256,
    dim_text = 768,
    dim_image = 512,
    qk_rmsnorm = True
)

# mock inputs

time_cond = torch.randn(2, 256)

text_tokens = torch.randn(2, 512, 768)
text_mask = torch.ones((2, 512)).bool()

image_tokens = torch.randn(2, 1024, 512)

# single block forward

text_tokens_next, image_tokens_next = block(
    time_cond = time_cond,
    text_tokens = text_tokens,
    text_mask = text_mask,
    image_tokens = image_tokens
)
```

A generalized version can be used as so

```python
import torch
from mmdit.mmdit_generalized_pytorch import MMDiT

mmdit = MMDiT(
    depth = 2, 
    dim_modalities = (768, 512, 384),
    dim_cond = 256,
    qk_rmsnorm = True
)

# mock inputs

time_cond = torch.randn(2, 256)

text_tokens = torch.randn(2, 512, 768)
text_mask = torch.ones((2, 512)).bool()

video_tokens = torch.randn(2, 1024, 512)

audio_tokens = torch.randn(2, 256, 384)

# forward

text_tokens, video_tokens, audio_tokens = mmdit(
    modality_tokens = (text_tokens, video_tokens, audio_tokens),
    modality_masks = (text_mask, None, None),
    time_cond = time_cond,
)
```
