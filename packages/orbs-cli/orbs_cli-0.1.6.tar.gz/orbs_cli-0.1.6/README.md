  Automation framework that grows with your team
</p>

---

## What is Orbs?

**Orbs** is an automation framework for **Web, Mobile (Appium), and API testing** designed to **grow with your team**.

Orbs supports different levels of automation maturity:

* Junior QA engineers can start with visual tools, record-and-playback, reusable keywords, and Studio-based workflows
* Senior engineers can work directly with code, CLI, and CI/CD pipelines without restrictions or license lock-in

Both approaches share the same execution engine and project structure, allowing teams to evolve their automation practices **without rewriting tests or migrating frameworks**.

---

## Philosophy

### 1. Tests are software, not scripts

Automation code should be designed, structured, reviewed, and evolved like production code — not copied scripts glued together over time.

### 2. Explicit is better than implicit

If something runs, it should be obvious:

* what is executed
* from where
* with which configuration

No silent defaults. No hidden behavior.

### 3. Structure before scale

Orbs enforces structure early so teams don’t pay technical debt later. Scaling automation should feel predictable, not painful.

### 4. One core, many interfaces

The same execution engine can be accessed via:

* CLI
* REST API
* Orbs Studio (GUI)

Different entry points, same behavior.

### 5. Tooling should assist, not hide reality

Generators, runners, and spy tools exist to accelerate work — not to obscure how automation actually works.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install orbs-cli

orbs setup android
orbs init myproject
cd myproject

orbs create-feature login
orbs implement-feature login
orbs run features/login.feature
```

---

## CLI Overview

```bash
orbs setup android
orbs init <project>
orbs create-testsuite <name>
orbs create-testcase <name>
orbs create-feature <name>
orbs implement-feature <name>
orbs run <target>
orbs serve [--port <port>]
orbs spy
```

## Spy

Orbs provides an interactive **Web & Mobile Spy**, similar to Katalon's Object Spy, for inspecting elements and capturing locators.

```bash
orbs spy --web --url=https://example.com
orbs spy --mobile
```
