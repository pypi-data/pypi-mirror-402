  Construct the strongest possible version of an argument (steelmanning).

  The opposite of a strawman - instead of weakening an argument to attack it,
  this strengthens it to engage with it fairly. Returns the most charitable,
  well-reasoned, and defensible version of the position.

  Perfect for:
  - Intellectual honesty (engage with the best version)
  - Understanding opposition (why do smart people believe this?)
  - Debate prep (anticipate the strongest counter)
  - Policy analysis (what's the best case for this?)
  - Overcoming bias (truly consider the other side)

      Construct the STRONGEST possible version of this argument.

      Your task is to STEELMAN this position - present it in its most
      compelling, well-reasoned, and defensible form.

      Guidelines:

      1. **Assume Intelligence**: Imagine the smartest, most informed person
         making this argument. What would THEY say?

      2. **Add Supporting Evidence**: What facts, data, or examples
         strengthen this position?

      3. **Address Obvious Objections**: Preemptively handle the most
         common counterarguments.

      4. **Clarify Scope**: Define reasonable boundaries - the argument
         probably isn't meant to be absolute.

      5. **Ground in Values**: Connect to underlying principles that
         reasonable people share.

      6. **Remove Weak Elements**: Drop any parts that are indefensible
         or distract from the core point.

      7. **Improve Framing**: Present it in the most persuasive way
         without being manipulative.

      Example:

      Original: "Video games cause violence"

      Steelmanned: "There's reason for concern about the psychological effects
      of prolonged exposure to violent video games, particularly for developing
      minds. While correlation isn't causation, multiple studies show that
      violent game exposure can temporarily increase aggressive thoughts and
      decrease empathy. The concern isn't that games directly cause mass
      violence, but that they may be one factor among many that shapes attitudes
      toward conflict resolution, particularly when combined with other risk
      factors. Given the precautionary principle and the importance of child
      development, it's reasonable to advocate for age-appropriate restrictions,
      parental awareness tools, and further research - not because games are
      uniquely dangerous, but because we should be thoughtful about any media
      that depicts violence as entertaining and consequence-free."

      Return ONLY the steelmanned argument as plain text.
      Aim for 100-300 words depending on complexity.
      Do not include labels like "Steelmanned:" - just the argument itself.
      Do NOT wrap your response in JSON or any object structure.
      Do NOT use markdown code fences.
      Just output the argument text directly.
