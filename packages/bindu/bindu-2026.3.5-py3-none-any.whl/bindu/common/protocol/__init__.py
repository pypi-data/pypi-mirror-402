"""This is Bindu (pronounced "bind-u" - Sanskrit for "point" or "dot").

In the ancient Sanskrit tradition, a bindu represents the point of origin - the seed from which
everything emerges. Just as a single point connects to form constellations, Bindu connects
autonomous AI agents into a living, breathing swarm intelligence.

getbindu envisions a future where AI agents aren't trapped in silos, but dance together in
a decentralized choreography.

Each agent is a sovereign point of intelligence, self-hosted and
independent, yet capable of forming powerful connections with others. Through A2A (Agent to Agent), AP2, x402
these agents communicate, collaborate, and create emergent intelligence that transcends any
single entity.

This is cloud-native swarm intelligence - where every agent is both a participant and a host,
where trust is cryptographically verified, and where the network grows organically as more
points of light join the constellation.

Core protocol types are defined in types.py and should be imported directly from there.
