1,Mon/Tue,r/mcp,~1K,General MCP,"Built an open-source MCP gateway - looking for feedback","Gatekit sits between your client and servers.

[GitHub link]",Not Started,Smallest + most targeted
1,Thu/Fri,r/codex,~1K,OpenAI,"Anyone using MCP servers with Codex? Built a gateway for visibility","Wanted to see what tools were being called and filter out ones I didn't need.

2,Mon/Tue,r/ClaudeCode,~49K,Anthropic,"What's your MCP visibility story?","Running several MCP servers with Claude Code. Realized I had no idea what was actually being called or when.

2,Thu/Fri,r/LLMDevs,~125K,General,"Built an MCP gateway with a plugin system - curious what you'd extend","Gatekit intercepts traffic between MCP clients and servers. Built-in plugins for audit logging, tool filtering, PII detection. The interesting part is writing your own - ~50 lines of Python. What would you build? [GitHub link]",Not Started,Broader audience - plugin angle

3,Thu/Fri,r/cursor,~73K,Cursor IDE,"How are you managing MCP servers in Cursor?","Running a few MCP servers and wanted more visibility into what's happening.
