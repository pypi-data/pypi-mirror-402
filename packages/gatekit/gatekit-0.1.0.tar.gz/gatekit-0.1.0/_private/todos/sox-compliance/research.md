# SOX Compliance Research for Gatekit

## Executive Summary

This research examines how Gatekit can address SOX compliance requirements for MCP (Model Context Protocol) use cases in financial services. Gatekit acts as a security and compliance layer between AI assistants and critical financial systems, providing audit trails, access controls, and security filtering required by SOX regulations.

## SOX Compliance Overview

### Key SOX IT Control Requirements

**Section 302**: CEOs and CFOs must certify financial records accuracy and acknowledge responsibility for disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.

**Section 404**: Most complex and expensive requirement - publicly-traded companies must engage accounting firms to independently assess management's internal controls assessment.

### Critical IT General Controls (ITGC)

1. **Access Management**
   - Least-privilege access model (users only have access necessary for their job)
   - Regular access reviews and audits
   - Privileged access management
   - Multi-factor authentication for critical systems

2. **Audit Trail Requirements**
   - All changes affecting financial transactions must be audited
   - Detailed records of system interactions (who, what, when, why)
   - Comprehensive logging of data modifications (DML), structure changes (DDL), and permission changes (DCL)
   - Audit trails must be secured and available for review

3. **Change Management**
   - All changes must be authorized, tested, approved, and documented
   - Separation of duties to prevent fraudulent activities
   - Clear processes for system modifications

4. **Data Security & Confidentiality**
   - Encryption, access management, data loss prevention
   - Intrusion detection systems
   - Regular security testing and monitoring

### 2024 SOX Compliance Trends

- **Expanded Scope**: Majority of organizations report significantly expanded SOX compliance scope
- **Increased Costs**: Organizations spending over $1M annually on SOX compliance
- **AI Integration**: IT departments increasingly critical as companies adopt AI for financial analysis and reporting
- **Third-Party Focus**: Higher scrutiny on third-party service organization controls (SOC reports)
