# TUI Build Protection Requirements

## Overview

Determine and implement the appropriate level of code protection for the TUI components within the gatekit package to prevent easy source code access while maintaining functionality and reasonable build complexity.

## Context

The TUI will be distributed as closed-source freeware to protect the user experience innovations while keeping the core security functionality open source. We need to decide on the level of technical protection for the TUI source code.

## Decision Required

Choose the appropriate protection level for TUI source code distribution:

### Option 1: Standard Wheel Distribution (Minimal Protection)
**Implementation**: Build normal wheel, exclude source distribution
```bash
# Build with TUI source exclusion
python scripts/build-protected.py --protect-tui
```

**Protection Level**: 🔒 Low
- Standard .py files in wheel
- Easily readable by anyone who installs the package
- No reverse engineering required

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to implement and maintain
- ✅ No build complexity
- ✅ Compatible with all Python environments
- ✅ Easy debugging for us during development
- ✅ Standard Python packaging practices

**Cons**:
- ❌ Source code is completely visible
- ❌ Minimal deterrent against copying

### Option 2: Bytecode Compilation (Medium Protection)
**Implementation**: Compile to .pyc before building wheel
```python
import py_compile
py_compile.compile('source.py', 'compiled.pyc')
# Build wheel with .pyc files instead of .py files
```

**Protection Level**: 🔒🔒 Medium
- Source compiled to Python bytecode
- Requires decompilation tools to read
- Not immediately human-readable

**Pros**:
- ✅ Moderate deterrent against casual inspection
- ✅ Still relatively simple to implement
- ✅ Works across Python versions
- ✅ Faster import times (minor benefit)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Easily decompiled with tools like `uncompyle6`
- ❌ Debugging becomes more difficult
- ❌ Slightly more complex build process

### Option 3: Cython Compilation (Higher Protection)
**Implementation**: Compile Python to C extensions using Cython
```python
# Convert .py files to .pyx, then compile to .so/.pyd
from setuptools import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
setup(ext_modules = cythonize("gatekit_tui/*.py"))
```

**Protection Level**: 🔒🔒🔒 High
- Source compiled to native binary extensions
- Significantly harder to reverse engineer
- Near-impossible to recover original source

**Pros**:
- ✅ Strong protection against reverse engineering
- ✅ Potentially faster execution
- ✅ Professional appearance

**Cons**:
- ❌ Complex build process requiring C compiler
- ❌ Platform-specific wheels (Windows, macOS, Linux separately)
- ❌ Debugging becomes very difficult
- ❌ Larger build infrastructure requirements
- ❌ Potential compatibility issues

### Option 4: Code Obfuscation + Bytecode (Very High Protection)
**Implementation**: Obfuscate source code then compile to bytecode
```python
# Use tools like pyobfuscate or similar to scramble code
# Then compile to bytecode
```

**Protection Level**: 🔒🔒🔒🔒 Very High
- Code structure obscured before compilation
- Variable/function names randomized
- Control flow obfuscated

**Pros**:
- ✅ Extremely difficult to understand even when decompiled
- ✅ Professional commercial software level protection

**Cons**:
- ❌ Very complex build process
- ❌ Potential runtime performance impact
- ❌ Debugging becomes nearly impossible
- ❌ Risk of introducing bugs during obfuscation
- ❌ Expensive obfuscation tools may be required

## Recommendation Analysis

### Business Context
- **Goal**: Prevent wholesale copying and rebranding of TUI
- **Audience**: Technical users who could reverse engineer if motivated
- **Legal Protection**: We have copyright and licensing as primary protection
- **Development Stage**: Pre-release, will need debugging capabilities

### Technical Reality
- **Python bytecode is easily decompiled**: Tools like `uncompyle6` can recover nearly original source
- **True protection requires significant effort**: Only Cython or obfuscation provide meaningful barriers
- **Diminishing returns**: Each level increases complexity exponentially for modest protection gains

### Recommended Approach: Start Simple, Upgrade If Needed

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Standard Wheel Distribution (Option 1)
- Implement wheel-only distribution immediately
- Focus on legal protection and professional presentation
- Monitor for actual copying attempts

**Phase 2 (If Needed)**: Bytecode Compilation (Option 2)
- Upgrade to bytecode if we see evidence of source code inspection
- Provides moderate deterrent with reasonable complexity

**Phase 3 (If Required)**: Evaluate Cython (Option 3)
- Only if significant competitive pressure emerges
- Requires major build infrastructure investment

## Implementation Requirements

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. **Update build scripts** to create wheel-only for TUI:
   ```bash
   # TUI compilation within main package structure
   python scripts/compile-tui.py
   python -m build --wheel  # Exclude source distribution
   ```

2. **Add clear licensing** in wheel metadata and startup:
   ```python
   # In TUI startup
   print("Gatekit TUI - Proprietary Freeware")
   print("Copyright (c) 2025. Not for redistribution.")
   ```

3. **Document legal protection** in LICENSE.PROPRIETARY:
   ```
   This software is free to use but NOT free for:
   - Redistribution as part of commercial products
   - Rebranding or white-labeling
   - Inclusion in competitive products
   ```

### Future Phases (If Needed)

**Bytecode Compilation Script**:
```python
# scripts/compile-tui-bytecode.py
import py_compile
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

def compile_directory(source_dir, target_dir):
    for py_file in source_dir.rglob("*.py"):
        rel_path = py_file.relative_to(source_dir)
        target_file = target_dir / rel_path.with_suffix('.pyc')
        target_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        py_compile.compile(py_file, target_file)
```

**Cython Setup** (if ever needed):
```python
# setup.py for Cython compilation
from setuptools import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize(
        "gatekit_tui/*.py",
        compiler_directives={'language_level': 3}
    )
)
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 (Standard Wheel)**:
- [ ] TUI package builds as wheel-only (no .tar.gz source)
- [ ] Source code not visible in site-packages after pip install
- [ ] Clear licensing messages displayed
- [ ] Legal terms easily discoverable
- [ ] Build process remains simple and reliable

**Future Phases**:
- [ ] Source code requires tools/effort to access
- [ ] Build process remains maintainable
- [ ] Debugging still possible for development team
- [ ] No functionality regressions

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Threat Model**: Who specifically are we protecting against?
   - Casual users browsing site-packages?
   - Competitors attempting to copy features?
   - Security researchers examining code?

2. **Business Priority**: How important is technical protection vs. legal protection?
   - Are we primarily concerned with legal compliance?
   - Do we expect determined reverse engineering attempts?

3. **Development Impact**: How much build complexity can we accept?
   - Are we willing to sacrifice easy debugging?
   - Do we have resources for platform-specific builds?

4. **Timeline**: When do we need this implemented?
   - Can we defer to post-launch if needed?
   - Is this blocking other development priorities?

## Decision Timeline

- **Immediate**: Implement Option 1 (Standard Wheel) for current development
- **Month 1**: Evaluate need for upgraded protection based on competitive landscape
- **Month 3**: Review protection effectiveness and consider Option 2 if needed
- **Month 6**: Assess for Option 3 only if significant business justification exists

## Dependencies

- None for Option 1
- C compiler infrastructure for Option 3
- Platform-specific build runners for Option 3
- Obfuscation tools for Option 4
