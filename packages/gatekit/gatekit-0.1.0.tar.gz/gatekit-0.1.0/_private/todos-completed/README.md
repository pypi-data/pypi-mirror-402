# Completed Todos Archive

This directory contains work items that have been fully implemented in Gatekit. These are preserved for historical reference and to document the project's evolution.

## Implementation Status

All items in this directory represent fully implemented and tested features that were part of the Gatekit codebase at the time they were completed. They included comprehensive test coverage and documentation. All documents in this archive, however, may very well represent old architecture and capabilities so **should not be consulted as part of requirements gathering or implementation work**.

## Reference Use

These archives serve as:
- Historical record of project development
- Reference for similar future implementations  
- Documentation of design decisions and rationale
- Examples of Gatekit's implementation patterns
