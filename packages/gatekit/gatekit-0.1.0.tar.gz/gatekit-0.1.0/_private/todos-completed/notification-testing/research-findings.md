# Notification Testing Research Findings

## Overview

This document summarizes research into testing Gatekit's notification support, including findings on existing MCP servers that send notifications and recommendations for implementing comprehensive notification tests.

## Current Implementation Status

Gatekit has notification support implemented in the following components:

1. **MCPProxy** (`gatekit/proxy/server.py`):
   - `handle_notification()` - Processes notifications from clients
   - `_listen_for_upstream_notifications()` - Background task to receive notifications from upstream servers
   
2. **StdioTransport** (`gatekit/transport/stdio.py`):
   - `send_notification()` - Sends notifications
   - `get_next_notification()` - Retrieves notifications from queue
   - Message dispatcher that routes notifications separately from responses

3. **Plugin System**:
   - `process_notification()` - Security plugins can inspect/modify notifications
   - `log_notification()` - Auditing plugins can log notifications

## Research Findings

### MCP Servers That Send Notifications

After researching the MCP ecosystem, we found:

1. **Limited Real-World Examples**: Most current MCP servers focus on request/response patterns
2. **Specification Support**: The MCP specification fully supports bidirectional notifications
3. **Common Notification Use Cases**:
   - Progress updates for long-running operations
   - State change notifications
   - Error/warning notifications that don't halt operations
   - Resource availability changes

### Testing Challenges

1. **No Standard Test Server**: No widely-used MCP server currently sends notifications for testing
2. **Bidirectional Nature**: Notifications can flow both directions (client→server, server→client)
3. **Async Behavior**: Notifications are asynchronous and can arrive at any time
4. **No Response Required**: Unlike requests, notifications don't have responses to verify

## Recommended Testing Approach

### 1. Create Mock MCP Server for Notifications

Build a simple mock MCP server that can:
- Accept connections via stdio
- Send notifications at configurable intervals
- Send different notification types
- Handle both directions (receive client notifications, send server notifications)

Example implementation:
```python
# tests/mocks/notification_server.py
class NotificationMockServer:
    """Mock MCP server that sends notifications for testing."""
    
    async def send_periodic_notifications(self):
        """Send notifications at intervals."""
        while self.running:
            notification = {
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "method": "progress/update",
                "params": {
                    "progress": self.progress,
                    "message": f"Processing... {self.progress}%"
                }
            }
            await self.send_notification(notification)
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

### 2. Test Scenarios

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/test_notification_handling.py`)

1. **Basic Notification Processing**:
   - Test `handle_notification()` with various notification types
   - Verify plugin processing for notifications
   - Test notification forwarding logic

2. **Notification Validation**:
   - Valid notification format
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid method names

3. **Plugin Interaction**:
   - Security plugins can modify notifications
   - Auditing plugins log notifications
   - Plugin errors don't break notification flow

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_notification_flow.py`)

1. **Client to Server Notifications**:
   - Client sends notification
   - Proxy processes through plugins
   - Upstream server receives notification

2. **Server to Client Notifications**:
   - Upstream server sends notification
   - Proxy processes through plugins
   - Client receives notification

3. **Bidirectional Flow**:
   - Simultaneous notifications in both directions
   - Proper routing and isolation

4. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Upstream server disconnection during notification
   - Malformed notifications
   - Plugin failures during notification processing

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure
1. Create `NotificationMockServer` class
2. Create `NotificationTestClient` class
3. Add notification generation utilities

#### Phase 2: Unit Tests
1. Test notification validation
2. Test plugin processing
3. Test error handling

#### Phase 3: Integration Tests
1. Test end-to-end notification flow
2. Test bidirectional notifications
3. Test error scenarios

#### Phase 4: Performance Tests
1. Test high-volume notifications
2. Test notification ordering
3. Test resource usage

## Success Criteria

1. **Coverage**: All notification code paths have test coverage
2. **Reliability**: Tests are deterministic and don't have timing issues
3. **Comprehensiveness**: Tests cover normal flow, edge cases, and error scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Clear examples of how to test with notifications

## Next Steps

1. Implement the mock notification server
2. Create unit tests for notification handling
3. Create integration tests for end-to-end flow
4. Document notification testing patterns for future contributors
