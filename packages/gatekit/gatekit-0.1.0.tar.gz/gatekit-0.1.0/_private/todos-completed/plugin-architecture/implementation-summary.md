# Plugin Architecture Implementation Summary

**Feature**: Plugin Architecture Foundation  
**Developer**: Gatekit Team

## What Was Built

Implemented a comprehensive plugin system that serves as the foundation for all Gatekit extensibility. The architecture supports two plugin types (Security and Auditing) with clear interfaces, configuration management, and error isolation.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Abstract Base Classes for Plugin Contracts
**Decision**: Use ABC (Abstract Base Classes) to define plugin interfaces  
**Rationale**: 
- Enforces consistent plugin implementation
- Clear contract for plugin developers
- Type safety and IDE support
- Runtime validation of plugin completeness

### 2. PolicyDecision Communication Pattern
**Decision**: Plugins communicate through PolicyDecision objects rather than direct interaction  
**Rationale**:
- Decouples plugins from each other
- Provides structured audit trail
- Enables plugin chaining without tight coupling
- Clear data flow for debugging

### 3. Priority-Based Execution Order
**Decision**: Plugins execute in configurable priority order  
**Rationale**:
- Predictable behavior
- Allows ordering security checks appropriately
- Supports dependency-like relationships
- Easy to debug execution flow

### 4. Error Isolation Strategy
**Decision**: Plugin failures are contained and don't crash the proxy  
**Rationale**:
- System remains operational even with plugin bugs
- Individual plugin issues don't affect others
- Provides clear error reporting per plugin
- Enables graceful degradation

## Implementation Patterns Established

- **Plugin Discovery**: Configuration-based loading from specified modules
- **Configuration Schema**: Pydantic models for type-safe plugin config
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch around each plugin with logging
- **Testing Pattern**: Mock-based unit tests + integration tests

## Lessons for Future Features

1. **Configuration-driven is better than auto-discovery** - Explicit plugin loading prevents surprises
2. **Error isolation is critical** - Plugin failures should never crash core functionality
3. **Clear interfaces reduce complexity** - ABC enforcement catches implementation errors early
4. **PolicyDecision pattern works well** - Provides audit trail without tight coupling
