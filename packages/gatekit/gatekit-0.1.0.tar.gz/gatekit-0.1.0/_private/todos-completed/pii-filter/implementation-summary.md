# PII Filter Implementation Summary

**Feature**: PII Content Filter Plugin  
**Developer**: Gatekit Team

## What Was Built

Implemented a comprehensive PII detection and filtering plugin for Gatekit that identifies and handles personally identifiable information in MCP communications. The plugin supports detection of:

- Social Security Numbers (US format)
- Credit card numbers (all major formats with Luhn validation)
- Email addresses (RFC 5322 compliant)
- Phone numbers (US, UK, EU, and international formats)
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Custom organization-specific patterns

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Regex-Based Detection
**Decision**: Use regex patterns instead of ML-based detection  
**Rationale**: 
- Predictable, testable behavior
- No external dependencies
- Sub-50ms performance requirement
- Lower false positive rate for production use

### 2. Modular PII Type System
**Decision**: Each PII type independently configurable  
**Rationale**:
- Organizations have different compliance needs
- Reduces false positives by disabling unnecessary detectors
- Easier to test and maintain

### 3. Three Action Modes
**Decision**: Support block, redact, and audit_only modes  
**Rationale**:
- Progressive deployment strategy
- Audit_only for initial rollout
- Redact for logging while protecting data
- Block for strict compliance environments

## Significant Challenges/Learnings

### False Positive Management
- Initial patterns too aggressive (blocked timestamps, IDs)
- Solution: Refined patterns with better anchoring
- Added exemption system for known-safe contexts

### International Format Support
- Original US-centric patterns insufficient
- Expanded to support UK, EU formats
- Made format selection configurable per PII type

### Performance Optimization
- Initial implementation: 100-200ms per request
- After optimization: 10-30ms
- Key: Pre-compile patterns, optimize regex order

## Implementation Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~650 (including tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 98%
- **Number of Tests**: 47
- **Performance**: 10-30ms average per request
- **False Positive Rate**: <0.1% (based on test corpus)

## Integration Points

- Integrates with `SecurityPlugin` base class
- Uses `PolicyDecision` for audit trail
- Configuration via standard plugin YAML
- Works with other security plugins in pipeline

## Deployment Considerations

1. Start with `audit_only` mode
2. Review logs for false positives
3. Add exemptions as needed
4. Switch to `redact` or `block` mode
5. Monitor performance metrics

## Lessons for Future Plugins

1. **Start with conservative patterns** - Can always make more aggressive
2. **Build comprehensive test suite early** - Real-world data essential
3. **Design for configurability** - One size doesn't fit all
4. **Consider international users** - Don't assume US-centric data
5. **Measure performance continuously** - Easy to introduce slowdowns

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add confidence scoring to detections
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated content
- [ ] Add webhook notifications for blocked content
- [ ] Create PII detection dashboard
- [ ] Explore ML-based enhancement for v2
