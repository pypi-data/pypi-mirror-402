# Gatekit Financial Services Positioning Strategy

*Research conducted following Anthropic's Claude for Financial Services announcement*

## Executive Summary

Gatekit should position as an **AI Compliance and Auditing Platform** targeting mid-market financial services firms.

**Target Revenue**: $250k ARR within 2-3 years  
**Primary Market**: Mid-market wealth management, regional banks, and financial planning firms  
**Core Value Proposition**: Independent AI governance across all vendors with comprehensive compliance reporting

## Target Market Strategy

### Primary Target: Mid-Market Financial Services

**Tier 1 (Primary): Wealth Management & Financial Planning**
- 500+ employee Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs)
- Financial planning firms adopting AI for client communications
- Wealth management companies using AI for research and portfolio analysis
- **Budget Authority**: Compliance officers with dedicated regulatory budgets
- **Decision Timeline**: 3-6 months vs. 12-24 months for enterprise

**Tier 2 (Secondary): Regional Financial Institutions**
- Regional banks ($1B-$10B assets)
- Credit unions adopting AI
- Smaller insurance companies
- **Characteristics**: Regulated but more agile than major banks

**Tier 3 (Future): Fintech & Financial Technology**

### Why Mid-Market vs. Enterprise

**Accessibility**:
- Shorter sales cycles (3-6 months vs. 12-24 months)

**Market Gap**:
- Underserved by enterprise solutions (too expensive)

## Positioning Decision: Compliance & Auditing Platform

### Why Compliance Over Security

**Regulatory Requirements Are Mandatory**:
- Security is "should do" - compliance is "must do"
- Compliance violations result in measurable fines
- Regulatory budgets are protected, security budgets are discretionary

**Budget Authority & Decision Making**:
- Compliance positioning: Chief Risk Officer/Compliance Officer decides
- Security positioning: CISO/IT leadership (often cost center)
- Compliance budgets are mandatory line items
- Clear ROI: cost of solution vs. cost of regulatory violations

**Market Opportunity**:
- Security AI market: Crowded with established players
- AI Compliance market: Emerging category with few solutions
- Gatekit's differentiation: Only independent AI governance for financial services

**Alignment with Transcript**:
- Panelists emphasized "regulatory challenges" and "compliance requirements"
- Focus on "audit teams" and "model risk teams"
- Discussion of "innovation and risk management" balance

### Core Messaging Framework

**Primary Value Proposition**:
"The independent AI compliance platform that lets financial services firms safely adopt AI while meeting all regulatory requirements."
