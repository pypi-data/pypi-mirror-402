# Optimizing Tool Context for Better Agent Performance

*[Home](../../../README.md) → [User Documentation](../../README.md) → [Tutorials](../README.md) → Optimizing Tool Context*

This tutorial will teach you how to optimize your agent's tool context using Gatekit, improving reasoning quality and reducing token usage by carefully managing which tools your agent sees.

## What You'll Accomplish

The `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` is one of the most popular MCP servers, but it provides many tools that your agent might not need for specific tasks. Too many tools in context can:
- Consume valuable tokens that could be used for reasoning
- Confuse the LLM with irrelevant options
- Slow down decision-making

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Gatekit's tool context management to optimize your agent's capabilities. By the end, you'll have:

- **Optimized tool context**: Show only the tools needed for the task, improving agent focus
- **Better reasoning**: Reduced cognitive load leads to better agent decisions
- **Token efficiency**: Save context window space for actual work
- **Security as a bonus**: Limiting tools also improves security by reducing attack surface

This approach helps you build more effective agents while maintaining security-first principles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Claude Desktop** installed on your system
- **Python** (version 3.11 or higher) for Gatekit
- **Node.js and npm** for running the MCP filesystem server
- **uv** tool for Gatekit installation

### Verify Your Prerequisites

Before proceeding, verify your system meets all requirements:

```bash
# Verify Python version (should be 3.11 or higher)
# On macOS/Linux:
python3 --version
# On Windows:
python --version

# Verify Node.js and npm are available (required for npx)
node --version
npm --version

# Verify uv tool is available
uv --version
```

**If Node.js is missing**: Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) to install Node.js, which includes npm and npx.

If any of these commands fail, install the missing tools before continuing.

## Verify Gatekit Installation

If you haven't already installed Gatekit, install it using your preferred Python package manager:

```bash
uv add gatekit
# or: pip install gatekit
```

To verify Gatekit is properly installed:

```bash
gatekit --help
```

## Filesystem MCP Server

The filesystem MCP server allows Claude to read and write files in specified directories. No installation is needed - Gatekit will automatically run it using `npx` when you start the proxy.

## Configure Gatekit for Tool Access Control

We'll use the provided configuration file that includes tool access control settings.

1. **Understanding the configuration**:

   The tutorial uses the configuration file at `configs/tutorials/1-securing-tool-access.yaml`, which contains:

   ```yaml
   # Gatekit Configuration for Tool Access Control
   proxy:
     # How Gatekit communicates with the MCP server (stdio = command-line interface)
     transport: stdio
     upstream:
       # This starts the filesystem MCP server using npx (Node.js package runner)
       # @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem is the official filesystem server
       # ~/claude-sandbox/ is the directory the filesystem server will operate within
       command: "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~/claude-sandbox/"

   plugins:
     security:
       # Enable the tool access control plugin
       - policy: "tool_allowlist"
         enabled: true
         config:
           # "allowlist" mode: only specified tools are permitted (most secure)
           # Other options: "blocklist" (block specific tools), "allow_all" (no restrictions)
           mode: "allowlist"
           tools:
             # List of filesystem operations that Claude is allowed to use
             # These are the only tools Claude will see and can execute
             - "read_file"        # Read file contents
             - "write_file"       # Create or modify files
             - "create_directory" # Create new directories
             - "list_directory"   # List directory contents
             - "move_file"        # Rename or move files
             - "search_files"     # Search for files by name/pattern
           # Message shown when a blocked tool is attempted
           block_message: "Tool access denied by security policy"
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Transport**: Uses `stdio` to communicate with command-line MCP servers
   - **Upstream Command**: Starts the filesystem server with `~/claude-sandbox/` as its working directory
   - **Security Mode**: `allowlist` only permits the specified tools
   - **Tool List**: Only essential filesystem operations are allowed

2. **Create a safe sandbox directory**:
   
   ```bash
   # Create a directory for Claude to work in (using home directory for predictable paths)
   mkdir ~/claude-sandbox
   
   # Add some sample files for testing
   echo "Hello from the sandbox!" > ~/claude-sandbox/readme.txt
   mkdir ~/claude-sandbox/projects
   ```

   **Note**: We use `~/claude-sandbox/` (in your home directory) to ensure a predictable absolute path regardless of where Claude Desktop starts. If you prefer a different location, simply update the `command:` line in the configuration file to point to your chosen directory.

## Configure Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use Gatekit as a proxy to the filesystem MCP server.

1. **Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:**
   
   The configuration file should already exist if you've used Claude Desktop before:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   
   **If the file doesn't exist:** Reinstall Claude Desktop from the official website to ensure proper setup.

2. **Create or update the configuration file:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem-via-gatekit": {
      "command": "<gatekit_root>/gatekit",
      "args": [
        "--config", "<gatekit_root>/configs/tutorials/1-securing-tool-access.yaml"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `<gatekit_root>` with the absolute path to your Gatekit installation directory. For example:
- **macOS/Linux**: `/Users/yourusername/gatekit` or `/home/yourusername/gatekit`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\yourusername\gatekit`

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** after making configuration changes:
   
   Close Claude Desktop completely and restart it. Configuration changes only take effect after a restart.

## Test Your Tool Access Control Setup

Now let's test that everything is working correctly.

1. **Test the setup with Claude Desktop**:
   
   - Launch Claude Desktop and start a new conversation
   - Test with: "Can you list the files in my directory?"
   - Test with: "Please create a test file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello from Claude!'"
   - Verify tool access control by asking Claude what tools are available

   **What happens behind the scenes**: When you start a conversation, Claude Desktop automatically launches Gatekit with your configuration. Gatekit will show output similar to this in its logs:
   
   ```
   [INFO] gatekit.main: Loading configuration from gatekit-config.yaml
   [INFO] gatekit.main: Starting Gatekit MCP Gateway
   [INFO] gatekit.plugins.manager: Loaded security plugin: tool_allowlist
   [INFO] gatekit.proxy.server: Connected to upstream server
   [INFO] gatekit.proxy.server: MCPProxy now accepting client connections
   ```

## Tool Access Control Configuration Options

The `tool_allowlist` plugin supports several configuration modes:

### Allowlist Mode (Most Restrictive)
```yaml
config:
  mode: "allowlist"
  tools:
    - "read_file"
    - "write_file"
    - "list_directory"
  # Only specified tools are allowed
```

### Blocklist Mode (Less Restrictive)
```yaml
config:
  mode: "blocklist"
  tools:
    - "delete_file"
    - "execute_command"
    - "system_call"
  # All tools allowed except specified ones
```

### Allow All Mode (No Restrictions)
```yaml
config:
  mode: "allow_all"
  # All tools are permitted (useful for development)
```

### How Tool Access Control Works

The tool access control plugin provides dual protection:

1. **Tool Execution Filtering**: Blocks `tools/call` requests for disallowed tools
2. **Tool Discovery Filtering**: Filters `tools/list` responses so Claude only sees allowed tools

This means if a tool isn't in your allowlist, Claude won't even know it exists!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Gatekit command not found"**
   - Ensure Gatekit is properly installed: `uv add gatekit` (or `pip install gatekit`)
   - Verify installation: `gatekit --help`
   - Check your PATH includes the Python scripts directory

2. **"Command 'uv' not found"**
   - Install the uv tool: Visit [uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for platform-specific instructions
   - Alternative: Use pip instead: `pip install gatekit`

3. **"Command 'npx' not found"**
   - Install Node.js which includes npx: Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions
   - Verify installation: `npx --version`

4. **"Claude Desktop not connecting"**
   - Verify the configuration file path and JSON syntax
   - Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
   - Check that Gatekit is running with: `gatekit --config gatekit-config.yaml --verbose`

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Gatekit status:**
   ```bash
   gatekit --config gatekit-config.yaml --verbose
   ```

2. **Verify filesystem server directly:**
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ./claude-sandbox/
   ```

3. **Test configuration loading:**
   ```bash
   gatekit debug plugins --validate-priorities --config gatekit-config.yaml
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working setup, you can explore these additional capabilities:

### Audit Logging

Add comprehensive audit logging to monitor all tool usage:

- **Complete MCP Communication Logs**: Track every request and response
- **Security Event Monitoring**: Log blocked tools and policy violations
- **Multiple Log Formats**: Simple text, JSON, or detailed formats

See the [Implementing Audit Logging](implementing-audit-logging.md) tutorial for detailed instructions.

### Resource-Level Security

Now that you have tool-level security working, consider adding resource-level access control:

- **Content Access Control Plugin**: Control which files and directories can be accessed
- **Pattern-Based Control**: Use gitignore-style patterns for fine-grained access control
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine tool access control with content access control for comprehensive security

See the [Protecting Sensitive Content](protecting-sensitive-content.md) tutorial for detailed instructions.

### Advanced Configuration:

1. **Explore other MCP servers** like web search, database connections, or API integrations
2. **Add custom plugins** for specialized security or auditing needs  
3. **Set up multiple Gatekit instances** for different use cases
4. **Environment-specific configurations** for development vs production

For more advanced configuration options and plugin development, see the [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration-reference.md).
