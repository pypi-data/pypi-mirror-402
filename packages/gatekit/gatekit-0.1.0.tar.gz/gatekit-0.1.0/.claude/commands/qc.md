# QC Feedback Review

Another model has reviewed the recent work and provided feedback. Your task is to critically evaluate this feedback.

## Instructions

1. **Evaluate each point** - Don't blindly accept the feedback
2. **State agreement or disagreement** - Be explicit about your position on each item
3. **Explain your reasoning** - Provide clear justification for why you agree or disagree
4. **Challenge incorrect feedback** - If QC is wrong, say so and explain why
5. **Acknowledge valid points** - If QC caught something you missed, acknowledge it

Remember: QC feedback is not automatically correct. Apply your own judgment and expertise.
