# Note: The secrets filter with entropy_detection.enabled: true should
# detect high-entropy strings even if they don't match known patterns.
# The entropy_detection.threshold setting controls sensitivity:
# - threshold: 3.5 = catches more (including medium entropy)
# - threshold: 4.5 = default, balanced
# - threshold: 5.0 = only very high entropy (fewer false positives)
