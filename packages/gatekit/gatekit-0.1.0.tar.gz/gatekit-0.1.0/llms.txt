# Gatekit

> Gatekit is a hackable MCP gateway. Built-in plugins handle tool filtering, audit logging, and content security. Extend with Python plugins when needed.

Gatekit sits between MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) and upstream MCP servers, applying security policies, middleware transformations, and audit logging to all traffic.
