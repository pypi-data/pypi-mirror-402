# Contributing

Gatekit is not currently accepting code contributions.

We welcome:
- Bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gatekit-ai/gatekit/issues)
- Feature requests via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gatekit-ai/gatekit/issues)
- Questions and discussions

## Why?

Gatekit is a new project and we're focused on stabilizing the core before opening to external contributions. Reviewing and maintaining third-party code requires significant effort, and we want to ensure we can do it properly when the time comes.

## Future

We plan to open contributions in the future with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you're interested in contributing, watch the repo for updates.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Gatekit version (`gatekit --version`)
- Python version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant configuration (redact sensitive values)
