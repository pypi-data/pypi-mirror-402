"""
Base classes and core components for modeling neurons and ion channels in the BrainCell library.

This module defines the fundamental classes and structures for creating Hodgkin-Huxley type
neuron models and various ion channels. It provides a hierarchical structure that allows
for the creation of complex, biologically accurate neural simulations.

Class Hierarchy:
----------------

1. HHTypedNeuron
   Base class for Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models.
   - SingleCompartment (not defined in this file)
     A subclass representing a single-compartment neuron model.

2. IonChannel
   Base class for all ion channel types.

   - Ion
     Base class for specific ion channels.
     - Calcium
       Represents calcium ion channels.
     - Potassium
       Represents potassium ion channels.
     - Sodium
       Represents sodium ion channels.

   - MixIons
     Represents channels that involve multiple ion types.

   - Channel
     A generic channel class, possibly for custom or complex channel types.

Key Components:
---------------
- HHTypedNeuron: The foundation for creating Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models.
  It manages ion channels and provides methods for current calculation and state updates.

- IonChannel: The base class for all ion channel types, defining the interface
  for channel behavior including current calculation and state management.

- Ion: Specializes IonChannel for specific ion types (Calcium, Potassium, Sodium).
  Each subclass represents the dynamics of its respective ion.

- MixIons: Allows for the creation of channels that involve multiple ion types,
  useful for modeling more complex channel behaviors.

- Channel: A generic channel class that can be used for custom channel types or
  as a base for more specific channel implementations.

This structure allows for a flexible and extensible framework for modeling various
types of neurons and ion channels, from simple single-compartment models to more
complex multi-compartment or custom channel configurations.

Usage:
------
Users can subclass these base classes to create specific neuron models or ion channel
types, leveraging the provided structure and methods to implement detailed, biologically
accurate simulations.

Note:
-----
The actual implementations of some classes (e.g., SingleCompartment, specific Ion subclasses)
may be defined in other files within the BrainCell library.

class IonChannel(brainstate.graph.Node, TreeNode, DiffEqModule):
    """
    Base class for modeling ion channel dynamics in neuronal simulations.

    The IonChannel class serves as a foundation for implementing various types of ion channels,
    including those for specific ions (e.g., sodium, potassium) or mixtures of ions. It provides
    a structure for defining the behavior and properties of ion channels within a neuron model.

    This class is designed to be subclassed to create specific ion channel models. Subclasses
    should implement the core methods to define the channel's behavior, such as current calculation,
    state initialization, and derivative computation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    in_size : tuple
        The dimensions of the ion channel, representing its size (e.g., number of neurons,
        number of compartments).
    out_size : tuple
        Same as in_size, representing the output dimensions of the channel.
    name : str, optional
        A name identifier for the ion channel.

    Notes
    -----
    - Subclasses should override the abstract methods (current, compute_derivative, init_state,
      reset_state) to define the specific behavior of the ion channel.
    - The class integrates with the broader neuron modeling framework, allowing for complex
      simulations of neuronal dynamics.
    - It's designed to work within a hierarchical structure of neuronal components, as indicated
      by its inheritance from TreeNode.

    A named tuple representing the information of an ion in a neuron model.

    This class encapsulates two key properties of an ion: its concentration
    and its reversal potential. It is used to store and pass ion-related
    information in various neuronal simulation contexts.

    Attributes:
        C (brainstate.typing.ArrayLike): The ion concentration.
            This represents the concentration of the ion, typically
            in units of millimoles per liter (mM).

        E (brainstate.typing.ArrayLike): The reversal potential.
            This represents the electrical potential at which there is no net
            flow of the ion across the membrane, typically in millivolts (mV).

    Note:
        Both C and E are expected to be array-like objects, allowing for
        representation of these properties across multiple neurons or
        compartments simultaneously.

class Ion(IonChannel, Container):
    """
    The base class for modeling ion dynamics in neuronal simulations.

    This class represents a specific type of ion (e.g., sodium, potassium) and manages
    the associated ion channels and their dynamics. It inherits from both IonChannel
    and Container, allowing it to handle ion-specific behaviors and contain multiple
    channel instances.

    Args:
        size (brainstate.typing.Size): The size of the simulation target, typically
            representing the number of neurons or compartments.
        name (Optional[str]): The name of the Ion instance. Defaults to None.
        **channels: Additional keyword arguments for specifying Channel instances
            to be included in this Ion object.

    Attributes:
        channels (Dict[str, Channel]): A dictionary of Channel instances associated
            with this ion.

    The Ion class serves as a crucial component in modeling the behavior of specific
    ion types within a neuron or neural network simulation. It manages the collective
    behavior of multiple ion channels of the same ion type and provides methods for
    initializing, updating, and querying the state of these channels throughout the
    simulation process.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    size : brainstate.typing.Size
        The size of the ion channel, typically representing the number of
        neurons or compartments.
    name : Optional[str], default=None
        The name of the Ion instance. If not provided, the instance will be unnamed.
    **channels
        Additional keyword arguments for specifying Channel instances to be
        included in this Ion object.

        Reset the state of all channels in the mixed ion group.

        This method iterates through all Channel nodes in the MixIons instance and resets
        their states to initial values. It's typically used when restarting a simulation
        or when transitioning between different phases of a simulation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        V : array-like
            The current membrane potential for all neurons in the simulation.
            This is used to reset the channel states based on the current voltage.

        batch_size : int, optional
            The batch size for the simulation. If provided, it will be used to reset
            the states with the specified batch size, ensuring consistency in batched simulations.

        Notes
        -----
        The method retrieves all Channel nodes, packs the necessary ion information
        for each channel, and then calls the reset_state method of each channel
        with the current membrane potential, ion information, and batch size.
