    # Runs 'at 00:00 on every day' UTC time.
    # You can adjust the time. Use cron syntax (minute hour day month day-of-week).
    # See: https://crontab.guru for help with cron syntax.
    # Example: '0 3 * * *' runs at 3:00 AM UTC daily.
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

  # OPTIONAL: Add other triggers if you want tests to run more often
  # For example, run on pushes and pull requests to the main branch:
  # push:
  #   branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
     branches: [ main ]

  # OPTIONAL: Allow manual triggering from the Actions tab
