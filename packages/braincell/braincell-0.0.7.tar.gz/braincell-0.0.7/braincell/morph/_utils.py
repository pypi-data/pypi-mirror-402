def calculate_total_resistance_and_area(
    points: brainstate.typing.Array,
    resistivity: u.Quantity = 100.0
):
    r"""
    Calculate the total axial resistance and surface area of a neurite represented as N-1 frustums 
    (truncated cones) formed by N 3D points.

    Each pair of adjacent points defines a frustum segment, where:
    - The length of the frustum is the Euclidean distance between two 3D points.
    - The radii of the circular ends are given by half of the corresponding diameters.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    points : array-like of shape (N, 4)
        A list or array of N points, where each point is [x, y, z, diameter].
        These points define the 3D structure of the neurite.
    resistivity : float, optional
        The axial resistivity (Ω·cm), default is 100.0.

    Returns:
    --------
    total_resistance : float
        The total axial resistance across all frustum segments (in Ohms).
        For each frustum segment, resistance is computed as:

            R_i = Ra * L_i / (π * r1_i * r2_i)

        where:
            - L_i is the length (height) of the frustum segment i
            - r1_i and r2_i are the radii of the two ends of the frustum
            - Ra is the resistivity

    total_surface_area : float
        The total lateral surface area of the frustum segments (in μm²).
        For each frustum, surface area is computed as:

            A_i = π * (r1_i + r2_i) * s_i

        where:
            - s_i is the slant height of the frustum:
                s_i = sqrt((r2_i - r1_i)² + L_i²)
            - r1_i and r2_i are the radii of the ends
            - L_i is the vertical height

    Notes:
    ------
    - This function assumes that membrane currents and surface areas are associated 
      with the lateral surfaces of the frustums.
    - The resistivity is assumed uniform across all segments.

    Example:
    --------
         points = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2], [5, 0, 0, 1]])
         R, Area = calculate_total_resistance_and_area(points)

def compute_line_ratios(points: np.ndarray):
    r"""
    Compute the normalized cumulative distance (0 to 1) of each point along a polyline
    defined by 3D coordinates. The output ratio indicates how far along the path 
    each point is, relative to the total length of the line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : array-like of shape (N, 3)
        A NumPy array or list where each row is a 3D coordinate (x, y, z) representing 
        a point along a path (e.g., neurite or dendrite structure).

    Returns
    -------
    ratios : np.ndarray of shape (N,)
        An array where each element is the normalized distance from the first point 
        to the current point, i.e.,

            ratios[i] = (distance from points[0] to points[i]) / total_length

        The first point will always be 0.0, and the last point will be 1.0 (unless all points coincide).

    Notes
    -----
    - If all points are identical (zero length), returns an array of zeros.

    -------

def init_coupling_weight_nodes(g_left, g_right, connection):
    r"""
    Initialize the axial conductance (coupling weight) matrix between segments in a multi-compartment neuron model.

    Parameters:
        g_left (list or array): List of left-side axial conductances for each segment. Length = N_segments.
        g_right (list or array): List of right-side axial conductances for each segment. Length = N_segments.

            - child_index: index of the current segment
            - parent_index: index of the parent segment (-1 if root)
            - site: location on the parent segment where the child connects (typically 1.0 or 0.5)

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An (N x N) symmetric matrix representing the axial coupling conductance between segments.
                    Element [i, j] is the conductance between segment i and j, or 0 if they are not connected.

    Mechanics:
        - If child connects to the **end** of parent segment (site = 1):
            Use the equivalent parallel conductance formula:
                G_ij = g_i * g_j / (g_i + g_j + ...)

            Including parent and all its children connected at site=1:
                If segments {p, c1, c2, ..., cn} connect at parent end:
                    G_pc1 = g_right[p] * g_left[c1] / (g_right[p] + Σ g_left[ci])
                    G_c1c2 = g_left[c1] * g_left[c2] / (g_right[p] + Σ g_left[ci])

        - If child connects to the **middle** of parent segment (site = 0.5):
            Directly add bidirectional conductance:
                G_pc = g_left[c]

    Example:
    >>> g_left = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    >>> g_right = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
    >>> connection = [

            (1, 0, 1.0),  # connects to end of segment 0
            (2, 0, 1.0),  # also connects to end of segment 0
            (3, 1, 0.5)   # connects to middle of segment 1
        ]
    >>> A = init_coupling_weight_nodes(g_left, g_right, connection)

    Explanation:
        - Segment 1 and 2 connect to end of segment 0 → sharing junction conductance with parent 0
        - Segment 3 connects to middle of segment 1 → direct g_left[3] added to G[1,3] and G[3,1]
