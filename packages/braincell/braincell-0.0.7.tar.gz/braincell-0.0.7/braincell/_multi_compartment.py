class MultiCompartment(HHTypedNeuron):
    r"""
    A multi-compartment neuronal model that simulates spatially extended neurons.

    This class implements a detailed neuron model with multiple connected compartments
    that can represent complex dendritic arbors and axons. Each compartment has its own
    membrane potential dynamics and can contain different ion channel distributions.
    The compartments are electrically coupled through axial resistances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : brainstate.typing.Size
        Shape of the neuron population.
    V_th : Union[brainstate.typing.ArrayLike, Callable], optional
        Threshold potential for spike detection in mV. Default is 0.0 mV.
    V_initializer : Union[brainstate.typing.ArrayLike, Callable], optional
        Initial membrane potential or initializer function. Default is uniform random between -70mV and -60mV.
    spk_fun : Callable, optional
        Surrogate gradient function for spike generation. Default is ReluGrad.
    solver : str or Callable, optional
        Numerical integration method. Default is 'exp_euler'.
    name : str, optional
        Name identifier for the neuron model.
    **ion_channels
        Additional keyword arguments for ion channels to be added to the neuron model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    V_th : Quantity or Callable
        Threshold potential for spike detection.
    V_initializer : Quantity or Callable
        Initial membrane potential values or initializer.
    spk_fun : Callable
        Surrogate gradient function used for spike generation.
    solver : Callable
        Numerical integration solver function.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is subclassed from :class:`braincell.HHTypedNeuron`.
    The multi-compartment model simulates the spatial properties of neurons by dividing
    the neuron into electrically connected compartments. Currents can flow between compartments
    based on the voltage differences and axial resistances, allowing for a more accurate
    representation of dendritic integration, action potential propagation, and other
    spatially-dependent phenomena.
