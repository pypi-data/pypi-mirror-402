## About the Project

This project provides a Python implementation of the  
**TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method.

TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique used to rank alternatives based on their distance from the ideal best and ideal worst solutions.
