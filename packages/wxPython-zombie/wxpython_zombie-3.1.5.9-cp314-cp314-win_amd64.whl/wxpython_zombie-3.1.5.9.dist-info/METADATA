**wxPython-zombie** eventually matured to version 3.1.5 of wxWidgets. No more
development, only bug fixes are done, a lot so far. **wxPython-zombie** will
provide the 64-bit binary extension package (build with Visual Studio 2022) for
MS Windows 10/11 and the source package to build for Linux. This is a release for
Python 3.14.

**wxPython-zombie** is forked from commit `64e5d86`__ of wxPython Project Phoenix
on 30 Jan 2021. The included wxWidgets is from the on 14 Apr 2021 released
`wxWidgets 3.1.5`__ . The latest version of the meta build system Waf is used,
released on 13 Nov 2025, `waf 2.1.9`__. Also the latest version of, a Python
bindings generator for C/C++ libraries, SIP is used, released on 20 Dec 2025,
`sip 6.15.1`__. The source distribution format that is now used, is specified
in `PEP 517`__. The binary distribution format (wheel) that is used, is specified
in `PEP 427`__. The Windows wheel was built with `Build Tools for Visual Studio
2022`__, configured for the *Windows SDK (10.0.26100) for Windows 11* and
the *MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools*. The binary distribution no
longer ships with the Microsoft\ :sup:`©` C Runtime Library msvcp140.dll. If
Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable (x64) is not installed on your
machine, install it (you will need administrator rights).

From the console::

    > winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64

You must not install **wxPython** and **wxPython-zombie** in the same environment,
both packages use the package directory ``wx``.

The build and installation on Linux was tested on Arch Linux, with just the
minimal explicit installed packages or groups linux, base, base-devel, webkit2gtk,
glu, sdl2 and pyenv. With pyenv, Python 3.14.2 was installed and used. The build
will take about 15 to 40 minutes, depending on your system. To see the verbose
progress of the build process, use the verbose option in pip.

The demo package of **wxPython-zombie** is included in the distribution.
