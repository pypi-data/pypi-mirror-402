(_MUon fLuxme'DER_)


## Description

Mulder is a Python package that calculates variations in the flux of atmospheric
muons caused by a geometry of interest, e.g. a topography depicted by a Digital
Elevation Model ([DEM][DEM]).

The primary component of Mulder is a fluxmeter, which serves as a muons probe.
The level of detail of fluxmeters is adjustable, ranging from a rapid continuous
approximation, that provides an average flux estimate, to a comprehensive Monte
Carlo, that delivers discrete atmospheric muons.

Please refer to the online [documentation][RTD] for further information.


## Installation

Binary distributions of Mulder are available from [PyPI][PyPI], for Linux, OSX
and Windows as

```
pip3 install mulder
```

Alternatively, in order to build Mulder from the source, the [Rust
toolchain][RUST_TOOLCHAIN] is required. Please refer to the corresponding
[documentation][RTD_INSTALLATION] entry for further instructions.
