## Getting Started

</div>

## Prerequisites

- `3.8` <= Python <= `3.12`

We recommend users to create a virtual environment before installing any dependencies. For more information on virtual environments, please refer to:

- [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html)
- [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade datature
```

---

## Python Usage

For a full list of documentation and examples, please refer to the [API docs](https://developers.datature.io/docs/python-sdk).

### Authentication

To get started, you will first need to create a project on [Datature Nexus](https://www.datature.io/nexus?utm_source=github) (you can create sign up for a free account [here](https://nexus.datature.io/)). You will then need to locate the [project secret key](https://developers.datature.io/docs/project-keys-and-secret-keys). This key can only be accessed if you are the Project Owner or have been granted elevated permissions by the Project Owner, and will be used for all subsequent authentication when invoking the various SDK functions.

### Examples

To list projects:

```python
from datature import nexus

client = nexus.Client("31a9f0dd997cb632765fc0d222369f6106327c3d20719d31f6ffafe51708f117")
projects = client.list_projects()
```

To upload assets:

```python
import os
from datature import nexus

logging.basicConfig()
client = nexus.Client("31a9f0dd997cb632765fc0d222369f6106327c3d20719d31f6ffafe51708f117")
project = client.get_project("fca32b1bb15405d1c2bde19fd90b516d")

upload_session = project.assets.create_upload_session(groups=["dataset"])
with upload_session as session:
  session.add_path("/Users/dataset")
print(len(upload_session))
```

### Logging

You can vary the logging level depending on your task or use case (such as `DEBUG` to provide more insights), but the default `INFO` level is typically best suited for production use.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger("datature-nexus").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

---

## CLI Usage

For a full list of documentation and examples, please refer to the [CLI docs](https://developers.datature.io/docs/cli).

### Authentication

To get started, you will first need to create a project on [Datature Nexus](https://www.datature.io/nexus?utm_source=github) (you can create sign up for a free account [here](https://nexus.datature.io/)). You will then need to locate the [project secret key](https://developers.datature.io/docs/project-keys-and-secret-keys). This key can only be accessed if you are the Project Owner or have been granted elevated permissions by the Project Owner, and will be used for all subsequent authentication when invoking the various SDK functions.

Once you have the project secret, you will now be able to make API requests using the CLI by entering the command `datature projects auth`:

```bash
datature projects auth
[?] Enter the project secret: ************************************************
[?] Make [Your Project Name] the default project? (Y/n): y

Authentication succeeded.
```

You will now be able to run your desired CLI commands as outlined above. To see all possible functions as well as view the required inputs and expected outputs, check out the following documentation.

## FAQ

### How do I find my Secret Key and Project Key?

We provide a step-by-step guide to finding these two crucial keys in our [Developer's Documentation](https://developers.datature.io/docs/project-keys-and-secret-keys). You can also explore the other sections under [Python SDK](https://developers.datature.io/docs/python-sdk) to learn more about the full functionality and feature set.

### I'm facing some issues, what now?

We're sorry to hear that, please head over to our [Issues](https://github.com/datature/datature-py/issues) page and post a detailed bug report following our guidelines, and we will address your concerns as soon as we can. Alternatively, ping us in our [Community Slack](https://datature.io/community) where our engineers will attend to your needs.

### I've noticed that some features are missing, how do I contribute?

Datature Python SDK is open-source and we welcome everyone to help to improve it. Please check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can be a part of the team.

### How do I resolve the `command not found: datature` error for the CLI?

The `command not found: datature` error indicates that the Datature SDK/CLI tool is not installed properly in your system's PATH, or it has not been installed at all. To resolve this error, please follow these steps:

#### Ensure Datature CLI is Installed

Before anything else, verify that you've installed the Datature CLI. You can install it using pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install datature
```

If you're using a virtual environment (which is recommended), ensure that it's activated before running the installation command.

#### Check Your PATH

After installation, the datature command should be automatically added to your system's PATH. If it's not found, you may need to manually add the directory containing the datature executable to your PATH:

```bash
which datature
```

Or

```bash
pip show datature
```

As expected, it will show the location of the package like this:

```bash
Location: /Users/.pyenv/versions/3.8.18/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```

#### Add the Path to Your Profile

Open your shell profile file with a text editor. This file could be one of ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc., depending on which shell you use and the specific configuration of your operating system.

For example, you can add the path using the following command:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/datature"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Replace /path/to/datature with the actual path you found with which datature or pip show datature.

#### Restart Your Terminal

Sometimes, changes to the PATH environment variable do not take effect until you open a new terminal session. After installation or modification of the PATH, close your current terminal and open a new one, then try the command again.
