    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nverchev/drytorch/blob/main/docs/tutorials/trackers.ipynb)\n",
    "DRYTorch uses a subscription-based event system for logging and\n",
    "visualization, delegating implementation to external libraries via **trackers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how trackers work and how to write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Principles\n",
    "DRYTorch's philosophy of replicability and reusability is embodied in its **tracker system**. Trackers allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reproduce someone else's machine learning workflow while keeping logs in your preferred format.\n",
    "* Reuse custom trackers across multiple projects with minimal code changes.\n",
    "* Log, plot, and structure information without affecting the experiment logic.\n",
    "* Ensure your experiment's completion even in case of a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "A **tracker** is an object responsible for **logging and plotting**. It:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Receives notifications about events happening during an experiment.\n",
    "* Does **not** intervene in the training, evaluation, or inference logic.\n",
    "* Does **not** alter the behavior of other trackers. Trackers are completely independent."

    "### Default Trackers\n",
    "\n",
    "DRYTorch default trackers are subscribed to every experiment upon instantiation.\n",
    "In standard mode, these are:\n",
    "- `trackers.builtin_logging.BuiltinLogger` - handles the \"drytorch\" logger from the standard library\n",
    "- `trackers.tqdm.TqdmLogger` - for progress bars (when `tqdm` is available)\n",
    "- `trackers.yaml.YamlDumper` - to dump metadata (when `PyAML` is available)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modes\n",
    "DRYTorch offers carefully designed configurations, or initialization modes,\n",
    "for the default trackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available initialization modes:\n",
    "- **standard**: log to stderr, preferring `tqdm` over the built-in logger.\n",
    "- **hydra**: log to stdout and accommodate default Hydra settings.\n",
    "- **minimal**: reduce output and avoid dumping metadata.\n",
    "- **none**: no default trackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the mode by assigning a mode to a `DRYTORCH_INIT_MODE` environment variable or reinitializing the trackers with `init_trackers`."

    "### Optional Trackers\n",
    "\n",
    "DRYTorch also provides a variety of **optional trackers**, many of which rely on external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available optional trackers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `trackers.csv.CSVDumper` — creates a separate CSV file for each logging actor.\n",
    "* `trackers.hydra.HydraLink` — links (and optionally copies) the Hydra output folder.\n",
    "* `trackers.matplotlib.MatPlotter` — plots metrics and returns a `matplotlib` figure.\n",
    "* `trackers.plotly.PlotlyPlotter` — plots metrics and returns a `plotly` figure.\n",
    "* `trackers.sqlalchemy.SQLConnection` — creates a full SQL database for structured logging.\n",
    "* `trackers.tensorboard.TensorBoard` — launches a TensorBoard server and logs metrics.\n",
    "* `trackers.visdom.VisdomPlotter` — launches a Visdom server and logs metrics.\n",
    "* `trackers.wandb.Wandb` — logs metrics and configuration to Weights & Biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these trackers offer additional customization parameters. For example,\n",
    "`trackers.wandb.Wandb` accepts a `wandb.sdk.wandb_settings.Settings` object containing all the options are normally passed to `wandb.init`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several optional trackers act as **dumpers**, meaning they store metadata directly on disk. Dumpers typically accept a `par_dir` argument to control the output directory. If no directory is provided, DRYTorch falls back to a standardized, time‑stamped folder structure based on the experiment’s name and start time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`trackers.plotly.PlotlyPlotter`, `trackers.matplotlib.MatPlotter` and `trackers.visdom.VisdomPlotter` are instead **plotters**.\n",
    "Plotters implement the `plot_metric` method, keep track of the metrics during the current session and can also load metrics from a previous session when initialized with a `MetricLoader`.\n",
    "DryTorch offers two `MetricLoader`s out of the box: `trackers.sqlalchemy.SQLConnection` and `trackers.csv.CSVDumper` .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a Tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a tracker, subscribe it to an experiment before running it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_experiment.trackers.subscribe(my_tracker)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, use `drytorch.extend_default_trackers` to add a tracker to every experiment by default."

    "## Write a Custom Tracker\n",
    "To write a custom tracker, it is important to first know the Event System\n",
    "that calls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event System\n",
    "\n",
    "To decouple experiment logic from logging, DRYTorch uses an **event-based architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During an experiment, different parts of the code emit **events**.\n",
    "2. All trackers **subscribed** to the running experiment receive the event.\n",
    "3. Each tracker decides **how to log or visualize** the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "DRYTorch comes already with various **event classes** representing specific moments of the experiment's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "These events are created by the core `Experiment` class, as well as by many library implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of all built‑in events.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Experiment Lifecycle Events\n",
    "\n",
    "* **StartExperimentEvent** — emitted when an experiment begins. Includes configuration, run ID, timestamp, tags, and resume state.\n",
    "* **StopExperimentEvent** — emitted when an experiment finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model‑Related Events\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ModelRegistrationEvent** — emitted when a model is instantiated. Contains a timestamp and a string representation of the architecture.\n",
    "* **SaveModelEvent** — emitted when a checkpoint is saved (name, definition, location, epoch).\n",
    "* **LoadModelEvent** — emitted when a model is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Actor / Source Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ActorRegistrationEvent** — records when an object (trainer, evaluator, etc.) is registered as a source of events related to a specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training Workflow Events\n",
    "\n",
    "* **StartTrainingEvent** — emitted at the start of training, including start and end epoch.\n",
    "* **StartEpochEvent** — marks the beginning of an epoch.\n",
    "* **EndEpochEvent** — marks the end of an epoch.\n",
    "* **IterateBatchEvent** — emitted during batch iteration. Supports `update()` callbacks for loggers that require push updates.\n",
    "* **TerminatedTrainingEvent** — emitted when training is prematurely terminated, including the reason.\n",
    "* **EndTrainingEvent** — emitted when training completes normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Testing Workflow Events\n",
    "\n",
    "* **StartTestEvent** — emitted when testing starts.\n",
    "* **EndTestEvent** — emitted when testing ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Metric‑Related Events\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MetricEvent** — emitted when aggregated metrics are computed.\n",
    "* **LearningRateEvent** — emitted when learning rates are updated by a scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "These events form the backbone of the DRYTorch logging and tracker ecosystem and are automatically published upon creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tracker class\n",
    "To write custom tracker it is necessary to subclass the `core.track.Tracker` class and override its `notify` method.\n",
    "You can also overwrite the `clean_up` method, which is called when\n",
    "the experiment stops running, provided that:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@functools.singledispatchmethod\n",
    "@override\n",
    "def notify(self, event: log_events.Event) -> None:\n",
    "    return super().notify(event)\n",
    "\n",
    "@notify.register\n",
    "def _(self, event: log_events.StopExperimentEvent) -> None:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return super().notify(event)\n",
    "```\n",
    "calls the `super().notify` method, which is also always recommended."
