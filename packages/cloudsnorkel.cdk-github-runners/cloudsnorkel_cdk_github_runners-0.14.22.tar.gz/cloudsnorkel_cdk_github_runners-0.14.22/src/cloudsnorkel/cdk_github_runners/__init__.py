Use this CDK construct to create ephemeral [self-hosted GitHub runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) on-demand inside your AWS account.

* 🧩 Easy to configure GitHub integration with a web-based interface
* 🧠 Customizable runners with decent defaults
* 🏃🏻 Multiple runner configurations controlled by labels
* 🔐 Everything fully hosted in your account
* 🔃 Automatically updated build environment with latest runner version

Self-hosted runners in AWS are useful when:

* You need easy access to internal resources in your actions
* You want to pre-install some software for your actions
* You want to provide some basic AWS API access (but [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions) has more security controls)
* You are using GitHub Enterprise Server

Ephemeral (or on-demand) runners are the [recommended way by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners#using-ephemeral-runners-for-autoscaling) for auto-scaling, and they make sure all jobs run with a clean image. Runners are started on-demand. You don't pay unless a job is running.

## API

The best way to browse API documentation is on [Constructs Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/@cloudsnorkel/cdk-github-runners/). It is available in all supported programming languages.

## Providers

A runner provider creates compute resources on-demand and uses [actions/runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) to start a runner.

| **OS**           | Linux, Windows    | Linux, Windows             | Linux, Windows | Linux, Windows | Linux         |

The best provider to use mostly depends on your current infrastructure. When in doubt, CodeBuild is always a good choice. Execution history and logs are easy to view, and it has no restrictive limits unless you need to run for more than 8 hours.

* EC2 is useful when you want runners to have complete access to the host
* ECS is useful when you want to control the infrastructure, like leaving the runner host running for faster startups
* Lambda is useful for short jobs that can work within time, size and readonly system constraints

You can also create your own provider by implementing `IRunnerProvider`.

2. Use `GitHubRunners` construct in your code (starting with default arguments is fine)
3. Deploy your stack
4. Look for the status command output similar to `aws --region us-east-1 lambda invoke --function-name status-XYZ123 status.json`

   ```
    ✅  github-runners-test

   ✨  Deployment time: 260.01s

   Outputs:
   github-runners-test.runnersstatuscommand4A30F0F5 = aws --region us-east-1 lambda invoke --function-name github-runners-test-runnersstatus1A5771C0-mvttg8oPQnQS status.json
   ```
5. Execute the status command (you may need to specify `--profile` too) and open the resulting `status.json` file
6. Open the URL in `github.setup.url` from `status.json` or [manually setup GitHub](SETUP_GITHUB.md) integration as an app or with personal access token
7. Run status command again to confirm `github.auth.status` and `github.webhook.status` are OK
8. Trigger a GitHub action that has a `self-hosted` label with `runs-on: [self-hosted, codebuild]` (or non-default labels you set in step 2)
9. If the action is not successful, see [troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting)

## Customizing

The default providers configured by `GitHubRunners` are useful for testing but probably not too much for actual production work. They run in the default VPC or no VPC and have no added IAM permissions. You would usually want to configure the providers yourself.

For example:

```python
let vpc: ec2.Vpc;
let runnerSg: ec2.SecurityGroup;
let dbSg: ec2.SecurityGroup;
let bucket: s3.Bucket;

// create a custom CodeBuild provider
const myProvider = new CodeBuildRunnerProvider(this, 'codebuild runner', {
   labels: ['my-codebuild'],
   vpc: vpc,
   securityGroups: [runnerSg],
});
// grant some permissions to the provider
bucket.grantReadWrite(myProvider);
dbSg.connections.allowFrom(runnerSg, ec2.Port.tcp(3306), 'allow runners to connect to MySQL database');

// create the runner infrastructure
new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
   providers: [myProvider],
});
```

Another way to customize runners is by modifying the image used to spin them up. The image contains the [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner), any required dependencies, and integration code with the provider. You may choose to customize this image by adding more packages, for example.

```python
const myBuilder = FargateRunnerProvider.imageBuilder(this, 'image builder');
myBuilder.addComponent(
  RunnerImageComponent.custom({ commands: ['apt install -y nginx xz-utils'] }),
);

const myProvider = new FargateRunnerProvider(this, 'fargate runner', {
   labels: ['customized-fargate'],
   imageBuilder: myBuilder,
});

// create the runner infrastructure
new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
   providers: [myProvider],
});
```

Your workflow will then look like:

```yaml
name: self-hosted example
on: push
jobs:
  self-hosted:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, customized-fargate]
    steps:
      - run: echo hello world
```

Windows images can also be customized the same way.

```python
const myWindowsBuilder = FargateRunnerProvider.imageBuilder(this, 'Windows image builder', {
   architecture: Architecture.X86_64,
   os: Os.WINDOWS,
});
myWindowsBuilder.addComponent(
   RunnerImageComponent.custom({
     name: 'Ninja',
     commands: [
       'Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/download/v1.11.1/ninja-win.zip" -OutFile ninja.zip',
       'Expand-Archive ninja.zip -DestinationPath C:\\actions',
       'del ninja.zip',
     ],
   }),
);

const myProvider = new FargateRunnerProvider(this, 'fargate runner', {
   labels: ['customized-windows-fargate'],
   imageBuilder: myWindowsBuilder,
});

new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
   providers: [myProvider],
});
```

The runner OS and architecture is determined by the image it is set to use. For example, to create a Fargate runner provider for ARM64 set the `architecture` property for the image builder to `Architecture.ARM64` in the image builder properties.

```python
new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
   providers: [
      new FargateRunnerProvider(this, 'fargate runner', {
         labels: ['arm64', 'fargate'],
         imageBuilder: FargateRunnerProvider.imageBuilder(this, 'image builder', {
            architecture: Architecture.ARM64,
            os: Os.LINUX_UBUNTU,
         }),
      }),
   ],
});
```

### Composite Providers

Composite providers allow you to combine multiple runner providers with different strategies. There are two types:

**Fallback Strategy**: Try providers in order until one succeeds. Useful for trying spot instances first, then falling back to on-demand if spot capacity is unavailable.

```python
// Try spot instances first, fall back to on-demand if spot is unavailable
const ecsFallback = CompositeProvider.fallback(this, 'ECS Fallback', [
  new EcsRunnerProvider(this, 'ECS Spot', {
    labels: ['ecs', 'linux', 'x64'],
    spot: true,
    // ... other config
  }),
  new EcsRunnerProvider(this, 'ECS On-Demand', {
    labels: ['ecs', 'linux', 'x64'],
    spot: false,
    // ... other config
  }),
]);

new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
  providers: [ecsFallback],
});
```

**Weighted Distribution Strategy**: Randomly select a provider based on weights. Useful for distributing load across multiple availability zones or instance types.

```python
// Distribute 60% of traffic to AZ-1, 40% to AZ-2
const distributedProvider = CompositeProvider.distribute(this, 'Fargate Distribution', [
  {
    weight: 3, // 3/(3+2) = 60%
    provider: new FargateRunnerProvider(this, 'Fargate AZ-1', {
      labels: ['fargate', 'linux', 'x64'],
      subnetSelection: vpc.selectSubnets({
        availabilityZones: [vpc.availabilityZones[0]],
      }),
      // ... other config
    }),
  },
  {
    weight: 2, // 2/(3+2) = 40%
    provider: new FargateRunnerProvider(this, 'Fargate AZ-2', {
      labels: ['fargate', 'linux', 'x64'],
      subnetSelection: vpc.selectSubnets({
        availabilityZones: [vpc.availabilityZones[1]],
      }),
      // ... other config
    }),
  },
]);

new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
  providers: [distributedProvider],
});
```

**Important**: All providers in a composite must have the exact same labels. This ensures any provisioned runner can match the labels requested by the GitHub workflow job.

### Custom Provider Selection

By default, providers are selected based on label matching: the first provider that has all the labels requested by the job is selected. You can customize this behavior using a provider selector Lambda function to:

* Filter out certain jobs (prevent runner provisioning)
* Dynamically select a provider based on job characteristics (repository, branch, time of day, etc.)
* Customize labels for the runner (add, remove, or modify labels dynamically)

The selector function receives the full GitHub webhook payload, a map of all available providers and their labels, and the default provider/labels that would have been selected. It returns the provider to use (or `undefined` to skip runner creation) and the labels to assign to the runner.

**Example: Route jobs to different providers based on repository**

```python
import { ComputeType } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-codebuild';
import { Function, Code, Runtime } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import { GitHubRunners, CodeBuildRunnerProvider } from '@cloudsnorkel/cdk-github-runners';

const defaultProvider = new CodeBuildRunnerProvider(this, 'default', {
  labels: ['custom-runner', 'default'],
});
const productionProvider = new CodeBuildRunnerProvider(this, 'production', {
  labels: ['custom-runner', 'production'],
  computeType: ComputeType.LARGE,
});

const providerSelector = new Function(this, 'provider-selector', {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline(`
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
      const { payload, providers, defaultProvider, defaultLabels } = event;

      // Route production repos to dedicated provider
      if (payload.repository.name.includes('prod')) {
        return {
          provider: '${productionProvider.node.path}',
          labels: ['custom-runner', 'production', 'modified-via-selector'],
        };
      }

      // Filter out draft PRs
      if (payload.workflow_job.head_branch?.startsWith('draft/')) {
        return { provider: undefined }; // Skip runner provisioning
      }

      // Use default for everything else
      return {
        provider: defaultProvider,
        labels: defaultLabels,
      };
    };
  `),
});

new GitHubRunners(this, 'runners', {
   providers: [defaultProvider, productionProvider],
   providerSelector: providerSelector,
});
```

**Example: Add dynamic labels based on job metadata**

```python
const providerSelector = new Function(this, 'provider-selector', {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline(`
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
      const { payload, defaultProvider, defaultLabels } = event;

      // Add branch name as a label
      const branch = payload.workflow_job.head_branch || 'unknown';
      const labels = [...(defaultLabels || []), 'branch:' + branch];

      return {
        provider: defaultProvider,
        labels: labels,
      };
    };
  `),
});
```

**Important considerations:**

* ⚠️ **Label matching responsibility**: You are responsible for ensuring the selected provider's labels match what the job requires. If labels don't match, the runner will be provisioned but GitHub Actions won't assign the job to it.
* ⚠️ **No guarantee of assignment**: Provider selection only determines which provider will provision a runner. GitHub Actions may still route the job to any available runner with matching labels. For reliable provider assignment, consider repo-level runner registration (the default).
* ⚡ **Performance**: The selector runs synchronously during webhook processing. Keep it fast and efficient—the webhook has a 30-second timeout total.

## Troubleshooting

Runners are started in response to a webhook coming in from GitHub. If there are any issues starting the runner like missing capacity or transient API issues, the provider will keep retrying for 24 hours. Configuration issue related errors like pointing to a missing AMI will not be retried. GitHub itself will cancel the job if it can't find a runner for 24 hours. If your jobs don't start, follow the steps below to examine all parts of this workflow.

1. Always start with the status function, make sure no errors are reported, and confirm all status codes are OK
2. Make sure `runs-on` in the workflow matches the expected labels set in the runner provider
3. Diagnose relevant executions of the orchestrator step function by visiting the URL in `troubleshooting.stepFunctionUrl` from `status.json`

   1. If the execution failed, check your runner provider configuration for errors
   2. If the execution is still running for a long time, check the execution events to see why runner starting is being retried
   3. If there are no relevant executions, move to the next step
4. Confirm the webhook Lambda was called by visiting the URL in `troubleshooting.webhookHandlerUrl` from `status.json`

   1. If it's not called or logs errors, confirm the webhook settings on the GitHub side
   2. If you see too many errors, make sure you're only sending `workflow_job` events
5. When using GitHub app, make sure there are active installations in `github.auth.app.installations`

All logs are saved in CloudWatch.

* Log group names can be found in `status.json` for each provider, image builder, and other parts of the system
* Some useful Logs Insights queries can be enabled with `GitHubRunners.createLogsInsightsQueries()`

To get `status.json`, check out the CloudFormation stack output for a command that generates it. The command looks like:

```
aws --region us-east-1 lambda invoke --function-name status-XYZ123 status.json
```

## Monitoring

There are two important ways to monitor your runners:

1. Make sure runners don't fail to start. When that happens, jobs may sit and wait. Use `GitHubRunners.metricFailed()` to get a metric for the number of failed runner starts. You should use this metric to trigger an alarm.
2. Make sure runner images don't fail to build. Failed runner image builds mean you will get stuck with out-of-date software on your runners. It may lead to security vulnerabilities, or it may lead to slower runner start-ups as the runner software itself needs to be updated. Use `GitHubRunners.failedImageBuildsTopic()` to get SNS topic that gets notified of failed runner image builds. You should subscribe to this topic.

Other useful metrics to track:

1. Use `GitHubRunners.metricJobCompleted()` to get a metric for the number of completed jobs broken down by labels and job success.
2. Use `GitHubRunners.metricTime()` to get a metric for the total time a runner is running. This includes the overhead of starting the runner.

        :param providers: (experimental) List of runner providers to use. At least one provider is required. Provider will be selected when its label matches the labels requested by the workflow job. Default: CodeBuild, Lambda and Fargate runners with all the defaults (no VPC or default account VPC)
        :param provider_selector: (experimental) Optional Lambda function to customize provider selection logic and label assignment. - The function receives the webhook payload along with default provider and its labels as {@link ProviderSelectorInput } - The function returns a selected provider and its labels as {@link ProviderSelectorResult } - You can decline to provision a runner by returning undefined as the provider selector result - You can fully customize the labels for the about-to-be-provisioned runner (add, remove, modify, dynamic labels, etc.) - Labels don't have to match the labels originally configured for the provider, but see warnings below - This function will be called synchronously during webhook processing, so it should be fast and efficient (webhook limit is 30 seconds total) **WARNING: It is your responsibility to ensure the selected provider's labels match the job's required labels. If you return the wrong labels, the runner will be created but GitHub Actions will not assign the job to it.** **WARNING: Provider selection is not a guarantee that a specific provider will be assigned for the job. GitHub Actions may assign the job to any runner with matching labels. The provider selector only determines which provider's runner will be *created*, but GitHub Actions may route the job to any available runner with the required labels.** **For reliable provider assignment based on job characteristics, consider using repo-level runner registration where you can control which runners are available for specific repositories. See {@link SETUP_GITHUB.md } for more details on the different registration levels. This information is also available while using the setup wizard.
        :param require_self_hosted_label: (experimental) Whether to require the ``self-hosted`` label. If ``true``, the runner will only start if the workflow job explicitly requests the ``self-hosted`` label. Be careful when setting this to ``false``. Avoid setting up providers with generic label requirements like ``linux`` as they may match workflows that are not meant to run on self-hosted runners. Default: true
        :param retry_options: (experimental) Options to retry operation in case of failure like missing capacity, or API quota issues. GitHub jobs time out after not being able to get a runner for 24 hours. You should not retry for more than 24 hours. Total time spent waiting can be calculated with interval * (backoffRate ^ maxAttempts) / (backoffRate - 1). Default: retry 23 times up to about 24 hours
        :param security_group: (deprecated) Security group attached to all management functions. Use this with to provide access to GitHub Enterprise Server hosted inside a VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security groups attached to all management functions. Use this to provide outbound access from management functions to GitHub Enterprise Server hosted inside a VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting. **Note:** Defining inbound rules on this security group does nothing. This security group only controls outbound access FROM the management functions. To limit access TO the webhook or setup functions, use {@link webhookAccess} and {@link setupAccess} instead.
        :param setup_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the setup function. Once you finish the setup process, you can set this to ``LambdaAccess.noAccess()`` to remove access to the setup function. You can also use ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({ allowedIps: ['my-ip/0']})`` to limit access to your IP only. Default: LambdaAccess.lambdaUrl()
        :param status_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the status function. This function returns a lot of sensitive information about the runner, so you should only allow access to it from trusted IPs, if at all. Default: LambdaAccess.noAccess()
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC used for all management functions. Use this with GitHub Enterprise Server hosted that's inaccessible from outside the VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting and will run outside the VPC. Make sure the selected VPC and subnets have access to the following with either NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoints: - GitHub Enterprise Server - Secrets Manager - SQS - Step Functions - CloudFormation (status function only) - EC2 (status function only) - ECR (status function only)
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) VPC subnets used for all management functions. Use this with GitHub Enterprise Server hosted that's inaccessible from outside the VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting.
        :param webhook_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the webhook function. This function is called by GitHub when a new workflow job is scheduled. For an extra layer of security, you can set this to ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({ allowedIps: LambdaAccess.githubWebhookIps() })``. You can also set this to ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({allowedVpc: vpc, allowedIps: ['GHES.IP.ADDRESS/32']})`` if your GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted in a VPC. This will create an API Gateway endpoint that's only accessible from within the VPC. *WARNING*: changing access type may change the URL. When the URL changes, you must update GitHub as well. Default: LambdaAccess.lambdaUrl()

        '''(experimental) Properties for GitHubRunners.

        :param allow_public_subnet: (experimental) Allow management functions to run in public subnets. Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting. Default: false
        :param extra_certificates: (experimental) Path to a certificate file (.pem or .crt) or a directory containing certificate files (.pem or .crt) required to trust GitHub Enterprise Server. Use this when GitHub Enterprise Server certificates are self-signed. If a directory is provided, all .pem and .crt files in that directory will be used. The certificates will be concatenated into a single file for use by Node.js. You may also want to use custom images for your runner providers that contain the same certificates. See {@link RunnerImageComponent.extraCertificates }:: const selfSignedCertificates = 'certs/ghes.pem'; // or 'path-to-my-extra-certs-folder' for a directory const imageBuilder = CodeBuildRunnerProvider.imageBuilder(this, 'Image Builder with Certs'); imageBuilder.addComponent(RunnerImageComponent.extraCertificates(selfSignedCertificates, 'private-ca')); const provider = new CodeBuildRunnerProvider(this, 'CodeBuild', { imageBuilder: imageBuilder, }); new GitHubRunners( this, 'runners', { providers: [provider], extraCertificates: selfSignedCertificates, } );
        :param idle_timeout: (experimental) Time to wait before stopping a runner that remains idle. If the user cancelled the job, or if another runner stole it, this stops the runner to avoid wasting resources. Default: 5 minutes
        :param log_options: (experimental) Logging options for the state machine that manages the runners. Default: no logs
        :param providers: (experimental) List of runner providers to use. At least one provider is required. Provider will be selected when its label matches the labels requested by the workflow job. Default: CodeBuild, Lambda and Fargate runners with all the defaults (no VPC or default account VPC)
        :param provider_selector: (experimental) Optional Lambda function to customize provider selection logic and label assignment. - The function receives the webhook payload along with default provider and its labels as {@link ProviderSelectorInput } - The function returns a selected provider and its labels as {@link ProviderSelectorResult } - You can decline to provision a runner by returning undefined as the provider selector result - You can fully customize the labels for the about-to-be-provisioned runner (add, remove, modify, dynamic labels, etc.) - Labels don't have to match the labels originally configured for the provider, but see warnings below - This function will be called synchronously during webhook processing, so it should be fast and efficient (webhook limit is 30 seconds total) **WARNING: It is your responsibility to ensure the selected provider's labels match the job's required labels. If you return the wrong labels, the runner will be created but GitHub Actions will not assign the job to it.** **WARNING: Provider selection is not a guarantee that a specific provider will be assigned for the job. GitHub Actions may assign the job to any runner with matching labels. The provider selector only determines which provider's runner will be *created*, but GitHub Actions may route the job to any available runner with the required labels.** **For reliable provider assignment based on job characteristics, consider using repo-level runner registration where you can control which runners are available for specific repositories. See {@link SETUP_GITHUB.md } for more details on the different registration levels. This information is also available while using the setup wizard.
        :param require_self_hosted_label: (experimental) Whether to require the ``self-hosted`` label. If ``true``, the runner will only start if the workflow job explicitly requests the ``self-hosted`` label. Be careful when setting this to ``false``. Avoid setting up providers with generic label requirements like ``linux`` as they may match workflows that are not meant to run on self-hosted runners. Default: true
        :param retry_options: (experimental) Options to retry operation in case of failure like missing capacity, or API quota issues. GitHub jobs time out after not being able to get a runner for 24 hours. You should not retry for more than 24 hours. Total time spent waiting can be calculated with interval * (backoffRate ^ maxAttempts) / (backoffRate - 1). Default: retry 23 times up to about 24 hours
        :param security_group: (deprecated) Security group attached to all management functions. Use this with to provide access to GitHub Enterprise Server hosted inside a VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security groups attached to all management functions. Use this to provide outbound access from management functions to GitHub Enterprise Server hosted inside a VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting. **Note:** Defining inbound rules on this security group does nothing. This security group only controls outbound access FROM the management functions. To limit access TO the webhook or setup functions, use {@link webhookAccess} and {@link setupAccess} instead.
        :param setup_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the setup function. Once you finish the setup process, you can set this to ``LambdaAccess.noAccess()`` to remove access to the setup function. You can also use ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({ allowedIps: ['my-ip/0']})`` to limit access to your IP only. Default: LambdaAccess.lambdaUrl()
        :param status_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the status function. This function returns a lot of sensitive information about the runner, so you should only allow access to it from trusted IPs, if at all. Default: LambdaAccess.noAccess()
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC used for all management functions. Use this with GitHub Enterprise Server hosted that's inaccessible from outside the VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting and will run outside the VPC. Make sure the selected VPC and subnets have access to the following with either NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoints: - GitHub Enterprise Server - Secrets Manager - SQS - Step Functions - CloudFormation (status function only) - EC2 (status function only) - ECR (status function only)
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) VPC subnets used for all management functions. Use this with GitHub Enterprise Server hosted that's inaccessible from outside the VPC. **Note:** This only affects management functions that interact with GitHub. Lambda functions that help with runner image building and don't interact with GitHub are NOT affected by this setting.
        :param webhook_access: (experimental) Access configuration for the webhook function. This function is called by GitHub when a new workflow job is scheduled. For an extra layer of security, you can set this to ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({ allowedIps: LambdaAccess.githubWebhookIps() })``. You can also set this to ``LambdaAccess.apiGateway({allowedVpc: vpc, allowedIps: ['GHES.IP.ADDRESS/32']})`` if your GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted in a VPC. This will create an API Gateway endpoint that's only accessible from within the VPC. *WARNING*: changing access type may change the URL. When the URL changes, you must update GitHub as well. Default: LambdaAccess.lambdaUrl()

This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY

However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        :param base_ami: (experimental) Base AMI from which runner AMIs will be built. This can be: - A string (AMI ID, Image Builder ARN, SSM parameter reference, or Marketplace product ID) - deprecated, use BaseImage static factory methods instead - A BaseImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseImage.fromAmiId('ami-12345')`` - Use an AMI ID - ``BaseImage.fromString('arn:aws:imagebuilder:...')`` - Use any string (ARN, AMI ID, etc.) - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameter(parameter)`` - Use an SSM parameter object - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameterName('/aws/service/ami/...')`` - Use an SSM parameter by name - ``BaseImage.fromMarketplaceProductId('product-id')`` - Use a Marketplace product ID - ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` - Use an AWS-provided Image Builder image For example ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` would always use the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 in each build. If you want a specific version, you can pass the version as the third parameter. Default: latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, Ubuntu 24.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, latest Windows Server 2022 AMI for Os.WINDOWS
        :param base_docker_image: (experimental) Base image from which Docker runner images will be built. This can be: - A string (ECR/ECR public image URI, DockerHub image, or Image Builder ARN) - deprecated, use BaseContainerImage static factory methods instead - A BaseContainerImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseContainerImage.fromDockerHub('ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use DockerHub - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcr(repo, 'latest')`` - Use ECR (automatically grants permissions with CodeBuild) - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcrPublic('lts', 'ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use ECR Public - ``BaseContainerImage.fromString('public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04')`` - Use any string When using private images from a different account or not on ECR, you may need to include additional setup commands with {@link dockerSetupCommands}. Default: public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:24.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:2 for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019-amd64 for Os.WINDOWS
        :param builder_type: Default: CodeBuild for Linux Docker image, AWS Image Builder for Windows Docker image and any AMI
        :param code_build_options: (experimental) Options specific to CodeBuild image builder. Only used when builderType is RunnerImageBuilderType.CODE_BUILD.
        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
        :param os: (experimental) Image OS. Default: OS.LINUX_UBUNTU
        :param rebuild_interval: (experimental) Schedule the image to be rebuilt every given interval. Useful for keeping the image up-do-date with the latest GitHub runner version and latest OS updates. Set to zero to disable. Default: Duration.days(7)
        :param runner_version: (experimental) Version of GitHub Runners to install. Default: latest version available
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security Groups to assign to this instance.
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Default: no subnet
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH

        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        - MEDIUM: 4 vCPU, 7 GB RAM, 128 GB disk
        - LARGE: 8 vCPU, 15 GB RAM, 128 GB disk
        - X2_LARGE: 72 vCPU, 145 GB RAM, 256 GB disk (Linux) or 824 GB disk (Windows)

        Use a larger compute type when you need more disk space for building larger Docker images.

    Builders can be used with runner providers.

    The CodeBuild builder is better and faster. Only use this one if you have no choice. For example, if you need Windows containers.

    Each builder re-runs automatically at a set interval to make sure the images contain the latest versions of everything.

    You can create an instance of this construct to customize the image used to spin-up runners. Some runner providers may require custom components. Check the runner provider documentation. The default components work with CodeBuild and Fargate.

    For example, to set a specific runner version, rebuild the image every 2 weeks, and add a few packages for the Fargate provider, use::

       const builder = new ContainerImageBuilder(this, 'Builder', {

        :param base_ami: (experimental) Base AMI from which runner AMIs will be built. This can be: - A string (AMI ID, Image Builder ARN, SSM parameter reference, or Marketplace product ID) - deprecated, use BaseImage static factory methods instead - A BaseImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseImage.fromAmiId('ami-12345')`` - Use an AMI ID - ``BaseImage.fromString('arn:aws:imagebuilder:...')`` - Use any string (ARN, AMI ID, etc.) - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameter(parameter)`` - Use an SSM parameter object - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameterName('/aws/service/ami/...')`` - Use an SSM parameter by name - ``BaseImage.fromMarketplaceProductId('product-id')`` - Use a Marketplace product ID - ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` - Use an AWS-provided Image Builder image For example ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` would always use the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 in each build. If you want a specific version, you can pass the version as the third parameter. Default: latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, Ubuntu 24.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, latest Windows Server 2022 AMI for Os.WINDOWS
        :param base_docker_image: (experimental) Base image from which Docker runner images will be built. This can be: - A string (ECR/ECR public image URI, DockerHub image, or Image Builder ARN) - deprecated, use BaseContainerImage static factory methods instead - A BaseContainerImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseContainerImage.fromDockerHub('ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use DockerHub - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcr(repo, 'latest')`` - Use ECR (automatically grants permissions with CodeBuild) - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcrPublic('lts', 'ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use ECR Public - ``BaseContainerImage.fromString('public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04')`` - Use any string When using private images from a different account or not on ECR, you may need to include additional setup commands with {@link dockerSetupCommands}. Default: public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:24.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:2 for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019-amd64 for Os.WINDOWS
        :param builder_type: Default: CodeBuild for Linux Docker image, AWS Image Builder for Windows Docker image and any AMI
        :param code_build_options: (experimental) Options specific to CodeBuild image builder. Only used when builderType is RunnerImageBuilderType.CODE_BUILD.
        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
        :param os: (experimental) Image OS. Default: OS.LINUX_UBUNTU
        :param rebuild_interval: (experimental) Schedule the image to be rebuilt every given interval. Useful for keeping the image up-do-date with the latest GitHub runner version and latest OS updates. Set to zero to disable. Default: Duration.days(7)
        :param runner_version: (experimental) Version of GitHub Runners to install. Default: latest version available
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security Groups to assign to this instance.
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Default: no subnet
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

Every job sends a webhook with the labels it's looking for based on runs-on. We match the labels from the webhook with the labels specified here. If all the labels specified here are present in the job's labels, this provider will be chosen and spawn a new runner. Default: ['ec2']
        :param security_group: (deprecated) Security Group to assign to launched runner instances. Default: a new security group
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security groups to assign to launched runner instances. Default: a new security group
        :param spot: (experimental) Use spot instances to save money. Spot instances are cheaper but not always available and can be stopped prematurely. Default: false
        :param spot_max_price: (experimental) Set a maximum price for spot instances. Default: no max price (you will pay current spot price)
        :param storage_options: (experimental) Options for runner instance storage volume.
        :param storage_size: (experimental) Size of volume available for launched runner instances. This modifies the boot volume size and doesn't add any additional volumes. Default: 30GB
        :param subnet: (deprecated) Subnet where the runner instances will be launched. Default: default subnet of account's default VPC

        :param capacity_provider: (experimental) Existing capacity provider to use. Make sure the AMI used by the capacity provider is compatible with ECS. Default: new capacity provider
        :param cluster: (experimental) Existing ECS cluster to use. Default: a new cluster
        :param cpu: (experimental) The number of cpu units used by the task. 1024 units is 1 vCPU. Fractions of a vCPU are supported. Default: 1024
        :param docker_in_docker: (experimental) Support building and running Docker images by enabling Docker-in-Docker (dind) and the required CodeBuild privileged mode. Disabling this can speed up provisioning of CodeBuild runners. If you don't intend on running or building Docker images, disable this for faster start-up times. Default: true
        :param group: (experimental) GitHub Actions runner group name. If specified, the runner will be registered with this group name. Setting a runner group can help managing access to self-hosted runners. It requires a paid GitHub account. The group must exist or the runner will not start. Users will still be able to trigger this runner with the correct labels. But the runner will only be able to run jobs from repos allowed to use the group. Default: undefined
        :param image_builder: (experimental) Runner image builder used to build Docker images containing GitHub Runner and all requirements. The image builder determines the OS and architecture of the runner. Default: EcsRunnerProvider.imageBuilder()

        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Subnets to run the runners in. Default: ECS default
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to launch the runners in. Default: default account VPC
        :param default_labels: (experimental) Add default labels based on OS and architecture of the runner. This will tell GitHub Runner to add default labels like ``self-hosted``, ``linux``, ``x64``, and ``arm64``. Default: true
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH

        You can customize the OS, architecture, VPC, subnet, security groups, etc. by passing in props.

        You can add components to the image builder by calling ``imageBuilder.addComponent()``.

        The default OS is Ubuntu running on x64 architecture.

        Included components:

        - ``RunnerImageComponent.requiredPackages()``
        - ``RunnerImageComponent.runnerUser()``

        :param architecture: (experimental) Image architecture. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param aws_image_builder_options: (experimental) Options specific to AWS Image Builder. Only used when builderType is RunnerImageBuilderType.AWS_IMAGE_BUILDER.
        :param base_ami: (experimental) Base AMI from which runner AMIs will be built. This can be: - A string (AMI ID, Image Builder ARN, SSM parameter reference, or Marketplace product ID) - deprecated, use BaseImage static factory methods instead - A BaseImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseImage.fromAmiId('ami-12345')`` - Use an AMI ID - ``BaseImage.fromString('arn:aws:imagebuilder:...')`` - Use any string (ARN, AMI ID, etc.) - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameter(parameter)`` - Use an SSM parameter object - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameterName('/aws/service/ami/...')`` - Use an SSM parameter by name - ``BaseImage.fromMarketplaceProductId('product-id')`` - Use a Marketplace product ID - ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` - Use an AWS-provided Image Builder image For example ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` would always use the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 in each build. If you want a specific version, you can pass the version as the third parameter. Default: latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, Ubuntu 24.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, latest Windows Server 2022 AMI for Os.WINDOWS
        :param base_docker_image: (experimental) Base image from which Docker runner images will be built. This can be: - A string (ECR/ECR public image URI, DockerHub image, or Image Builder ARN) - deprecated, use BaseContainerImage static factory methods instead - A BaseContainerImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseContainerImage.fromDockerHub('ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use DockerHub - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcr(repo, 'latest')`` - Use ECR (automatically grants permissions with CodeBuild) - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcrPublic('lts', 'ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use ECR Public - ``BaseContainerImage.fromString('public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04')`` - Use any string When using private images from a different account or not on ECR, you may need to include additional setup commands with {@link dockerSetupCommands}. Default: public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:24.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:2 for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019-amd64 for Os.WINDOWS
        :param builder_type: Default: CodeBuild for Linux Docker image, AWS Image Builder for Windows Docker image and any AMI
        :param code_build_options: (experimental) Options specific to CodeBuild image builder. Only used when builderType is RunnerImageBuilderType.CODE_BUILD.
        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
        :param os: (experimental) Image OS. Default: OS.LINUX_UBUNTU
        :param rebuild_interval: (experimental) Schedule the image to be rebuilt every given interval. Useful for keeping the image up-do-date with the latest GitHub runner version and latest OS updates. Set to zero to disable. Default: Duration.days(7)
        :param runner_version: (experimental) Version of GitHub Runners to install. Default: latest version available
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security Groups to assign to this instance.
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Default: no subnet
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        '''(experimental) Properties for EcsRunnerProvider.

        :param default_labels: (experimental) Add default labels based on OS and architecture of the runner. This will tell GitHub Runner to add default labels like ``self-hosted``, ``linux``, ``x64``, and ``arm64``. Default: true
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
        :param retry_options: 
        :param assign_public_ip: (experimental) Assign public IP to the runner task. Make sure the task will have access to GitHub. A public IP might be required unless you have NAT gateway. Default: true
        :param capacity_provider: (experimental) Existing capacity provider to use. Make sure the AMI used by the capacity provider is compatible with ECS. Default: new capacity provider
        :param cluster: (experimental) Existing ECS cluster to use. Default: a new cluster
        :param cpu: (experimental) The number of cpu units used by the task. 1024 units is 1 vCPU. Fractions of a vCPU are supported. Default: 1024
        :param docker_in_docker: (experimental) Support building and running Docker images by enabling Docker-in-Docker (dind) and the required CodeBuild privileged mode. Disabling this can speed up provisioning of CodeBuild runners. If you don't intend on running or building Docker images, disable this for faster start-up times. Default: true
        :param group: (experimental) GitHub Actions runner group name. If specified, the runner will be registered with this group name. Setting a runner group can help managing access to self-hosted runners. It requires a paid GitHub account. The group must exist or the runner will not start. Users will still be able to trigger this runner with the correct labels. But the runner will only be able to run jobs from repos allowed to use the group. Default: undefined
        :param image_builder: (experimental) Runner image builder used to build Docker images containing GitHub Runner and all requirements. The image builder determines the OS and architecture of the runner. Default: EcsRunnerProvider.imageBuilder()
        :param instance_type: (experimental) Instance type of ECS cluster instances. Only used when creating a new cluster. Default: m6i.large or m6g.large
        :param labels: (experimental) GitHub Actions labels used for this provider. These labels are used to identify which provider should spawn a new on-demand runner. Every job sends a webhook with the labels it's looking for based on runs-on. We match the labels from the webhook with the labels specified here. If all the labels specified here are present in the job's labels, this provider will be chosen and spawn a new runner. Default: ['ecs']
        :param max_instances: (experimental) The maximum number of instances to run in the cluster. Only used when creating a new cluster. Default: 5
        :param memory_limit_mib: (experimental) The amount (in MiB) of memory used by the task. Default: 3500, unless ``memoryReservationMiB`` is used and then it's undefined
        :param memory_reservation_mib: (experimental) The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. Default: undefined
        :param min_instances: (experimental) The minimum number of instances to run in the cluster. Only used when creating a new cluster. Default: 0
        :param placement_constraints: (experimental) ECS placement constraints to influence task placement. Example: [ecs.PlacementConstraint.memberOf('ecs-placement')] Default: undefined (no placement constraints)
        :param placement_strategies: (experimental) ECS placement strategies to influence task placement. Example: [ecs.PlacementStrategy.packedByCpu()] Default: undefined (no placement strategies)
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security groups to assign to the task. Default: a new security group
        :param spot: (experimental) Use spot capacity. Default: false (true if spotMaxPrice is specified)
        :param spot_max_price: (experimental) Maximum price for spot instances.
        :param storage_options: (experimental) Options for runner instance storage volume.
        :param storage_size: (experimental) Size of volume available for launched cluster instances. This modifies the boot volume size and doesn't add any additional volumes. Each instance can be used by multiple runners, so make sure there is enough space for all of them. Default: default size for AMI (usually 30GB for Linux and 50GB for Windows)
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Subnets to run the runners in. Default: ECS default
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to launch the runners in. Default: default account VPC

        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH

        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        :param base_ami: (experimental) Base AMI from which runner AMIs will be built. This can be: - A string (AMI ID, Image Builder ARN, SSM parameter reference, or Marketplace product ID) - deprecated, use BaseImage static factory methods instead - A BaseImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseImage.fromAmiId('ami-12345')`` - Use an AMI ID - ``BaseImage.fromString('arn:aws:imagebuilder:...')`` - Use any string (ARN, AMI ID, etc.) - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameter(parameter)`` - Use an SSM parameter object - ``BaseImage.fromSsmParameterName('/aws/service/ami/...')`` - Use an SSM parameter by name - ``BaseImage.fromMarketplaceProductId('product-id')`` - Use a Marketplace product ID - ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` - Use an AWS-provided Image Builder image For example ``BaseImage.fromImageBuilder(scope, 'ubuntu-server-22-lts-x86')`` would always use the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 in each build. If you want a specific version, you can pass the version as the third parameter. Default: latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, Ubuntu 24.04 AMI for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, latest Windows Server 2022 AMI for Os.WINDOWS
        :param base_docker_image: (experimental) Base image from which Docker runner images will be built. This can be: - A string (ECR/ECR public image URI, DockerHub image, or Image Builder ARN) - deprecated, use BaseContainerImage static factory methods instead - A BaseContainerImage instance created using static factory methods: - ``BaseContainerImage.fromDockerHub('ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use DockerHub - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcr(repo, 'latest')`` - Use ECR (automatically grants permissions with CodeBuild) - ``BaseContainerImage.fromEcrPublic('lts', 'ubuntu', '22.04')`` - Use ECR Public - ``BaseContainerImage.fromString('public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04')`` - Use any string When using private images from a different account or not on ECR, you may need to include additional setup commands with {@link dockerSetupCommands}. Default: public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:22.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU and Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2204, public.ecr.aws/lts/ubuntu:24.04 for Os.LINUX_UBUNTU_2404, public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:2 for Os.LINUX_AMAZON_2, mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019-amd64 for Os.WINDOWS
        :param builder_type: Default: CodeBuild for Linux Docker image, AWS Image Builder for Windows Docker image and any AMI
        :param code_build_options: (experimental) Options specific to CodeBuild image builder. Only used when builderType is RunnerImageBuilderType.CODE_BUILD.
        :param components: (experimental) Components to install on the image. Default: none
        :param docker_setup_commands: (experimental) Additional commands to run on the build host before starting the Docker runner image build. Use this to execute commands such as ``docker login`` or ``aws ecr get-login-password`` to pull private base images. Default: []
        :param log_removal_policy: (experimental) Removal policy for logs of image builds. If deployment fails on the custom resource, try setting this to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``. This way the CodeBuild logs can still be viewed, and you can see why the build failed. We try to not leave anything behind when removed. But sometimes a log staying behind is useful. Default: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
        :param os: (experimental) Image OS. Default: OS.LINUX_UBUNTU
        :param rebuild_interval: (experimental) Schedule the image to be rebuilt every given interval. Useful for keeping the image up-do-date with the latest GitHub runner version and latest OS updates. Set to zero to disable. Default: Duration.days(7)
        :param runner_version: (experimental) Version of GitHub Runners to install. Default: latest version available
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security Groups to assign to this instance.
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Default: no subnet
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to build the image in. Default: no VPC
        :param wait_on_deploy: (experimental) Wait for image to finish building during deployment. It's usually best to leave this enabled to ensure everything is ready once deployment is done. However, it can be disabled to speed up deployment in case where you have a lot of image components that can take a long time to build. Disabling this option means a finished deployment is not ready to be used. You will have to wait for the image to finish building before the system can be used. Disabling this option may also mean any changes to settings or components can take up to a week (default rebuild interval) to take effect. Default: true

        :param assign_public_ip: (experimental) Assign public IP to the runner task. Make sure the task will have access to GitHub. A public IP might be required unless you have NAT gateway. Default: true
        :param cluster: (experimental) Existing Fargate cluster to use. Default: a new cluster
        :param cpu: (experimental) The number of cpu units used by the task. For tasks using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of valid values for the memory parameter: 256 (.25 vCPU) - Available memory values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) 512 (.5 vCPU) - Available memory values: 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) 1024 (1 vCPU) - Available memory values: 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) 2048 (2 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) 4096 (4 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) Default: 1024
        :param ephemeral_storage_gib: (experimental) The amount (in GiB) of ephemeral storage to be allocated to the task. The maximum supported value is 200 GiB. NOTE: This parameter is only supported for tasks hosted on AWS Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later. Default: 20
        :param group: (experimental) GitHub Actions runner group name. If specified, the runner will be registered with this group name. Setting a runner group can help managing access to self-hosted runners. It requires a paid GitHub account. The group must exist or the runner will not start. Users will still be able to trigger this runner with the correct labels. But the runner will only be able to run jobs from repos allowed to use the group. Default: undefined
        :param image_builder: (experimental) Runner image builder used to build Docker images containing GitHub Runner and all requirements. The image builder determines the OS and architecture of the runner. Default: FargateRunnerProvider.imageBuilder()
        :param label: (deprecated) GitHub Actions label used for this provider. Default: undefined
        :param labels: (experimental) GitHub Actions labels used for this provider. These labels are used to identify which provider should spawn a new on-demand runner. Every job sends a webhook with the labels it's looking for based on runs-on. We match the labels from the webhook with the labels specified here. If all the labels specified here are present in the job's labels, this provider will be chosen and spawn a new runner. Default: ['fargate']
        :param memory_limit_mib: (experimental) The amount (in MiB) of memory used by the task. For tasks using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of valid values for the cpu parameter: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) - Available cpu values: 256 (.25 vCPU) 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) - Available cpu values: 512 (.5 vCPU) 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available cpu values: 1024 (1 vCPU) Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 2048 (2 vCPU) Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 4096 (4 vCPU) Default: 2048
        :param security_group: (deprecated) Security group to assign to the task. Default: a new security group
        :param security_groups: (experimental) Security groups to assign to the task. Default: a new security group
        :param spot: (experimental) Use Fargate spot capacity provider to save money. - Runners may fail to start due to missing capacity. - Runners might be stopped prematurely with spot pricing. Default: false
        :param subnet_selection: (experimental) Subnets to run the runners in. Default: Fargate default
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC to launch the runners in. Default: default account VPC
        :param default_labels: (experimental) Add default labels based on OS and architecture of the runner. This will tell GitHub Runner to add default labels like ``self-hosted``, ``linux``, ``x64``, and ``arm64``. Default: true
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH
