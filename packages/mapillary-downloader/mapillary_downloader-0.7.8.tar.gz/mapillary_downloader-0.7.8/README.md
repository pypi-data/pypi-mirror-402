# 🗺️ Mapillary Downloader

Download your Mapillary data before it's gone.

## Installation

Installation is optional, you can prefix the command with `uvx` or `pipx` to
download and run it. Or if you're oldskool you can do:

```bash
pip install mapillary-downloader
```

## Usage

First, get your Mapillary API access token from
[the developer dashboard](https://www.mapillary.com/dashboard/developers)

```bash
# Set token via environment variable (recommended)
export MAPILLARY_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
mapillary-downloader USERNAME1 USERNAME2 USERNAME3

# Or pass token directly, and have it in your shell history 💩👀
mapillary-downloader --token YOUR_TOKEN USERNAME1 USERNAME2

# Download to specific directory
mapillary-downloader --output ./downloads USERNAME1
```

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `usernames`     | One or more Mapillary usernames              | (required)         |

The downloader will:

* 🏛️ Check Internet Archive to avoid duplicate downloads
* 📷 Download multiple users' images organized by sequence
* 📜 Inject EXIF metadata (GPS coordinates, camera info, timestamps,
  compass direction)
* 🗜️ Convert to WebP (by default) to save ~70% disk space
* 🛟 Save progress so you can safely resume if interrupted
* 📦 Tar sequence directories (by default) for faster uploads to Internet Archive

## WebP Conversion

You'll need the `cwebp` binary installed:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install webp

# macOS
brew install webp
```

To disable WebP conversion and keep original JPEGs, use `--no-webp`:

```bash
mapillary-downloader --no-webp USERNAME
```

## Tarballs

Images are organized by capture date (YYYY-MM-DD) for incremental archiving:

```
mapillary-username-quality/
  2024-01-15/
    abc123/
      image1.webp
      image2.webp
    bcd456/
      image3.webp
  2024-01-16/
    def789/
      image4.webp
```

By default, these date directories are automatically tarred after download
(resulting in `2024-01-15.tar`, `2024-01-16.tar`, etc.). This date-based
organization enables:

- **Incremental uploads** - Upload each day's tar as soon as it's ready
- **Manageable file counts** - ~365 days/year × 10 years = 3,650 tars max
- **Chronological organization** - Natural sorting and progress tracking

To keep individual files instead of creating tars, use the `--no-tar` flag.

## Internet Archive upload

I've written a bash tool to rip media then tag, queue, and upload to The
Internet Archive. The metadata is in the same format. If you symlink your
`./mapillary_data` dir to `rip`'s `4.ship` dir, they'll be queued for upload.
