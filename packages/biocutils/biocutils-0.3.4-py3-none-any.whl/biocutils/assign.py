    Generic assign that checks if the objects are n-dimensional for n > 1 (i.e.
    has a ``shape`` property of length greater than 1); if so, it calls
    :py:func:`~biocutils.assign_rows.assign_rows` to assign them along the
    first dimension, otherwise it assumes that they are vector-like and calls
    :py:func:`~biocutils.assign_sequence.assign_sequence` instead.

        x:
            Object to be assignted.

    Returns:
        The object after assignment, typically the same type as ``x``.
