    Assign ``replacement`` values to a copy of ``x`` at the rows specified by
    ``indices``. This defaults to creating a deep copy of ``x`` and then
    assigning ``replacement`` to the first dimension of the copy.

    Args:
        x:
            Any high-dimensional object.

        indices:
            Sequence of non-negative integers specifying rows of ``x``.

        replacement:
            Replacement values to be assigned to ``x``. This should have the
            same number of rows as the length of ``indices``. Typically
            ``replacement`` will have the same dimensionality as ``x``.

    Returns:
        A copy of ``x`` with the rows replaced at ``indices``.
