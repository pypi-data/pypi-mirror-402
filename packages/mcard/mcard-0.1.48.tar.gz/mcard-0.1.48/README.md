# MCard

MCard is a local-first, content-addressable storage platform with cryptographic integrity, temporal ordering, and a Polynomial Type Runtime (PTR) that orchestrates polyglot execution. It gives teams a verifiable data backbone without sacrificing developer ergonomics or observability.

---

## Highlights
- 🔐 **Hash-verifiable storage**: Unified network of relationships via SHA-256 hashing across content, handles, and history.
- ♾️ **Universal Substrate**: Emulates the Turing Machine "Infinitely Long Tape" via relational queries for computable DSLs.
- ♻️ **Deterministic execution**: PTR mediates **8 polyglot runtimes** (Python, JavaScript, Rust, C, WASM, Lean, R, Julia).
- 📊 **Enterprise ready**: Structured logging, CI/CD pipeline, security auditing, 99%+ automated test coverage.
- 🧠 **AI-native extensions**: GraphRAG engine, optional LLM runtime, and optimized multimodal vision (`moondream`).
- ⚛️ **Quantum NLP**: Optional `lambeq` + PyTorch integration for pregroup grammar and quantum circuit compilation.
- 🧰 **Developer friendly**: Rich Python API, TypeScript SDK, BMAD-driven TDD workflow, numerous examples.
- 📐 **Algorithm Benchmarks**: Sine comparison (Taylor vs Chebyshev) across Python, C, and Rust.
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized test suite (~37s) with runtime caching and session-scoped fixtures.

For the long-form narrative and chapter roadmap, see **[docs/Narrative_Roadmap.md](docs/Narrative_Roadmap.md)**. Architectural philosophy is captured in **[docs/architecture/Monadic_Duality.md](docs/architecture/Monadic_Duality.md)**.

## Quick Start (Python)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xlp0/MCard_TDD.git
cd MCard_TDD
./activate_venv.sh          # installs uv & dependencies
uv run pytest -q -m "not slow"  # run the fast Python test suite
uv run python -m mcard.ptr.cli run chapters/chapter_01_arithmetic/addition.yaml
```

Create and retrieve a card:
```python
from mcard import MCard, default_collection

card = MCard("Hello MCard")
hash_value = default_collection.add(card)
retrieved = default_collection.get(hash_value)
print(retrieved.get_content(as_text=True))
```

### Quick Start (JavaScript / WASM)
See **[mcard-js/README.md](mcard-js/README.md)** for build, testing, and npm publishing instructions for the TypeScript implementation.

- **mcard-browser**: A standalone browser application using `mcard-js` (depends on `mcard-js` package).

### Quick Start (Quantum NLP)
MCard optionally integrates with **[lambeq](https://cqcl.github.io/lambeq/)** for quantum natural language processing using pregroup grammar:

```bash
# Install with Quantum NLP support (requires Python 3.10+)
uv pip install -e ".[qnlp]"

# Parse a sentence into a pregroup grammar diagram
uv run python scripts/lambeq_web.py "John gave Mary a flower"
```

**Example output** (pregroup types):
```
John: n    gave: n.r @ s @ n.l @ n.l    Mary: n    a flower: n
Result: s (grammatically valid sentence)
```

The pregroup diagrams can be compiled to quantum circuits for QNLP experiments.

## Polyglot Runtime Matrix
| Runtime    | Status | Notes |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| Python     | ✅ | Reference implementation, CLM runner |
| JavaScript | ✅ | Node + browser (WASM) + Full RAG Support + Pyodide |
| Rust       | ✅ | High-performance adapter & WASM target |
| C          | ✅ | Low-level runtime integration |
| WASM       | ✅ | Edge and sandbox execution |
| Lean       | ⚙️ | Formal verification pipeline (requires `lean-toolchain`) |
| R          | ✅ | Statistical computing runtime |
| Julia      | ✅ | High-performance scientific computing |

> **⚠️ Lean Configuration**: A `lean-toolchain` file in the project root is **critical**. Without it, `elan` will attempt to resolve/download toolchain metadata on *every invocation*, causing CLM execution to hang or become unbearably slow.

## Platform Vision (December 2025): The Function Economy

Recent theoretical advancements have crystallized the MCard platform into a **universal substrate for the Function Economy**.

### 1. Vau Calculi Foundation: The MVP Card Database as Function Catalog
Using insights from **John Shutt's Vau Calculi**, PCard treats functions as **first-class operatives** cataloged in the MVP Card database.
- **Identity**: Unique SHA-256 hash
- **Naming**: Mutable handles in `handle_registry`
- **Versioning**: Immutable history in `handle_history`

### 2. Symmetric Monoidal Category: Universal Tooling
All DSL runtimes are isomorphic to **Petri Nets** and **Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMC)**. The **Symmetry Axiom** ($A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A$) guarantees that **one set of tools works for all applications**:
- **O(1) Toolchain**: One debugger, one profiler, one verifier for *all* domains (Finance, Law, Code).
- **Universal Interoperability**: Any CLM can call any other CLM regardless of the underlying runtime (Python, JS, Rust, etc.).

### 3. PKC as Function Engineering Platform
MCard hashes act as **Internet-native URLs for executable functions**.
- **Publish**: Alice (Singapore) creates a function → `sha256:abc...`
- **Resolve**: Bob (New York) resolves `sha256:abc...` → Guaranteed identical function
- **Verify**: Charlie (London) executes with VCard authorization
- **Result**: **$\text{PKC} = \text{GitHub for Executable Functions}$**

## Future Roadmap

### Road to VCard (Design & Implementation)

Based on the **MVP Cards Design Rationale**, a VCard (Value Card) represents a boundary-enforced value exchange unit that often contains sensitive privacy data (identities, private keys, financial claims). Unlike standard MCards which are designed for public distribution and reproducibility, VCards require strict confidentiality.

**Design Requirements & Rationale:**
1.  **Privacy & Encryption**: VCards cannot be stored in the standard `mcard.db` (which is often shared or public) without encryption. They must be stored in a "physically separate" container or be encrypted at rest.
2.  **Authentication Primitive**: A VCard serves as a specialized "Certificate of Authority" — a precondition for executing sensitive PTR actions.
3.  **Audit Certificates**: Execution of a VCard-authorized action must produce a **VerificationVCard** (Certificate of Execution), which proves the action occurred under authorization. This certificate is also sensitive.
4.  **Unified Schema**: While the storage *location* differs, the *data schema* should remain identical to MCard (content addressable, hash-linked) to reuse the rigorous polynomial logic.

**Proposed Architecture:**
*   **Dual-Database Storage**:
    *   `mcard.db` (Public/Shared): Stores standard MCards, Logic (PCards), and Public Keys.
    *   `vcard.db` (Private/Local): Stores VCards, Encrypted Private Keys, and Verification Certificates.
*   **Execution Flow**:
    `execute(pcard_hash, input, vcard_authorization_hash)`
    1.  **Gatekeeper**: PTR checks if `vcard_authorization_hash` exists in the Private Store (`vcard.db`).
    2.  **Zero-Trust Verify**: Runtime validates the VCard's cryptographic integrity and permissions (Security Polynomial).
    3.  **Execute**: If valid, the PCard logic runs.
    4.  **Certify**: A new `VerificationVCard` is generated, signed, and stored in `vcard.db`, linking the Input, Output, and Authority.

**TODOs:**
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Implement `PrivateCollection` (wrapper around `vcard.db`) in Python and JavaScript factories.
- [ ] **Encryption Middleware**: Add a transparent encryption layer (e.g., AES-GCM) for the Private Collection to ensure Encryption-at-Rest.
- [ ] **CLI Auth**: Update `run_clms.py` to accept `--auth <vcard_hash>` and mount the private keystore.
- [ ] **Certificate Generation**: Implement the `VerificationVCard` schema and generation logic in `CLMRunner`.

### Logical Model Certification & Functional Deployment

Use of the **Cubical Logic Model (CLM)** as a "Qualified Logical Model" is strictly governed by principles derived from Eelco Dolstra's *The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model* (the theoretical basis of Nix).

A CLM is not merely source code; it is a candidate for certification. It only becomes a **Qualified Logical Model** when it possesses a valid **Certification**, which is a cryptographic proof of successful execution by a specific version of the Polynomial Type Runtime (PTR).

**The Functional Certification Equation:**
$$
Observation = PTR_{vX.Y.Z}(CLM_{Source})
$$
$$
Certification = Sign_{Authority}(Hash(CLM_{Source}) + Hash(PTR_{vX.Y.Z}) + Hash(Observation))
$$

**Parallels to the Nix Model:**
1.  **Hermetic Inputs**: Just as a Nix derivation hashes all inputs (compiler, libs, source), a CLM Certification depends on the exact **PTR Runtime Version** and **CLM Content Hash**. Changing the runtime version invalidates the certificate, requiring re-qualification (re-execution).
2.  **Deterministic Derivation**: The "build" step is the execution of the CLM's verification logic. If the PTR (the builder) is deterministic, the output (VerificationVCard) is reproducible.
3.  **The "Store"**: The `mcard.db` acts as the Nix Store, holding immutable, content-addressed CLMs. The `vcard.db` acts as the binary cache, holding signed Certifications (outputs) that prove a CLM works for a given runtime configuration.

This ensures that a "Qualified CLM" is not just "code that looks right," but **"code that has logically proven itself"** within a specific, physically identifiable execution environment.
