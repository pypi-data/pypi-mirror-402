# Semantic Validation Rules

Semantic validation happens after loading your yaml. You should expect to see these even if the yaml is validated by the spec.

You can validate any qtype file with:
```
qtype validate you_file.qtype.yaml
```

This document lists all semantic validation rules enforced by QType. These rules are checked after YAML parsing and reference resolution.
