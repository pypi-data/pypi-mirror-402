    "# Constraining Dark Matter Interactions with Gravitational-Wave Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to constrain the interaction strength of three ultralight dark matter (DM) candidates using gravitational-wave strain data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalar Dilaton Dark Matter**\n",
    "- **Dark Photon Dark Matter**\n",
    "- **Tensor Boson Dark Matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "These models leave distinctive imprints on the detector through their interactions with standard-model particles. The detector essentially oscillates at a frequency fixed by the mass of the ultralight dark matter and with an ampiltude that depends on the coupling strength between DM and the standard model. By analyzing the amplitudes of such signals (or upper limits), we can place constraints on the couplings between dark matter and Standard Model fields.\n",

The model introduces a dimensionless coupling strength \\( \\Lambda^{-1} \\), which can be constrained by upper limits on strain."
