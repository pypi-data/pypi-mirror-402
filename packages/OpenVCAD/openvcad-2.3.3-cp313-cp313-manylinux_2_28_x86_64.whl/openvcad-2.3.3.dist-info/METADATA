# OpenVCAD
![Hero Image – Replace with best printed artifact or figure from papers](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/refs/heads/main/images/hero.png)

> Learn more about the OpenVCAD project at <https://matterassembly.org/openvcad>.

OpenVCAD is an open-source volumetric geometry compiler for the design and fabrication of **functionally graded, multi-material** objects.  
It brings advanced **implicit modeling** and **programmable parametric design** into the world of additive manufacturing, enabling designers to create objects with continuous material gradients, lattice structures, and simulation-informed material distributions.

With OpenVCAD, you can:

- Express geometry **and** multi-material composition using **implicit functions**.
- Create complex gradients and digital alloys using **functional material nodes**.
- Design **algorithmically** in Python using `pyvcad` (including in this package) — integrate with NumPy, SciPy, optimization, or simulation workflows.
- Compile directly for **inkjet, FFF, and other AM processes**, with export to slicing and simulation-ready formats.

## Gallery

Here are a few examples of what OpenVCAD can produce:

### Functionally graded lattice
![Example 1 – Functionally graded lattice](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/refs/heads/main/images/lattice_example.png)  
*Multi-material graded lattice structure made with soft, rigid, and non-curing liquid.*

###  Multi-material Stanford Bunny
![Example 2 – Multi-material stanford bunny](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/refs/heads/main/images/bunny_combined.png)  
*(a) OpenVCAD software render of the multi-material lattice-filled Stanford Bunny; (b) physical artifact printed on a Stratasys J750 printer; and (c) close-up view detailing graded internal lattice structures. Strut color is a function of strut length. The bunny is comprised of 3,289 unique struts.*

### Inkjet 3D Printed Medical Scan
![Example 3 – Inkjet 3D Printed Medical Scan](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/refs/heads/main/images/medical.png)  
*Real world patient scan ata processed with OpenVCAD and printed on Inkjet 3D Printer*

## How OpenVCAD Works

1. **Modeling** – Use the `pyvcad` Python package to create a hierarchical tree of geometry + material nodes.
2. **Compilation** – Run an OpenVCAD compiler module to convert the model into volumetric data.
3. **Export** – Output formats include PNG stacks for inkjet printing, FEA meshes for simulation, and meshes for FFF printing.

Key capabilities:

- **Material transitions** – Gradual changes in material properties within one object.
- **Fully implicit representation** – Geometry *and* material are expressed implicitly, scaling to hundreds of billions of voxels.
- **Digital alloying** – Combine materials at a fine scale for intricate compositions.
- **Blending** – Convolution-based smoothing across complex material interfaces.
- **Image-based processing** – Drive material distributions from images (e.g., medical scans).

---
## Getting Started
The code below shows how you can create a basic OpenVCAD design, render it, and export a PNG stack for Inkjet 3D Printing.
```python
# pyvcad is the main library and pyvcad_rendering is the visualization library
import pyvcad as pv
import pyvcad_rendering as viz

# Load some material definitions
materials = pv.default_materials
red = materials.id("red")
blue = materials.id("blue")

# Create a simple rectangular prism as our geometry
# Don't care about material here, we will replace it with a gradient
bar = pv.RectPrism(pv.Vec3(0,0,0), pv.Vec3(100,50,10), red)

# A functional gradient that is 100% blue at x=-50 and 100% at x=50
graded_bar = pv.FGrade(["x/100 + 0.5", "-x/100 + 0.5"],
                       [red, blue], False)
graded_bar.set_child(bar) # Nest the bar inside the gradient to apply the gradient to it

# Render the object, note that this is a blocking call and
# will not continue until the window is closed
viz.Render(graded_bar, materials)

# Export the object for 3D printing or simulation.
# This brings up a wizard to guide you through the export process
viz.Export(graded_bar, materials)
```

## What OpenVCAD **Is Not**

OpenVCAD is **not** a voxel-by-voxel design tool. While it can emit voxel data, design is done implicitly with high-level math expressions that scale to extremely large builds (e.g. Inkjet 3D printing).
