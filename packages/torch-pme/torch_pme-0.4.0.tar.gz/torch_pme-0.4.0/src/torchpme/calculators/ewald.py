class EwaldCalculator(Calculator):
    r"""
    Potential computed using the Ewald sum.

    Scaling as :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2)` with respect to the number of particles
    :math:`N`.

    For getting reasonable values for the ``smearing`` of the potential class and  the
    ``lr_wavelength`` based on a given accuracy for a specific structure you should use
    :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_ewald`. This function will also find the optimal
    ``cutoff`` for the  **neighborlist**.

    .. hint::

        For a training exercise it is recommended only run a tuning procedure with
        :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_ewald` for the largest system in your dataset.

    For a :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^{1.5})` scaling, one can set the parameters as following:

    .. math::

        \mathrm{smearing} &= 1.3 \cdot N^{1 / 6} / \sqrt{2}

        \mathrm{lr\_wavelength} &= 2 \pi \cdot \mathrm{smearing} / 2.2

        \mathrm{r_c} &= 2.2 \cdot \mathrm{smearing}

    where :math:`N` is the number of particles. The magic numbers :math:`1.3` and
    :math:`2.2` above result from tests on a CsCl system, whose unit cell is repeated 16
    times in each direction, resulting in a system of 8192 atoms.

    :param potential: the two-body potential that should be computed, implemented
        as a :class:`torchpme.potentials.Potential` object. The ``smearing`` parameter
        of the potential determines the split between real and k-space regions.
        For a :class:`torchpme.CoulombPotential` it corresponds to the
        width of the atom-centered Gaussian used to split the Coulomb potential
        into the short- and long-range parts. A reasonable value for
        most systems is to set it to ``1/5`` times the neighbor list cutoff.
    :param lr_wavelength: Spatial resolution used for the long-range (reciprocal space)
        part of the Ewald sum. More concretely, all Fourier space vectors with a
        wavelength >= this value will be kept. If not set to a global value, it will be
        set to half the smearing parameter to ensure convergence of the
        long-range part to a relative precision of 1e-5.
    :param full_neighbor_list: If set to :obj:`True`, a "full" neighbor list is
        expected as input. This means that each atom pair appears twice. If set to
        :obj:`False`, a "half" neighbor list is expected.
    :param prefactor: electrostatics prefactor; see :ref:`prefactors` for details and
        common values.
