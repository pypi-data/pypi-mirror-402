    Base calculator for the torch interface. Based on a

    a local part computed in real space, and a long-range part computed
    in the Fourier domain. The class can be used directly to evaluate
    the real-space part of the potential, or subclassed providing
    a strategy to evalate the long-range contribution in k-space
    (see e.g. :class:`PMECalculator` or :class:`EwaldCalculator`).

    :func:`Calculator._compute_kspace`.

        It is calculated as

        .. math::

            V_i = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} q_j\,v(r_{ij})

        and :math:`q_j` are atomic "charges" (corresponding to the electrostatic charge
        when using a Coulomb potential).

        only the real-space part of the potential. Otherwise, provided that the

            ``n_channels = 1``. If more than one "channel" is provided multiple
            potentials for the same position are computed depending on the charges and
            the potentials.

            coordinates of the ``N`` particles within the supercell.

            which the potential should be computed in real space.
        :param neighbor_distances: torch.tensor with the pair distances of the neighbors
            for which the potential should be computed in real space.
        :param periodic: optional torch.tensor of shape ``(3,)`` indicating which
            directions are periodic (True) and which are not (False). If not
            provided, full periodicity is assumed.
        :param node_mask: Optional torch.tensor of shape ``(len(positions),)`` that
            indicates which of the atoms are masked.
        :param pair_mask: Optional torch.tensor containing a mask to be applied to the
            result.
        :param kvectors: Optional precomputed k-vectors to be used in the Fourier
