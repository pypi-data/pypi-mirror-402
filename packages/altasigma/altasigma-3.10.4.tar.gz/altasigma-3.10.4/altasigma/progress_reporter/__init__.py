Progress Reporting Module

This module provides utilities for tracking and reporting progress in multi-step
processing tasks. It implements a structured approach to progress reporting
that includes step definitions, step activation/completion, and failure handling.

The progress reporting uses JSON-formatted messages printed to stdout, which can
be captured and processed by the Orchestration.
