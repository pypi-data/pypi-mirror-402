def get_dominant_topics(W, min_score=0.0, s_matrix=None, H=None):
    """
    Get the dominant topic for each document, filtering out zero-score documents.
    Supports both standard NMF and NMTF models.

    This function addresses the issue where np.argmax() assigns documents with all zero
    topic scores to topic 0 (Topic 1), which creates misleading visualizations and analysis.

    For NMTF models, this function uses the NMF-Equivalent Method where document clusters
    are treated as primary topics. The H matrix transformation (H' = S @ H) should be
    applied upstream before calling this function. After transformation, NMTF works exactly
    like standard NMF.

    Args:
        W (numpy.ndarray): Document-topic matrix with shape (n_documents, n_topics).
                          Each row represents a document, each column represents a topic.
                          For NMTF, W represents document clusters directly.
        min_score (float, optional): Minimum score threshold for a valid topic assignment.
                                    Documents with max score <= min_score are marked as -1.
                                    Default is 0.0.
        s_matrix (numpy.ndarray, optional): Deprecated. No longer used. The S matrix
                                           transformation should be applied to H upstream.
                                           Kept for backward compatibility.
        H (numpy.ndarray, optional): Deprecated. No longer used. Kept for backward compatibility.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Array of dominant topic indices with shape (n_documents,).
                      Values range from 0 to n_topics-1 for valid assignments,
                      or -1 for documents with no significant topic scores.

    Example:
        >>> W = np.array([[0.5, 0.3, 0.2],    # Doc 0 -> Topic 0
        ...               [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],    # Doc 1 -> -1 (no topic)
        ...               [0.1, 0.8, 0.1]])   # Doc 2 -> Topic 1
        >>> get_dominant_topics(W)
        array([ 0, -1,  1])

    Note:
        - Documents with all zero scores are assigned -1 (no dominant topic)
        - Visualizations should filter out documents with topic index -1
        - For NMTF, ensure H' = S @ H transformation is applied before topic extraction
        - This prevents polluting topic distributions with meaningless assignments
