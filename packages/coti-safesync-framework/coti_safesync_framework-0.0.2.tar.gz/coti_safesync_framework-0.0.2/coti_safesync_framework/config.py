@dataclass
class QueueConfig:
    """Configuration for Redis Streams queue operations.
    This configuration applies to a single QueueConsumer instance
    (typically one worker process/thread).
    
    Attributes:
        stream_key: Redis stream key/name where messages are stored and read from.
        consumer_group: Consumer group name for coordinating message consumption.
            - Consumers within the same group share work (load-balancing).
            - Different consumer groups on the same stream operate independently and
              each receive all messages (fan-out).
        consumer_name: Unique name identifying this consumer within the consumer group.
            Used by Redis to track pending messages per-consumer.
        claim_idle_ms: Minimum idle time in milliseconds before a pending message is
            considered stale and eligible for claiming via XCLAIM.
            (Redis defines idle time as "time since last delivery".)
            Default: 60,000 ms (60 seconds).
        block_ms: Maximum time in milliseconds to block in XREADGROUP when no messages
            are available. Must be > 0 (Redis interprets 0 as infinite blocking).
            Default: 5,000 ms (5 seconds).
        max_read_count: Advisory maximum number of messages to read per XREADGROUP call.
            Higher values improve throughput but return larger batches.
            Default: 1.
        claim_skip_own_messages: If True, claim_stale() will skip messages already owned
            by this consumer. If False (default), claim_stale() can reclaim messages from
            any consumer including self, enabling retry workers to retry their own failed
            messages. Default: False.
