### Installation for developers

#### Prerequisites for Windows

Before installing MRseq with development dependencies on Windows, you need:

1. **Visual Studio Build Tools**: The MRzeroCore dependency requires Rust compilation with Microsoft Visual C++ linker
   - Download "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022" from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   - During installation, select the "C++ build tools" workload
   - Ensure "Windows 10/11 SDK" is included
   - This is required for compiling native Rust extensions

2. **Rust toolchain** (automatically installed by MRzeroCore if not present)

#### Installation steps

1. Clone the MRseq repository
2. Create/select a python environment
3. Install "MRseq" in editable mode including test dependencies: ``` pip install -e ".[dev]" ```
4. Setup pre-commit hook: ``` pre-commit install ```
