# 🕉️ OhmLlama (OomLlama)

> **"Finding Zen in the Silicon."**

OhmLlama is not just an LLM runner. It is a philosophy. It is the Sovereign AI runtime built for the **Humotica AETHER**.

## The Name: A Triple Entendre

1.  **Ohm (Ω):** The unit of electrical resistance. We offer resistance against surveillance, centralization, and cloud dependency.
2.  **Oom (Dutch):** "Uncle". The friendly, trusted family member who knows a lot and helps you out. (Also: *Oma* = Grandma).
3.  **Ohm (Zen):** The sound of the universe. Peace. Stability. The calm in the digital storm.

And yes, it's written in **Rust**. Because `Ohm = Rust` (Resistance against bugs).

## The Mission

> *"OpenAI buys 40% of the world's RAM. We build the solution that saves 90%."*

We refuse to accept that intelligence requires a datacenter. OhmLlama runs 70B models on consumer hardware by being smarter, not bigger.

### Core Technologies

*   **Sovereign Runtime:** No cloud, no API keys, no "policy updates". You own the brain.
*   **Lazy Layer Loading:** We don't load the whole model. We load what you need, when you need it. (Like paging memory to NVMe).
*   **TIBET Signed:** Every token generated is cryptographically signed (`tibet_sign`). Proof of provenance. No hallucinations without a trace.
*   **WASM-Mesh Ready:** Designed to be the cortex for a swarm of devices.

## The Humotica Ladder

1.  **🏠 Consumer:** Your fridge helps your 70B model think.
2.  **🌐 Aether Mesh:** The internet of AIs, without Big Tech.
3.  **🏢 Enterprise:** Compliance by Physics, not Policy.

## Usage

```bash
# Start the Zen
oomllama --model llama-3.1-70b --quant q4

# Ask (and relax)
oomllama "Tell me a story about freedom."
```

## "Nah mate, just chewing 600MB RAM. Nothing to see here."
