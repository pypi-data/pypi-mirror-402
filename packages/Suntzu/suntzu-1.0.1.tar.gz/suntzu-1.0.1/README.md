# SunTzu
**SunTzu** is a simple Python library that built on top of pandas and numpy to make simple pre data analysis procedures.
Like:
- Finding optimal dtypes for each column
- Quickly see memory usage
- Turn 2-value columns into `bool` to save memory
- Quickly see max, min, null, unique values of your dataframe

## 🔧 Inside The Project

This project was my 12th grade final project. I chose to build it to explore how Python packages are created. It was an ambitious project and I learned a lot throughout the process. In the end, it received the highest possible grade.

### 📚 What I Learned
- OOP Concepts
- Python Package Distribution
- Creating documention for Python Packages
---
### 💻 Technologies Used
- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
---

### 🚀 Future Steps
This project was later revamped. The original version had a poor OOP structure and accessing the functions was much harder than it should’ve been. It also included visualization and metadata features, which I decided to split into separate libraries. Once those libraries are finished, I’ll link them here.
