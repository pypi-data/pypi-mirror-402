## I want to run the upgrader...

### On my local data

```python
from aind_metadata_upgrader.upgrade import Upgrade

# <Your code here: load your data as a dictionary, e.g. json.load(f)>

upgraded_record = Upgrade(data)
upgraded_record.save()
```

### On a single record in V1 DocDB

```python
from aind_metadata_upgrader.sync import run_one
run_one(record_id="<docdb_id>")
```

### On all records in V1 DocDB

```python
from aind_metadata_upgrader.sync import run
run()
```

## I want to develop new upgraders

Add a new `CoreUpgrader` class, then include it in the `MAPPINGS` object.
