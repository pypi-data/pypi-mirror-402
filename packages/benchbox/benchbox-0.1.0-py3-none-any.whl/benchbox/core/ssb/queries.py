Provides functionality to load and parameterize the 13 standard SSB queries, which are organized into 4 flights:

Flight 1 (Q1.1-Q1.3): Drill-down queries
Flight 2 (Q2.1-Q2.3): Drill-down queries with joins
Flight 3 (Q3.1-Q3.4): Drill-down queries with multiple joins
Flight 4 (Q4.1-Q4.3): Join queries with aggregation
