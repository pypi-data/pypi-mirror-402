"""CoffeeShop query manager for the reference-aligned schema.

The query set has been rewritten to operate solely on the canonical
``dim_locations``, ``dim_products``, and ``order_lines`` tables emitted by the
new generator. Queries emphasise sales performance, regional trends, product
mix, and pricing behaviour—mirroring typical analytics performed on the
reference dataset.
