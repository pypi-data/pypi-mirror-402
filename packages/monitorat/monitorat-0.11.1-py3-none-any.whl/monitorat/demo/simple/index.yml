      ### Metrics Widget

      Metrics provides an overview of system performance, including CPU,
      memory, disk, network usage, and temperature over time. Continuous
      data is logged to `metrics.csv`; snapshots of tile data are
      applied on each page refresh. Battery usage is also available for
      laptop users.

      ### Network Widget

      The Network widget tracks uptime and outages based on a ddclient-
      style log file. This demo uses a synthetic `network.log` file
      generated by `demo/setup.py --demo`.

      #### Log format
      ```
      MMM DD HH:MM:SS <host> <process>: INFO:    [example.com]> detected IPv4 address 10.0.0.1
      MMM DD HH:MM:SS <host> <process>: FAILED:  [example.com]> updating example.com: nohost: unable to resolve current IP
      ```

      This example is limited to seven days.
