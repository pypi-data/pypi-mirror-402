# _Sourcery_ Command Line Interface

## Installation and usage

### Installation

_Sourcery_ command line interface can be installed by running:

```
pip install sourcery

You can also log in via providing your token:

## Usage

`sourcery review` command:

```

To apply the changes suggested by Sourcery, use the `--fix` option:

## Command Line Options

_Sourcery_ provides a few options for running. You can list them by running
`sourcery review --help`

```
sourcery review --help

```

## Configuration

_Sourcery_ reads configuration settings from `.sourcery.yaml` in the project
directory. Full details are described
[here](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Configuration/).

## Pre-commit Hook

_Sourcery_ works great with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). Once you
[have it installed](https://pre-commit.com/#install), add this to the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/sourcery-ai/sourcery
      rev: v1.40.1.dev0
      hooks:
          - id: sourcery
            # The best way to use Sourcery in a pre-commit hook:
            # * review only changed lines:
            # * omit the summary
            args: [--diff=git diff HEAD, --no-summary]
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

To review all changes compared to the `main` branch:

```yaml
args: [--diff=git diff main]
```

If you want Sourcery to automatically apply the suggested changes,add the
`--fix` option:

```yaml
args: [--diff=git diff HEAD, --fix]
```

If Sourcery is the first pre-commit hook that you've added to your project,
you'll also need to run `pre-commit install`.

## Continuous Integration

For the majority of projects, the best usage of Sourcery in the CI is to review
only the code of the current PR.

You can use the script below to detect Sourcery violations that are present in
the current code but not in the `main` branch:

```bash
pip install sourcery
# Store your Sourcery token as a secret in your CI environment.
sourcery login --token $SOURCERY_TOKEN
sourcery review --diff "git diff main" .
```

Instead of `main`, you can pick another branch as well. For example, in GitHub
Actions you can use
`--diff="git diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}"`
