  explanation: |
    Avoid complex code, like loops, in test functions.

    Google's software engineering guidelines says:
    "Clear tests are trivially correct upon inspection"
    To reach that avoid complex code in tests:
    * loops
    * conditionals

    Some ways to fix this:

    * Use parametrized tests to get rid of the loop.
    * Move the complex logic into helpers.
    * Move the complex part into pytest fixtures.

    > Complexity is most often introduced in the form of logic. Logic is defined via the imperative parts of programming languages such as operators, loops, and conditionals. When a piece of code contains logic, you need to do a bit of mental computation to determine its result instead of just reading it off of the screen. It doesn't take much logic to make a test more difficult to reason about.

  explanation: |
    Don't import test modules.

    Tests should be self-contained and don't depend on each other.

    If a helper function is used by multiple tests,
    define it in a helper module,
    instead of importing one test from the other.
  tests:
  - match: import test.unit.test_something
  - match: from test.unit.test_something import custom_helper
  - match: from test.unit.test_something import test_basic
  - match: from test.unit.test_something import FakeDb
  - no-match: import test.unit.helper
  - no-match: from test_something.unit.helpers import custom_helper
