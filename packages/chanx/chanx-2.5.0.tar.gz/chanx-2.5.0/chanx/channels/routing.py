"""
URL routing utilities for Django Channels applications.

This module provides include, path and re_path functions specifically designed for
Django Channels WebSocket and ASGI application routing. These functions create
URLRouter instances for organizing WebSocket consumers and other ASGI applications.

Functions:
    include: Include router from another module for Channels routing.
             Similar to Django's URL include function, but designed for Channels routing.
             Allows for modular organization of WebSocket routing configurations.

    path: Creates a URLRouter for the given route with simplified syntax.
          Specifically designed for Channels consumers and ASGI applications.

    re_path: Creates a URLRouter for the given route using regular expressions.
             Specifically designed for Channels consumers and ASGI applications.

This module is intended for WebSocket and ASGI routing only. For HTTP routing,
use Django's standard django.urls module.

    Similar to Django's URL include function, but designed for Channels routing.
    This allows for modular organization of WebSocket routing configurations.

    This function can handle:

    - A URLRouter instance (returned as-is)
    - A string path to a module with a 'router' attribute
    - A module object with a 'router' attribute

    The 'router' attribute should be a URLRouter instance.

    Args:
        arg: Either a URLRouter instance, a string path to a module, or the module itself.
             For string paths or modules, they should have a 'router' attribute.
