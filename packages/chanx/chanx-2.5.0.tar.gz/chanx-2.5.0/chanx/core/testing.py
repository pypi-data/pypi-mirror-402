"""
Core WebSocket testing utilities for Chanx.

This module provides fundamental testing infrastructure for WebSocket consumers,
including an enhanced WebsocketCommunicator mixin with structured message handling,
automatic message collection, completion signal tracking, and message validation.

The mixin provides framework-agnostic testing functionality that can be combined
with framework-specific WebSocket communicator implementations (Django Channels,
fast-channels, etc.) to create concrete testing utilities.

    Mixin providing enhanced WebSocket testing functionality for Chanx consumers.

    This mixin provides Chanx-specific features that work across different WebSocket
    frameworks (Django Channels, fast-channels, etc.):

    - Structured message sending and receiving with BaseMessage objects
    - Automatic message collection until completion signals
    - Message validation using consumer's type adapters
    - Connection state tracking
    - Async context manager support for automatic cleanup

    Key methods:

    - send_message(): Send BaseMessage objects directly
    - receive_all_json(): Collect all messages until timeout
    - receive_all_messages(): Collect and validate messages until stop action
    - connect()/disconnect(): Enhanced connection management

    The mixin automatically handles message serialization/deserialization and integrates
    with Chanx's completion signal system for reliable testing.

    Concrete implementations should inherit from both this mixin and a framework-specific
    WebSocket communicator class (e.g., channels.testing.WebsocketCommunicator).
