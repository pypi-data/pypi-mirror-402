# Semantic PR Title Validation
#
# This workflow validates PR titles follow conventional commit format and applies
# labels automatically based on the title.
#
# Jobs:
# 1. validate-pr-title - Ensures PR titles follow semantic format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
# 2. autolabel - Uses Release Drafter's autolabeler to apply labels based on title
#    (e.g., "feat:" -> enhancement -> minor, "fix:" -> bug -> patch)
#
# Note: The autolabeler uses the same release-drafter.yml config but only applies
# labels when triggered from PR events (it doesn't create/update draft releases).
