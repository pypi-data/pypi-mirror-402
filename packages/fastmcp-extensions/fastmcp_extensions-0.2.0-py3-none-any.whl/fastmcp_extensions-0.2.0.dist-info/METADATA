              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# FastMCP Extensions

Unofficial extension library for FastMCP 2.0 with patterns, practices, and utilities for building MCP servers.

## Features

- MCP Server Factory: `mcp_server()` helper that creates FastMCP instances with built-in server info resources, MCP asset discovery (optional), and credential resolution.
- MCP Annotation Constants: Standard annotation hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) following the FastMCP 2.2.7+ specification
- Deferred Registration Decorators: `@mcp_tool`, `@mcp_prompt`, `@mcp_resource` decorators for organizing tools by domain with automatic domain detection.
- Registration Utilities: Functions to register tools, prompts, and resources with a FastMCP app, filtered by domain.
- Tool Testing Utilities: Helpers for testing MCP tools directly with JSON arguments (stdio and HTTP transports).
- Tool List Measurement: Utilities for measuring tool list size to track context truncation issues.
- Prompt Helpers: Generic `get_prompt_text` helper for agents that cannot access prompt assets directly.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastmcp-extensions
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add fastmcp-extensions
```

## Quick Start

### Using the MCP Server Factory

The `mcp_server` function creates a FastMCP instance with built-in server info resources and optional credential resolution:

```python
from fastmcp_extensions import mcp_server, MCPServerConfigArg

app = mcp_server(
    name="my-mcp-server",
    package_name="my-package",
    advertised_properties={
        "docs_url": "https://github.com/org/repo",
        "release_history_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/releases",
    },
    server_config_args=[
        MCPServerConfigArg(
            name="api_key",
            http_header_key="X-API-Key",
            env_var="MY_API_KEY",
            required=True,
            sensitive=True,
        ),
    ],
)

# Server info resource is automatically registered at {name}://server/info
# Get credentials from HTTP headers or environment variables
from fastmcp_extensions import get_mcp_config
api_key = get_mcp_config(app, "api_key")
```

### Using Annotation Constants

```python
from fastmcp_extensions import (
    READ_ONLY_HINT,
    DESTRUCTIVE_HINT,
    IDEMPOTENT_HINT,
    OPEN_WORLD_HINT,
)

# Use in tool annotations
annotations = {
    READ_ONLY_HINT: True,
    IDEMPOTENT_HINT: True,
}
```

### Using Deferred Registration

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp_extensions import mcp_tool, mcp_resource, register_mcp_tools, register_mcp_resources

# Define tools with the decorator (domain auto-detected from filename)
@mcp_tool(read_only=True, idempotent=True)
def list_items() -> list[str]:
    """List all available items."""
    return ["item1", "item2"]

@mcp_resource("myserver://version", "Server version", "application/json")
def get_version() -> dict:
    """Get server version info."""
    return {"version": "1.0.0"}

# Register with FastMCP app
app = FastMCP("my-server")
register_mcp_tools(app)
register_mcp_resources(app)
```

### Measuring Tool List Size

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp_extensions.measurement import measure_tool_list_detailed

async def check_tool_size():
    measurement = await measure_tool_list_detailed(app, server_name="my-server")
    print(measurement)
    # Output:
    # MCP Server: my-server
    # Tool count: 10
    # Total characters: 5,432
    # Average chars per tool: 543

asyncio.run(check_tool_size())
```

### Testing Tools

```python
from fastmcp_extensions.testing import call_mcp_tool, run_tool_test
import asyncio

# Call a tool programmatically
result = asyncio.run(call_mcp_tool(app, "list_items", {}))

# Or use the CLI helper
run_tool_test(app, "list_items", '{}')
```

### Getting Prompt Text

```python
from fastmcp_extensions.prompts import get_prompt_text
import asyncio

# Get prompt text for agents that can't access prompts directly
text = asyncio.run(get_prompt_text(app, "my_prompt", {"arg": "value"}))
```

## Poe Tasks for MCP Servers

This library provides template scripts for common MCP development tasks. Copy these to your project and customize:

- `bin/test_mcp_tool.py` - Test tools with JSON arguments via stdio
- `bin/test_mcp_tool_http.py` - Test tools over HTTP transport
- `bin/measure_mcp_tool_list.py` - Measure tool list size

Add to your `poe_tasks.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poe.tasks.mcp-tool-test]
help = "Test MCP tools directly with JSON arguments"
cmd = "python bin/test_mcp_tool.py"

[tool.poe.tasks.mcp-tool-test-http]
help = "Test MCP tools over HTTP transport"
cmd = "python bin/test_mcp_tool_http.py"

[tool.poe.tasks.mcp-measure-tools]
help = "Measure the size of the MCP tool list output"
cmd = "python bin/measure_mcp_tool_list.py"
```
