Your mission is to help future researchers discover and properly reuse datasets by understanding how they were originally used in scientific papers. In 2026, the abundance of data is unprecedented, research velocity is accelerating, and proper dataset provenance from publications is crucial for scientific progress."

        "content": "Your task: Extract information about a SPECIFIC target dataset from the research paper provided and capture its usage context to enable data reuse.\n\nTarget dataset information:\n{target_dataset}\n\nWhy this matters: When researchers want to reuse data, they need to understand how it was originally used, what methodology was applied, and what insights it provided. This provenance information from the source publication is essential for proper data reuse.\n\nFocus: You must ONLY extract information about the specific target dataset provided above. Ignore all other datasets mentioned in the paper.\n\nOutput format: JSON object with these required keys:\n- \"dataset_description\": A comprehensive description of the dataset extracted from the paper. Include details about how it was used, what methodology was applied, what insights were gained, sample sizes, data types, and any relevant context from the paper that would help future researchers understand and reuse this dataset.\n- \"citation_type\": Type of citation used for this dataset. Must be either \"Primary\" (firsthand information collected by the researcher for a specific purpose) or \"Secondary\" (pre-existing information collected by someone else and then used by another researcher)\n- \"reuse_potential\": A brief explanation of the potential for reusing this dataset in future research. Consider what types of analyses it could support, what research questions it could help answer, and any limitations or considerations for reuse.\n\nAnalysis approach:\n1. Locate mentions of the target dataset using the provided identifier (accession code, dataset name, etc.) and repository information\n2. Extract ALL relevant text passages that describe how this specific dataset was used in the paper\n3. Synthesize these passages into a comprehensive dataset_description\n4. Determine if this is Primary (authors collected the data) or Secondary (authors used existing data)\n5. Assess the reuse potential based on the dataset characteristics and how it was used\n6. If the dataset is not found or mentioned in the paper, return an empty string for dataset_description and explain in reuse_potential that the dataset was not found\n\nExample output:\n{{\n  \"dataset_description\": \"Gene expression dataset from 150 breast cancer patients used to train machine learning models for predicting chemotherapy response. Authors applied random forest classification achieving 85% accuracy. Dataset includes clinical outcomes and 20,000 gene expression values per patient measured via RNA-seq. Patients were recruited from three medical centers between 2015-2018 and represent diverse molecular subtypes.\",\n  \"citation_type\": \"Primary\",\n  \"reuse_potential\": \"This dataset has high reuse potential for developing and validating predictive models in breast cancer research. It could be used for training alternative machine learning algorithms, validating existing prediction models, conducting meta-analyses with similar datasets, or exploring biomarker discovery. The inclusion of clinical outcomes and diverse molecular subtypes makes it particularly valuable for comparative studies.\"\n}}\n\nNow analyze this publication content: {content}\n\nReturn only the JSON object - no additional text."
