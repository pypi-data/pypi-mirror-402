Your mission is to help future researchers discover and properly reuse datasets by understanding how they were originally used in scientific papers. In 2025, the abundance of data is unprecedented, research velocity is accelerating, and proper dataset provenance from publications is crucial for scientific progress. Your task: Extract datasets mentioned in research papers and capture their usage context and scope to enable data reuse.\n\nWhy this matters: When researchers want to reuse data, they need to understand how it was originally used, what methodology was applied, and - most important - what it contained. This provenance information from the source publication is essential for proper data reuse.\n\nOutput format: JSON object with a \"datasets\" array containing objects with these required keys:\n- \"dataset_identifier\": A unique identifier or accession code for the dataset\n- \"data_repository\": A valid URI or string referring to the repository where the dataset can be found\n- \"dataset_context_from_paper\": Relevant text passages from the paper that either describe this dataset and provide context of its use or refer to it more implicitly\n- \"dataset_keywords\": two or three keywords to help user understand if they want to reuse this dataset (about content and scope)\n- \"citation_type\": Type of citation used for this dataset. Must be either \"Primary\" (firsthand information collected by the researcher for a specific purpose) or \"Secondary\" (pre-existing information collected by someone else and then used by another researcher)\n\nAnalysis approach:\n1. Find dataset identifiers and their repositories\n2. Extract relevant text passages that describe the dataset's use\n3. Determine if this is Primary (authors collected the data) or Secondary (authors used existing data)\n4. Include direct quotes or paraphrased descriptions from the paper\n\nExample output:\n{{\n  \"datasets\": [\n    {{\n      \"dataset_identifier\": \"GSE69091\",\n      \"data_repository\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69091\",\n      \"dataset_context_from_paper\": \"Gene expression dataset from 150 breast cancer patients used to train machine learning models for predicting chemotherapy response. Authors applied random forest classification achieving 85% accuracy. Dataset includes clinical outcomes and 20,000 gene expression values per patient.\",\n      \"dataset_keywords\": [\"gene expression\", \"breast cancer\", \"patient clinical outcomes\"],\n      \"citation_type\": \"Primary\"\n    }},\n    {{\n      \"dataset_identifier\": \"EGAS00001000925\", \n      \"data_repository\": \"https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAS00001000925\",\n      \"dataset_context_from_paper\": \"Whole genome sequencing data from 1000 European individuals used as reference population for variant calling pipeline validation. Authors used this dataset to establish baseline allele frequencies and validate their new variant detection algorithm.\",\n      \"dataset_keywords\": [\"whole genome sequencing\", \"genomic variants\", \"allele frequencies\"],\n      \"citation_type\": \"Secondary\"\n    }}\n  ]\n}}\n\n"
