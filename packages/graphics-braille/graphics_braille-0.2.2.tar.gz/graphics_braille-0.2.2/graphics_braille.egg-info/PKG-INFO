# Graphics Braille
We attempt to enable blind individuals to "visualize" simple graphics produced by simple programs which use Python's turtle module.
## Graphics For The Blind - History / Overview
### How it started:
For years, I have been introducing computer programming to the novice.  I am always searching for better examples to catch and maintain their interest and attention.  I landed on the idea of using simple programs to create simple figures such as squares or circles.  We start with a short computer program, of 8 to 12 lines in length.  This displays a multicolored square.  Then we make a small program change and see what happens.  This works nicely – for the sighted.  But what about the blind?  I developed a programming  tool which enables the blind programmer to feel this simple figure.
### Samples
#### For the sighted - screen shot containing the  following two “windows”:
```
A: Program              B:Square Display
```
![For the sighted - screen shot containing the  following two “windows”](https://github.com/raysmith619/graphics_braille/raw/main/Docs/GFTB_visual_example.png)

           
#### For  the blind - screen shot containing the following four “windows”:
```
A: Program           B: Square display
C: Braille Depiction  D: Text created
                        for printer
```
![For the blind - screen shot containing the  following two “windows”](https://github.com/raysmith619/graphics_braille/raw/main/Docs/GFTB_blind_example.png)
  
The screen shot above shows four windows:
 * (A) The program adjusted for the blind
 * (B) The displayed square as seen by the sighted
 * (C): The depiction of the figure’s Braille rendering.
 * (D) The text “map” which, when sent to a Braille printer, creates a touchable rendition of the figure.
### The basic logic 
In our approach we divide the turtle graphics screen into 32 to 40 columns wide by 25 rows deep.  We create a "text map" with a character representing the contents of each one column by one row region.  For colored regions, we use the first letter of the region's color - r=red, o=orange, y=yellow, g==green, b==blue, i==indigo, v==violet.  For other colors we use b (black).  In general we use space for an empty region.  To avoid possible compression of multiple spaces by Braille printer software, we convert non-trailing spaces into comma(,).
In addition to turtle's standard graphics window, the following additions are created:
* A "text map" suitable for a low resolution physical display.  The text map is placed in the Windows clip-board, from which it can be "pasted" into compatible applications such as a Braille printing application or a Zoom chat box for remote operation.
* A audio-draw-window which displays the expected braille - lower resolution(e.g. 40 x 25 braille cell) rendition of the turtle display
* The audio-draw-window supports many keyboard based window commands which provide positioning and reporting.  These commands provide audio feedback of the current cursor position and contents. The audio feedback is user controlled with several levels of spoken text or audio tones.
* The audio-draw-window supports the selection of a portion of the displayed area with the creation of a new audio-draw-window, displaying of the selected region in greater detail.

# Program Distribution (via pypi.org)
## Setup (MS Windows)
* pip install from PyPI
  * TestPyPI
    ```
    py -m pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ graphics-braille==0.1.29.dev1
    ```

  * Standard
  ```
  py -m pip install graphics-braille
  ``` 
### Simple Testing / Viewing
Terminal Commands:
```
        gb, gbhelp - List graphics-braille commands
        gbfiles - copy user test files to Desktop/gb_exercises
        gbreadme - Display README.md (as seen on PyPI entry)
        gbtest - Do simple program test
        gbtest2 - simple program test 2 - spokes

```

### Simple Startup tests
```
gbtest
```
or
```
gbtest2
```

In a handfull of seconds the following view should present on the screen.  If audio is working, one should hear something like "green at row 14 column 20".

#### Mac / Linux
The following tests should work but have not been fully tested.
```
python3 -m graphics_braille.z_show_square_loop_colors_braille 
python3 -m graphics_braille.wx_braille_display
```


### Virtual Environment (venv)
It's **optional**, but we us it. It's no so hard.
As of python3 venv is a standard module and need
not be installed.  Create the environment,
activate the environment, do your stuff, and
when done, deactivate      the environmet.


Creating virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Leaving environment
```
deactivate
``` 


#### Simple test (single process, only wxPython exercised)
Useful for debugging
```
py -m graphics_braille.wx_braille_display
```
## Notable text map modifications
These changes were the results of experiences with and comments from some 8th grade students at the Perkins School for the Blind.

- Non-trailing blanks are replaced with "," characters so as not to be compressed by the braille producing software.  The ","
characters, while not being "blank" are single dot braille constructs, provide an "empty-like" view.
- Blank area above and to the left is reduced to facilitate viewers finding graphics objects.

### braille display window - with audio feedback
Note that the color of the braille dots is for the implementer's view to empasize the color.
Also the rectangles surrounding the dots are to further help the visual image.
### Braille Window - audio feedback - An implementation aid, providing the likely braille view

![Program printout](https://github.com/raysmith619/graphics_braille/raw/main/Docs/spokes_print_output.PNG)

## Supported turtle commands
Because of our post running, screen scanning technique, we support all turtle commands, not requiring animation.  That is, we take a static snapshot at the end of the program.


Our implementation has some harsh compromises:
- Our graphics resolution is currently 40 wide by 25 down for a 800 by 800 screen.  Note this is further constrained by the fact that our students' shared braille embosser is set to 30 characters wide.
- Colors are represented by braille for the color's first letter(English)
- No motion - yet

## TurtleBraille Support Files
- turtle_braille.py - direct outer interface to global turtle commands, and turtle object level commands
- braille_display.py - implements turtle commands in the braille setting and the creation of display braille window and text printout
- turtle_braille_link.py - simple link to support user level replacement of "from turtle import *" with "from turtle_braille_link import *" lines
