# atmoflux
A Python package for atmospheric and surface flux calculation and analysis.

## Abstract
**atmoflux** is a Python library for atmospheric and surface flux calculations relevant to climate, micrometeorology, and urban environmental research. The package provides modular tools for radiative, turbulent, hydrological, aerosol, and energy balance calculations, alongside supporting utilities for atmospheric state variables and physical constants.

The **atmoflux** library emphasizes physically explicit formulations and transparent diagnostics, supporting process-based analysis and integration with statistical or machine learning models.

**atmoflux** is being developed alongside dissertation research focused on urban microclimates, heat stress, and land–atmosphere interactions, and is intended to evolve as a flexible research framework rather than a fixed operational model.
