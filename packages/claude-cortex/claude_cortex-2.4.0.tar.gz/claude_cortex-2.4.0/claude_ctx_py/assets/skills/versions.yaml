# Version Management Guidelines
#
# When to increment versions:
# - MAJOR (X.0.0): Breaking changes to skill behavior, interface changes, major rewrites
# - MINOR (x.X.0): New patterns added, significant enhancements, new examples
# - PATCH (x.x.X): Bug fixes, typo corrections, minor clarifications
#
# Compatibility tracking:
# - Each version entry should include release_date, notes, and key changes
# - Maintain historical versions for rollback capability
# - Document breaking changes clearly in notes
#
# Example version progression:
# versions:
#   - "1.0.0"  # Initial release
#   - "1.1.0"  # Added new patterns
#   - "1.1.1"  # Fixed typos
#   - "2.0.0"  # Breaking changes to interface
