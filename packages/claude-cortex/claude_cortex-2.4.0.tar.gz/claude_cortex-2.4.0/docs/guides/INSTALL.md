# Installation & Usage Guide

## Installation

### Option 0: Legacy installer (deprecated)

```bash
./scripts/deprecated/install.sh
```

This installs the package, shell completions, and manpages in one step. For a Just wrapper:

```bash
just install
```

### Option 0.5: Post-install via the CLI

If the package is already installed, finish setup with:

```bash
cortex install post
```

This installs shell completions, manpages, and the local architecture docs.

### Option 1: Install from source (recommended for development)

```bash
cd ~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin
pipx install -e .
```

This installs the package in editable mode, so any changes you make to the code will be immediately available.

Alternative (uv):

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

If `cortex` is already available, you can also use:

```bash
cortex install package --manager uv --editable --dev --path .
```

### Option 2: Install from source (standard)

```bash
cd ~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin
pipx install .
```

Standard installation. You'll need to reinstall after making code changes:

```bash
pipx reinstall cortex-py
```

Alternative (uv):

```bash
uv pip install .
```

Or via CLI (requires `cortex` already installed):

```bash
cortex install package --manager pipx
```

### Option 3: Uninstall and reinstall

If you need to completely remove and reinstall:

```bash
pipx uninstall cortex-py
pipx install ~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin
```

## Usage

### TUI (Terminal User Interface)

Launch the interactive TUI:

```bash
cortex tui
```

### Launch Claude Code with Cortex

```bash
cortex start
```

The launcher creates `~/.cortex/cortex-config.json` on first run and uses it
along with `FLAGS.md` to select active flags, rules, modes, and principles. Override the Claude binary with
`--claude-bin` or pass extra Claude arguments after `--`.

Use `--modes` or `--flags` to override config/`FLAGS.md` for a single launch.
Add a `claude_args` array to `cortex-config.json` to pass persistent arguments
to Claude on every `cortex start`.

Alias: `cortex claude`

### CLI Commands

#### Agents
```bash
cortex agent list                    # List all agents
cortex agent activate <name>         # Activate agent
cortex agent deactivate <name>       # Deactivate agent
cortex agent info <name>             # Show agent details
```

#### Modes
```bash
cortex mode list                     # List all modes
cortex mode activate <name>          # Activate mode
cortex mode deactivate <name>        # Deactivate mode
```

#### Rules
```bash
cortex rules list                    # List all rules
cortex rules activate <name>         # Activate rule
cortex rules deactivate <name>       # Deactivate rule
```

Rules are file-based: active rules live in `rules/`, inactive rules live in
`inactive/rules/`. The CLI/TUI toggles rules by moving files between those
folders and regenerating `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Skills
```bash
cortex skills list                   # List local skills
cortex skills info <name>            # Show skill details
cortex skills validate <name>        # Validate skill
cortex skills community list         # Browse community skills
cortex skills community search <term># Search community skills
```

#### Worktrees
```bash
cortex worktree list                 # List git worktrees
cortex worktree add <branch>         # Add a worktree
cortex worktree remove <target>      # Remove a worktree
cortex worktree prune --dry-run      # Prune stale worktrees
cortex worktree dir <path>           # Set base directory
```

#### Init & Migration
```bash
cortex init detect                   # Detect project type
cortex init profile backend          # Apply a profile
cortex init status                   # Show init status
cortex setup migrate                 # Migrate to .active-* activation
cortex setup migrate-commands --dry-run   # Preview command layout migration
cortex setup migrate-commands --force     # Overwrite conflicts (backups created)
```

If you add or update CLI subcommands, regenerate shell completions so the new options appear.

#### Status
```bash
cortex status                        # Show system overview
```

## Configuration

Configuration files live in the active Cortex directory (default `~/.cortex/`).
The same layout applies to project-local `.claude/` when you use `--scope project`
or set `CORTEX_SCOPE=project`.

### Core Framework Files

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Main manifest with `@` references | Primary entry point for context assembly |
| `FLAGS.md` | Flag activation list (`@flags/*.md`) | Updated by TUI Flag Manager; used by `cortex start` |
| `PRINCIPLES.md` | Engineering principles | Generated from `principles/*.md` |
| `RULES.md` | Core rules | Included by `CLAUDE.md` |

### Launcher Configuration

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cortex-config.json` | Launcher settings for `cortex start` | Controls active rules/modes/principles, settings path, and `claude_args` (flags come from `FLAGS.md` unless overridden) |

#### `cortex-config.json` Fields

```json
{
  "plugin_dir": "/path/to/claude-cortex",
  "plugin_id": "cortex",
  "extra_plugin_dirs": ["/path/to/other-plugin"],
  "rules": ["workflow-rules", "quality-rules"],
  "flags": ["performance-optimization", "security-hardening"],
  "modes": ["Deep_Analysis", "Quality_Focus"],
  "principles": ["00-core-directive", "10-philosophy"],
  "settings_path": "~/.claude/settings.json",
  "claude_args": ["--model", "claude-3.5-sonnet", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"],
  "watch": {
    "directories": ["~/repo1", "~/repo2"],
    "auto_activate": true,
    "threshold": 0.7,
    "interval": 2.0
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin_dir` | string | auto-detected | Explicit plugin root path. Overrides auto-discovery. |
| `plugin_id` | string | auto-detected | Plugin ID used to resolve install path from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` if `plugin_dir` is not set. |
| `extra_plugin_dirs` | string[] | `[]` | Additional plugin directories passed to Claude via repeated `--plugin-dir`. |
| `rules` | string[] | all rules in `rules/` | Rule slugs (without `.md`) to symlink into `~/.claude/rules/cortex`. |
| `flags` | string[] | from `FLAGS.md` | Fallback list if `FLAGS.md` is missing. Use `--flags` to override per launch. |
| `modes` | string[] | `[]` | Mode slugs (without `.md`) appended to the system prompt. |
| `principles` | string[] | all principles snippets | Principles snippet filenames (without `.md`) appended to the system prompt. |
| `settings_path` | string | template `settings.json` if present | Optional path passed to Claude via `--settings`. |
| `claude_args` | string[] | `[]` | Extra args always passed to `claude` before any per-run `--` args. |
| `watch` | object | unset | Default watch-mode settings (directories, auto-activate, threshold, interval). |

Notes:
- `flags` are read from `FLAGS.md` when present, so `flags` in config only applies if `FLAGS.md` is missing.
- `claude_args` should be a JSON array of strings. If you provide a single string, it is parsed with shell-style splitting.

### Principles Snippets

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `principles/*.md` | Principles snippets | Concatenated by `cortex principles build` |

### Activation State Files

| Path | Purpose | Notes |

| `.active-rules` | Active rules list | Legacy tracking for profiles/wizard; rules are active by file location |
| `.active-mcp` | Active MCP docs list | Reference-based activation |
| `.active-principles` | Active principles snippet list | Used by `cortex principles build` (order is filename-sorted) |

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

## Troubleshooting

### TUI not updating after code changes

```bash
pipx reinstall cortex-py
```

### Missing dependency errors

```bash
pipx inject cortex-py <package-name>
```

Example for PyYAML:
```bash
pipx inject cortex-py PyYAML
```

### Clear Python cache

```bash
cd ~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Complete reinstall

```bash
pipx uninstall cortex-py
cd ~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
pipx install .
```

## Development Workflow

1. Make code changes in `~/Developer/personal/cortex-plugin/`
2. Clear cache: `find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +`
3. Reinstall: `pipx reinstall cortex-py`
4. Test: `cortex tui`
