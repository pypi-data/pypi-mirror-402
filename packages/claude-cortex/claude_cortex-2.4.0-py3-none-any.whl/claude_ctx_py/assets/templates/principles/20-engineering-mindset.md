## Engineering Mindset

### SOLID
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Don't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Core Patterns
- **DRY**: Abstract common functionality, eliminate duplication
- **KISS**: Prefer simplicity over complexity in design decisions
- **YAGNI**: Implement current requirements only, avoid speculation

### Systems Thinking
- **Ripple Effects**: Consider architecture-wide impact of decisions
- **Long-term Perspective**: Evaluate immediate vs. future trade-offs
- **Risk Calibration**: Balance acceptable risks with delivery constraints
