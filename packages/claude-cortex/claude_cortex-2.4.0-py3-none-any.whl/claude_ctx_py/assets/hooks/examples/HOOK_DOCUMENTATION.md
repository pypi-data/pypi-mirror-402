# Implementation Quality Gate - Final Complete Version

## ✅ Three-Phase Quality Gate Complete!

**Version:** 3.0 (Final)
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Executive Summary

Your implementation quality gate now enforces a **complete, professional development workflow** with three mandatory phases:

1. **Phase 1: Testing** → test-automator (≥85% coverage)
2. **Phase 2: Documentation** → Intelligent routing + docs-architect review (≥7.5/10)
3. **Phase 3: Code Review** → quality-engineer + code-reviewer (HIGH/MEDIUM issues must be resolved)

**No implementation can complete without passing all three phases.**

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Testing (test-automator)

**Requirements:**
- Tests generated for all new code
- Coverage ≥85% (or user permission)
- All tests pass (new + pre-existing)
- Cannot modify pre-existing tests without permission

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Coverage ≥85% → Proceed to Phase 2
- ⚠️  Coverage <85% → Ask user permission

---

### Phase 2: Documentation (Intelligent Routing)

**User-Facing Changes:**
- **Detects:** "UI", "UX", "frontend", "user", "tutorial"
- **Agents:** tutorial-engineer + technical-writer
- **Creates:** User guides, tutorials, walkthroughs

**API/Library Changes:**
- **Detects:** "API", "endpoint", "function", "class", "library"
- **Agents:** api-documenter
- **Creates:** API reference, docstrings, developer docs

**Review:**
- docs-architect scores documentation
- **Requirement:** ≥7.5/10
- **If <7.5:** Claude revises automatically

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ docs-architect score ≥7.5 → Proceed to Phase 3
- ⚠️  Score <7.5 → Revise and re-review

---

### Phase 3: Code Review (NEW!)

**Reviewers:**
- **quality-engineer:** Code quality, maintainability, best practices
- **code-reviewer:** Bugs, edge cases, performance, security

**Priority System:**
- **HIGH:** Critical issues, must fix immediately
- **MEDIUM:** Quality/maintainability issues, must fix
- **LOW:** Nice to have improvements

**Resolution Rules:**
1. Fix ALL HIGH priority issues (no exceptions without user permission)
2. Fix ALL MEDIUM priority issues (no exceptions without user permission)
3. Ask user about LOW priority issues

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ All HIGH issues resolved → Proceed
- ✅ All MEDIUM issues resolved OR user permission → Proceed
- ⚠️  Issues remain → Fix or request user permission

---

## Agent Orchestration

### All Implementations Activate:
1. **test-automator** (Phase 1: Testing)
2. **docs-architect** (Phase 2: Documentation review)
3. **quality-engineer** (Phase 3: Code quality)
4. **code-reviewer** (Phase 3: Code review)

### Change-Type Specific:

**User-Facing:**
- tutorial-engineer
- technical-writer

**API/Library:**
- api-documenter

### Total Agents: 7
```
Core (always):
├── test-automator
├── docs-architect
├── quality-engineer
└── code-reviewer

Conditional (based on change type):
├── User-facing:
│   ├── tutorial-engineer
│   └── technical-writer
└── API/library:
    └── api-documenter
```

---

## Configuration

**File:** `~/.claude/hooks/implementation-quality-gate.sh`

```bash
# Thresholds
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=85              # Test coverage minimum
DOCS_REVIEW_THRESHOLD=7.5          # Documentation review minimum
CODE_REVIEW_REQUIRED=true          # Enable Phase 3

# To disable code review (not recommended):
# CODE_REVIEW_REQUIRED=false
```

---

## Example: Complete Flow

### User Prompt
```
"implement user authentication API with JWT"
```

### Phase 1: Testing
```
Claude:
1. [Implements authentication endpoint]
2. [test-automator generates tests]
   - test_login_success
   - test_login_invalid_credentials
   - test_token_generation
   - test_token_validation
   - test_expired_token
3. [Runs test suite]
4. ✅ Coverage: 91%
5. ✅ All tests pass
```

### Phase 2: Documentation
```
Claude:
6. [Change type detected: API]
7. [api-documenter creates API documentation]

   POST /api/auth/login
   Authentication endpoint

   Parameters:
   - username (string, required)
   - password (string, required)

   Returns:
   - token (string): JWT token
   - expires_at (timestamp): Token expiration

   Example:
   curl -X POST /api/auth/login \
     -d '{"username":"user","password":"pass"}'

8. [Requests docs-architect review]
9. ✅ docs-architect score: 8.0/10
   "Clear documentation with good examples"
```

### Phase 3: Code Review
```
Claude:
10. [Requests quality-engineer review]
    Findings:
    - HIGH: Password stored in plain text in logs
    - MEDIUM: No rate limiting on login attempts
    - LOW: Could add more descriptive variable names

11. [Requests code-reviewer review]
    Findings:
    - HIGH: JWT secret hardcoded (security risk)
    - MEDIUM: No input sanitization
    - LOW: Consider using async for database calls

12. [Fixes HIGH priority issues]
    ✅ Removed password logging
    ✅ Moved JWT secret to environment variable

13. [Fixes MEDIUM priority issues]
    ✅ Added rate limiting (5 attempts/minute)
    ✅ Added input sanitization

14. [Asks about LOW priority]
    "I've fixed all HIGH and MEDIUM issues. Would you like me
     to address the LOW priority suggestions (variable naming,
     async database calls)?"

User: "yes, make it async"

15. [Implements async database calls]
16. ✅ Re-review: All issues resolved

Implementation complete! ✅
```

## Exit Scenarios

### ✅ Success (All Gates Pass)
```
✅ Coverage: 91%
✅ Documentation score: 8.2/10
✅ HIGH issues: 0
✅ MEDIUM issues: 0
✅ LOW issues: 2 (user declined)

→ Implementation complete!
```

### ⚠️ User Permission Required
```
⚠️  Coverage: 78% (threshold: 85%)
Claude asks: "May I proceed with 78% coverage?"

Option A: User says "yes" → Proceed
Option B: User says "no" → Add more tests
```

### ⚠️ Documentation Revision Required
```
⚠️  docs-architect score: 6.5/10 (threshold: 7.5)
Feedback: "Missing error handling examples"

Claude revises → Re-requests review → Score: 8.0/10 ✅
```

### ⚠️ Code Issues Found
```
HIGH priority issues: 2
MEDIUM priority issues: 3

Claude fixes all HIGH + MEDIUM → Re-review → ✅ All resolved
```

### 🚫 Blocked (User Must Decide)
```
Claude: "Found 3 HIGH priority security issues:
1. SQL injection vulnerability
2. Hardcoded credentials
3. Missing authentication check

May I skip fixing these? (NOT RECOMMENDED)"

User must either:
- Grant permission (risky)
- Let Claude fix (recommended)
```

## Benefits of Three-Phase Gate

### Phase 1: Testing
- Prevents bugs from reaching production
- Ensures code reliability
- Protects existing functionality

### Phase 2: Documentation
- Enables team collaboration
- Reduces onboarding time
- Improves maintainability

### Phase 3: Code Review (NEW!)
- Catches bugs before deployment
- Enforces best practices
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Improves code quality
- Knowledge sharing

### Combined Effect
```
Without Gate:
├── Implementation → Done
└── Issues discovered in production ❌

With Three-Phase Gate:
├── Implementation
├── Phase 1: Tests catch functional bugs ✅
├── Phase 2: Docs enable understanding ✅
├── Phase 3: Reviews catch quality issues ✅
└── High-quality, documented, tested code → Production ✅
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Phase 3 Not Triggering
**Check:** `CODE_REVIEW_REQUIRED=true` in hook script
```bash
grep CODE_REVIEW_REQUIRED ~/.claude/hooks/implementation-quality-gate.sh
```

### Agents Not Activating
**Check:** Agent status
```bash
cortex agent status | grep -E "(quality-engineer|code-reviewer)"
```

**Fix:** Activate manually
```bash
cortex agent activate quality-engineer code-reviewer
```

### Too Many Issues Found
**Option 1:** Fix incrementally
**Option 2:** Lower standards (not recommended)
**Option 3:** Request user permission for LOW priority only

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Complete Workflow
```
Prompt: "implement user login API with email verification"

Expected:
Phase 1: Tests generated (authentication, email, validation)
Phase 2: API documentation created and reviewed
Phase 3: Code reviewed for security, quality, bugs
Result: Production-ready implementation
```

### 2. Monitor Metrics
Track over time:
- Average issues per phase (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Documentation scores
- Revision frequency
- Time to complete all phases

### 3. Adjust as Needed
- Too strict? Lower thresholds
- Too lenient? Raise thresholds
- Disable code review for prototypes: `CODE_REVIEW_REQUIRED=false`

---

## Success Criteria

**Your three-phase gate is working when:**

1. ✅ All implementations go through 3 phases
2. ✅ test-automator generates tests automatically
3. ✅ Documentation agents route correctly (user-facing vs API)
4. ✅ docs-architect reviews documentation
5. ✅ quality-engineer + code-reviewer both review code
6. ✅ HIGH/MEDIUM issues get fixed
7. ✅ Claude asks permission for LOW priority
8. ✅ Implementation only completes when all phases pass

**Test it now:** "implement a payment processing API with Stripe integration"
