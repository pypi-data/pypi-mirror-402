# Execution Control Flags

Flags to control execution behavior, validation, and safety.

**Estimated tokens: ~150**

---

**--delegate [auto|files|folders]**
- Trigger: >7 directories OR >50 files OR complexity >0.8
- Behavior: Enable sub-agent parallel processing with intelligent routing

**--concurrency [n]**
- Trigger: Resource optimization needs, parallel operation control
- Behavior: Control max concurrent operations (range: 1-15)

**--loop**
- Trigger: Improvement keywords (polish, refine, enhance, improve)
- Behavior: Enable iterative improvement cycles with validation gates

**--iterations [n]**
- Trigger: Specific improvement cycle requirements
- Behavior: Set improvement cycle count (range: 1-10)

**--validate**
- Trigger: Risk score >0.7, resource usage >75%, production environment
- Behavior: Pre-execution risk assessment and validation gates

**--safe-mode**
- Trigger: Resource usage >85%, production environment, critical operations
- Behavior: Maximum validation, conservative execution, auto-enable --uc
