# Quality Rules

## Code Organization
- Follow existing naming conventions; do not mix casing styles.
- Use descriptive names and mirror existing project structure.

## Failure Investigation
- Find root causes; do not disable or skip tests.
- Fix the underlying issue, then validate with tests or logs.
