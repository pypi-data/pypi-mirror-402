## Graph-based Clustering and Semi-Supervised Learning

![Clustering](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning/raw/master/images/clustering.png)

This python package is devoted to efficient implementations of modern graph-based learning algorithms for semi-supervised learning, active learning, and clustering. The package implements many popular datasets (currently MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10) in a way that makes it simple for users to test out new algorithms and rapidly compare against existing methods. Full [documentation](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/) is available, including detailed example scripts.

This package also reproduces experiments from the paper

J. Calder, B. Cook, M. Thorpe, D. Slepcev. [Poisson Learning: Graph Based Semi-Supervised Learning at Very Low Label Rates.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/calder20a.html), Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 119:1306-1316, 2020.

**Important:** The variational autoencoder embedding (VAE) for MNIST has been improved since our ICML paper was published. To make this more clear, I have now updated the package so that `metric=vae` is the old VAE from our ICML paper, while `metric=vae2` is the new updated VAE, which gives better results. Please note which one you are using to make comparisons. Note that in a previous version of the package, I used `vae_old` in place of `vae` and `vae` instead of `vae2`. 

## Installation

Install with
```sh
pip install graphlearning
```
Required packages will be installed automatically, and include numpy, scipy, sklearn, and matplotlib. Some features in the package rely on other packages, including [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) for approximate nearest neighbor searches, and [torch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for GPU acceleration. You will have to install these manually, if needed, with
```sh
pip install annoy torch
```
It can be difficult to install annoy, depending on your operating system. 

To install the most recent version of GraphLearning from the github source, which is updated more frequently, run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning
cd GraphLearning
pip install .
```
If you prefer to use ssh swap the first line with
```sh
git clone git@github.com:jwcalder/GraphLearning.git
```

## Documentation and Examples

Full documentation for the package is available [here](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/). The documentation includes examples of how to use the package. All example scripts linked from the documentation can be found in the examples folder. 

## Older versions of GraphLearning

This repository hosts the current version of the package, which is numbered >=1.0.0. This version is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of the package. The old version is archived [here](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearningOld) and can be installed with
```sh
pip install graphlearning==0.0.3
```
To make sure you will load the old version when running `import graphlearning`, it may be necessary to uninstall all existing versions `pip uninstall graphlearning` before running the installation command above.
