**Bridge the gap between conceptual models and your lakehouse.**

---

## ⚠️ Opinionated by Design

This tool is built for a specific architecture. It expects:

- **dbt** — Your transformation layer
- **Medallion architecture** — Silver (cleaned/conformed) → Gold (business/integrated)
- **Dimensional modeling** — dims, facts, bridges in gold

**What we're opinionated about:**
- Naming conventions (`dim_`, `fact_`, `bridge_` prefixes)
- Layer structure (silver/gold concepts)
- Conceptual model in a single `conceptual.yml` file

**What we're flexible about:**
- Whether you use one `schema.yml` per model or shared schema files
- Your specific silver/gold path names (configurable)
- Whether you use dbt groups, tags, or other organizational features

If that's not your stack, this tool is not for you. No judgment — just not the target audience.

---

## The Problem

Every data team has a conceptual model — *"we have Customers, Orders, Products"* — but it lives in PowerPoint, Visio, ERD tools, or people's heads. Disconnected from code. Diverging from reality. Rotting.

```
CONCEPTUAL MODEL                          LAKEHOUSE
(slides, whiteboards, heads)              (dbt, Databricks, Snowflake)

  Customer ── Order ── Product    →→→     dim_customer_shopify, dim_customer_crm,
                                          dim_product, fact_order_lines,
        🤷 GAP 🤷                          bridge_customer_segment...
```

When someone asks *"Do we have Customer data?"* — you grep through 200 models hoping to find the answer.

## The Solution

**dbt-conceptual** tracks which business concepts your dbt models implement:

```yaml
# models/conceptual/conceptual.yml
concepts:
  customer:
    domain: party
    owner: customer_team
    definition: "A person or company that purchases products"

  order:
    domain: transaction
    owner: orders_team
    definition: "A confirmed purchase by a customer"

relationships:
  - name: places
    from: customer
    to: order

  - name: contains
    from: order
    to: product
```

```yaml
# models/gold/dim_customer/dim_customer.yml
models:
  - name: dim_customer
    meta:
      concept: customer

# models/gold/fact_order_lines/fact_order_lines.yml
models:
  - name: fact_order_lines
    meta:
      realizes:
        - customer:places:order
        - order:contains:product
```

Then visualize, validate, and export:

```
┌──────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐
│      Customer        │         │        Order         │         │       Product        │
│                      │         │                      │         │                      │
│   [S:●●] [G:●]       │━places━▶│   [S:●]  [G:●]       │━contains▶│   [S:●]  [G:●]      │
└──────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘
```

## Installation

```bash
# No signup required. No telemetry. No "please star this repo" popups.
pip install dbt-conceptual
```

## Quick Start

Try it with the [jaffle-shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) demo project:

```bash
# Clone jaffle-shop
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop.git
cd jaffle-shop

# Install dbt-conceptual
pip install dbt-conceptual[serve]

# Initialize conceptual model
dbt-conceptual init
# This creates models/conceptual/conceptual.yml

# Define your business concepts (see example below)
# Edit models/conceptual/conceptual.yml

# View coverage
dbt-conceptual status

# Launch interactive UI
dbt-conceptual serve

# Validate in CI
dbt-conceptual validate

# Export diagrams
dbt-conceptual export --format excalidraw -o diagram.excalidraw
```

**Example conceptual.yml for jaffle-shop:**
```yaml
version: 1

domains:
  party:
    name: Party
    color: "#E3F2FD"
  transaction:
    name: Transaction
    color: "#FFF3E0"

concepts:
  customer:
    name: Customer
    domain: party
    definition: "A person or entity that places orders"
    status: complete

  order:
    name: Order
    domain: transaction
    definition: "A purchase transaction made by a customer"
    status: complete

relationships:
  - name: places
    from: customer
    to: order
    cardinality: "1:N"
```

Then tag your dbt models:
```yaml
# models/customers.yml
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      concept: customer

# models/orders.yml
models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      realizes:
        - customer:places:order
```

## Features

### 📊 Coverage Tracking

See which concepts are implemented at each layer:

```
$ dbt-conceptual status

Concepts by Domain
==================

party (1 concept)
  ✓ customer [complete]     [S:●●] [G:●]

transaction (2 concepts)
  ✓ order [complete]        [S:●]  [G:●]
  ⚠ shipment [stub]         [S:○]  [G:○]

catalog (1 concept)
  ✓ product [complete]      [S:●]  [G:●]
```

### 🎨 Interactive Web UI

Launch a visual editor for your conceptual model with real-time editing:

```bash
$ dbt-conceptual serve
Starting dbt-conceptual UI server...
Open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Features:**
- **Graph Editor** — Interactive force-directed graph visualization with D3.js
  - Drag and position concepts
  - Click concepts/relationships to edit
  - Real-time visual updates
  - Domain-based coloring
  - Zoom and pan canvas
- **Direct Editing** — Changes save directly to `conceptual.yml`
  - Edit concept name, description, definition, domain, owner, status
  - Edit relationship name, from/to concepts, cardinality, description
  - No sync needed - what you see is what gets saved
- **Integrated Reports** — View coverage and bus matrix in tabs
  - Coverage Report tab shows concept completion and implementations
  - Bus Matrix tab shows which fact tables realize which relationships
  - Switch between Editor, Coverage, and Bus Matrix views

**Installation:**
```bash
# UI requires Flask
pip install dbt-conceptual[serve]

# Or install Flask separately
pip install flask
```

### ✅ CI Validation

Catch drift before it ships:

```bash
$ dbt-conceptual validate

ERROR: dim_customer_legacy references concept 'client' which does not exist
       Did you mean: 'customer'?

ERROR: fact_returns realizes 'customer:returns:order' 
       but relationship 'returns' does not exist
```

### 📤 Export Formats

```bash
# Excalidraw — editable diagrams
dbt-conceptual export --format excalidraw

# PNG — static diagram image
dbt-conceptual export --format png -o diagram.png

# Mermaid — for docs and GitHub
dbt-conceptual export --format mermaid

# Coverage report — HTML dashboard
dbt-conceptual export --format coverage

# Bus matrix — dimensions vs facts
dbt-conceptual export --format bus-matrix
```

**PNG Export Note:** Requires Pillow. Install with `pip install dbt-conceptual[png]`

---

## How It Works

### 1. Define Concepts

Create `models/conceptual/conceptual.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1

domains:
  party:
    name: "Party"
    color: "#E3F2FD"
  transaction:
    name: "Transaction"
    color: "#FFF3E0"
  catalog:
    name: "Catalog"
    color: "#F1F8E9"

concepts:
  customer:
    name: "Customer"
    domain: party
    owner: customer_team
    definition: "A person or company that purchases products"
    status: complete

  order:
    name: "Order"
    domain: transaction
    owner: orders_team
    definition: "A confirmed purchase by a customer"
    status: complete

  product:
    name: "Product"
    domain: catalog
    owner: catalog_team
    definition: "An item available for purchase"
    status: complete

relationships:
  - name: places
    from: customer
    to: order
    cardinality: "1:N"

  - name: contains
    from: order
    to: product
    cardinality: "N:M"
```

### 2. Tag dbt Models

Add `meta.concept` to dimensions:

```yaml
# models/gold/dim_customer/dim_customer.yml
version: 2
models:
  - name: dim_customer
    description: "Customer dimension"
    meta:
      concept: customer
```

Add `meta.realizes` to facts and bridges:

```yaml
# models/gold/fact_order_lines/fact_order_lines.yml
version: 2
models:
  - name: fact_order_lines
    description: "Order line items fact"
    meta:
      realizes:
        - customer:places:order
        - order:contains:product
```

### 3. Validate & Visualize

```bash
# Check everything links up
dbt-conceptual validate

# See coverage
dbt-conceptual status

# Open visual editor
dbt-conceptual serve
```

---

## Bottom-Up Adoption

Already have a dbt project? Start tagging models, then generate the conceptual model:

```bash
# Add tags to your existing schema.yml files
# Then run:
dbt-conceptual sync --create-stubs

# Output:
# Created 12 concept stubs
# Created 8 relationship stubs
# 
# Run 'dbt-conceptual status' to see what needs enrichment
```

The tags ARE the adoption. The tool just makes them visible.

---

## Configuration

Works out of the box. Override in `dbt_project.yml` if needed:

```yaml
vars:
  dbt_conceptual:
    conceptual_path: models/conceptual    # default
    silver_paths:
      - models/silver                     # default
      - models/staging                    # add custom paths
    gold_paths:
      - models/gold                       # default
      - models/marts                      # add custom paths
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
dbt-conceptual validate --gold-paths models/marts
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install dbt-core dbt-conceptual

      - name: Validate conceptual model
        run: dbt-conceptual validate --format github
```

Use `--format github` for native GitHub Actions annotations. Errors and warnings will appear inline in PR diffs.

### Validation Rules Configuration

Configure which validation rules are errors, warnings, or ignored in `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
vars:
  dbt_conceptual:
    validation:
      orphan_models: warn          # Models not linked to any concept
      unimplemented_concepts: warn # Concepts with no implementing models
      unrealized_relationships: warn # Relationships with no realizing models
      missing_definitions: ignore  # Concepts without definitions
      domain_mismatch: warn        # Models with meta.domain != concept domain
```

Severity options: `error`, `warn`, `ignore`

**Note:** Unknown references (e.g., `meta.concept: nonexistent`) are always errors and cannot be configured.
