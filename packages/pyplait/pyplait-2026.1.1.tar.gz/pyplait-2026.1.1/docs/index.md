# plait Documentation

Welcome to **plait**, a PyTorch-inspired framework for building, executing, and
optimizing LLM inference pipelines.

Use the navigation on the left to explore guides, tutorials, the API reference,
and design documentation.

## Highlights

- PyTorch-like authoring with `Module`, `Parameter`, and `forward()`
- Automatic DAG capture with async execution and backpressure
- Resource-aware scheduling and LLM endpoint management
- Optional feedback-driven optimization

## Where to go next

- **Getting Started**: install plait and run your first pipeline
- **Tutorials**: end-to-end walkthroughs and recipes
- **API Reference**: auto-generated from Google-style docstrings
- **Design**: architecture and internals for advanced usage
