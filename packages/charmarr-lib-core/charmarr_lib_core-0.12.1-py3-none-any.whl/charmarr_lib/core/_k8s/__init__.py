"""Kubernetes utilities for resource management and patching.

This package provides utilities for interacting with Kubernetes resources
via lightkube, with a focus on patching StatefulSets managed by Juju.

Key components:
- K8sResourceManager: Generic K8s resource operations with retry logic (from charmarr-lib-krm)
- reconcile_storage_volume: Mount shared PVCs in StatefulSets
- reconcile_hardware_transcoding: Mount hardware devices for GPU transcoding
- check_storage_permissions: Verify puid/pgid can write to mounted storage
