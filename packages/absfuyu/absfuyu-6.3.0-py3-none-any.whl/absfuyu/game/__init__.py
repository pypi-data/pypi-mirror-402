Are you sure about this?
Don't leave me =((
I can't believe you did this to me!
Are you very much sure?
I'll be sad. Pick again please.
I still don't believe you.
Choose again.
You actually have to answer the correct keyword
I think you need to choose again.
Last chance!
Okay okay, i believe you ;)
Almost there.
I can do this all day
So close!
You can't escape from me.
How are you still here, just to suffer?
Never gonna give you up
