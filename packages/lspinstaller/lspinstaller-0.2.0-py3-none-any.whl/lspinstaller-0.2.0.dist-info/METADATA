# LSP installer

Utility script for installing various LSPs, because software packaging standards still fucking suck.

**Warning:** this is an experimental script that has not been extensively tested. Use with caution. It was hacked together in a single evening/night, and likely has multiple, large problems.

<!-- If this list ever gets Sufficiently Big:tm:, replace with "has support for over X servers, including:" and only some notable examples. -->
Currently has support for 6 servers:

* tsserver
* pyright
* kotlin-lsp
* luals
* clangd
* astral-sh/ty

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Linux or Windows (though Windows support is limited)
    * macOS is intentionally not supported

Additionally, the following tools are used, but are optional unless you install packages that depend on it:

* `npm`
* `python3` with `venv`

## Installing

### From pypi
https://pypi.org/project/lspinstaller/
```
pip3 install lspinstaller
```

### From source
IOU 1x instruction set

## General usage

* `lspinstaller list` to see what exists
* `lspinstaller update` to update LSPs you have installed
* `lspinstaller install <lsp>` to install new LSPs

All of these accept `--help`. Additional information is available through `lspinstaller --help`.

## FAQ

### What LSP servers are supported, and how do I install them?

See `lspinstaller list`, or `lspinstaller/data/sources.py` if you would like to check before installing.

To install a server, run `lspinstaller install server-name`, where `server-name` corresponds to one of the servers from the list. The `install` command can take any number of LSPs at once, so if you want to install several, you can append them to the command.

### How are the servers installed?

Depending on availability:

1. Binary install
2. Npm install (requires `npm` in PATH)
3. Pip install (requires `python3` and `venv` for first-time setup)

System package managers are not supported; if you can install via a system package manager, do that instead. This script exists for operating systems where there are no package manager, the package manager doesn't include a given LSP, or the OS is debian-based (or follows a debian-like idiology) where the LSPs that are available are heavily out of date. 


### Where are the servers installed, and how do I use them?

They're installed to `~/.local/share/lsp/`. This applies to both Windows and Linux.

Eventually, there will likely be a `~/.local/share/lsp/bin` directory that contains all the non-npm LSPs, but  this currently does not work for whatever fucking reason. With clangd, this manifests as `limits.h` missing. This was observed when the _exact same binary_ breaks when referencing a symlink location, and breaking when referencing the real location. It's unclear why this is the case, and if it can be fixed.

In the meanwhile, you need to explicitly specify the full path, and keep track of it yourself. For example:

* Clangd is installed to `~/.local/share/lsp/clangd/bin/clangd`
* kotlin-lsp is installed to `~/.local/share/lsp/kotlin-lsp/bin/kotlin-lsp.sh`

The name used for the `install` command matches the subfolder name in `~/.local/share/lsp/`.

It is still a manual process though, so it's strongly recommended that you automate it once so you don't have to touch it again. The locations are guaranteed to never change incompatibly.

### How do I configure the servers?

See the documentation for your LSP plugin and/or editor. Some known-good config settings for the servers supported by lspinstaller that works with [yegappan/lsp](https://github.com/yegappan/lsp) can be found [here](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/vimrc-modules/blob/master/autoload/modules/lsp.vim).
