# augmentatio

**augmentatio** is a Python package that exists in a conceptual space where purpose gently dissolves into abstraction. It does not aim to solve problems, create value, or introduce clarity. Instead, it confidently occupies disk space and embraces the art of saying things without meaning them.

## Introduction

The `augmentatio` package was born out of a deep need to generate text that looks important while remaining fundamentally empty. It is verbose, confident, and unapologetically circular. If you have ever wanted a library that *appears* to do something, `augmentatio` is here for you.

At its core, `augmentatio` is about augmentatioing the augmentatio until the augmentatio becomes augmentatio.

## Philosophy

The guiding principles of `augmentatio` include:

- Everything is something, except when it is nothing.
- More words are better than fewer words.
- If it compiles, it probably works.
- Meaning is optional, formatting is not.

This package does not judge. It merely outputs metaphorical hand-waving wrapped in syntactic confidence.

## Installation

Install `augmentatio` using pip, poetry, conda, or interpretive dance:

```bash
pip install augmentatio
