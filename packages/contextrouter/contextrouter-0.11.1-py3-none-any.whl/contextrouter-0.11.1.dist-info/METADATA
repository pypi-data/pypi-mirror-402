           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and derivative works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,
                  attribution and other notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Support, Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

> ⚠️ **Early Version**: This is an early version of ContextRouter. Documentation is actively being developed, and the API may change.

## What is ContextRouter?

ContextRouter is a modular framework for building intelligent AI agents based on LangGraph. It acts as a "shared brain" that can handle complex tasks by combining information retrieval, text generation, and tool execution.

Unlike simple chatbots, ContextRouter can perform multi-step tasks: analyze queries, search for relevant information, apply logic, and provide structured responses.

## What is it for?

ContextRouter is designed for developers and companies who want to:

- **Build complex AI agents** — from simple Q&A systems to sophisticated workflows
- **Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — search and generate responses based on your data
- **Create platform-independent solutions** — works with web, Telegram, API, or any other platform
- **Ensure security and traceability** — every piece of data has a provenance history

### Typical use cases:
- Corporate chatbots with knowledge bases
- AI assistants for document analysis
- Search-based recommendation systems
- Intelligent agents for business process automation

## Key Features

- **🧩 Fully Modular** — swap any component: LLM models, data stores, connectors, agents, and even entire processing graphs
- **🧠 Intelligent Orchestration** — sophisticated state management and conditional routing based on LangGraph
- **🛡️ Security and Tracing** — built-in Bisquit protocol for tracking data provenance
- **📡 Streaming-Oriented** — optimized for real-time and event-driven interfaces
- **🌍 Flexible Data Sources** — support for various storage solutions: Vertex AI Search, upcoming Postgres and local models support
- **🔧 Extensible by Design** — build custom agents, processing graphs, and integrations without touching core code

## Modules Overview

ContextRouter's architecture is built around specialized modules:

- **`modules/providers/`** — Data storage implementations (Vertex AI Search, Postgres, GCS)
- **`modules/connectors/`** — Raw data fetchers (Web search, RSS feeds, APIs, local files)
- **`modules/ingestion/`** — Data ingestion pipelines (ETL, indexing, RAG processing, deployment)
- **`modules/retrieval/`** — Search and RAG orchestration (pipelines, reranking, formatting)
- **`modules/models/`** — LLM and embedding model abstractions (Gemini, GPT, local models)
- **`modules/protocols/`** — Platform adapters (AG-UI events, A2A/A2UI protocols)

## RAG Capabilities

ContextRouter provides a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline powered by Vertex AI and Gemini:

### Ingestion Pipeline
- **Supported Content Types**: Books, articles, videos, Q&A pairs, web content, and custom structured data
- **Taxonomy & Ontology**: Automatic categorization and relationship mapping using AI-powered taxonomy builders
- **Knowledge Graph**: Semantic relationships and entity connections between ingested content
- **Citation System**: Precise source attribution with page numbers, timestamps, and context preservation

### Retrieval & Generation
- **Multi-stage Retrieval**: Initial search → reranking → context assembly
- **Citation Formatting**: Rich citations with source verification and confidence scores
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time generation with source citations and reasoning traces

### Vertex AI + Gemini Integration
The RAG system runs on Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search for scalable vector storage and Gemini models for intelligent processing, ensuring enterprise-grade performance and security.

### Quick RAG Implementation
Build a production-ready RAG system in hours, not months. For custom integrations, enterprise deployments, or specialized RAG solutions, visit [contextrouter.dev](https://contextrouter.dev) to discuss your requirements.

## Roadmap

We're actively developing ContextRouter with focus on expanding data source support and improving developer experience:

### Near-term priorities:
- **PostgreSQL Integration** — native support for Postgres with pgvector for knowledge storage
- **Cognee Memory Integration** — advanced memory and knowledge graph capabilities
- **Local Model Support** — run AI models locally without cloud dependencies
- **Plugin System & Library** — comprehensive plugin architecture for extending functionality

## Quick Start

```python
from contextrouter.cortex import stream_agent

# Initialize the shared brain
async for event in stream_agent(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How does RAG work?"}],
    session_id="session_123",
    platform="web",
    style_prompt="Be concise and technical."
):
    print(event)
```

For more examples, see the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory.

## Getting Started

1. **Install ContextRouter**:
   ```bash
   pip install contextrouter
   # For full functionality (recommended):
   pip install contextrouter[vertex,storage,ingestion]
   # Observability (optional):
   pip install contextrouter[observability]
   ```

2. **Configure your data sources** and LLM models
3. **Build your first agent** using the examples above
4. **Deploy** to your preferred platform (web, API, Telegram, etc.)

### Notes (Vertex / Gemini)

- **Vertex AI mode**: ContextRouter sets `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true` by default to avoid the
  Google GenAI SDK accidentally trying API-key auth. You can override it by exporting
  `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=false` before importing/starting ContextRouter.
