"""ETL Ingestion Module (Stub).

Future module for generic ETL pipelines:
- Data extraction from multiple sources (databases, APIs, files)
- Transformation pipelines (normalization, validation, enrichment)
- Loading into data warehouses or analytics platforms

This module will provide reusable ETL transformers and connectors
for non-RAG use cases (analytics, reporting, data migration).
