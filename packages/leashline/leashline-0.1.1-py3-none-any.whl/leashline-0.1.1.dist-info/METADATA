# Leashline

Leashline is a **local-first dog escape detection system** designed for areas
with poor cellular coverage.

It uses:
- LoRa/Meshtastic for local radio tracking
- Geofencing on a local base station
- Optional remote notifications (SMS / push)

Leashline is **not** a global GPS tracker.
It is designed to detect when a dog leaves a defined area and alert you immediately.

Status: early alpha.
