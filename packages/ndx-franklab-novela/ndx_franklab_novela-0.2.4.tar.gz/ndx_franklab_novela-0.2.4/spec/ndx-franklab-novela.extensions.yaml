  doc: General metadata about the optogenetic stimulation that may change per 
    epoch, with fields specific to Loren Frank Lab experiments. If the spatial 
    filter is ON, then the experimenter can stimulate in either open 
    (frequency-based) or closed loop (theta-based), only when animal is in a 
    particular position. If the spatial filter is OFF, then ignore the position 
    (this is not common / doesn't happen). If the spatial filter is ON and the 
    experimenter is stimulating in open loop mode and the animal enters the 
    spatial filter rectangle, then immediately apply one and only one 
    stimulation bout. If stimulating in closed loop mode and the animal enters 
    the rectangle, then every time the particular theta phase is detected, 
    immediately apply one stimulation bout (accounting for the lockout period).
