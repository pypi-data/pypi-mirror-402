    """Position nodes using the ForceAtlas2 force-directed layout algorithm.

    This function applies the ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm [1]_ to a NetworkX graph,
    positioning the nodes in a way that visually represents the structure of the graph.
    The algorithm uses physical simulation to minimize the energy of the system,
    resulting in a more readable layout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : np.ndarray
        Initial  position of  the nodes. The output will be stored in this variable.
    max_iter : int (default: 100)
        Number of iterations for the layout optimization.
    jitter_tolerance : float (default: 1.0)
        Controls the tolerance for adjusting the speed of layout generation.
    scaling_ratio : float (default: 2.0)
        Determines the scaling of attraction and repulsion forces.
    gravity : float (default: 1.0)
        Determines the amount of attraction on nodes to the center. Prevents islands
        (i.e. weakly connected or disconnected parts of the graph)
        from drifting away.
    distributed_action : bool (default: False)
        Distributes the attraction force evenly among nodes.
    strong_gravity : bool (default: False)
        Applies a strong gravitational pull towards the center.
    mass : dict or None, optional
        Maps nodes to their masses, influencing the attraction to other nodes.
    size : dict or None, optional
        Maps nodes to their sizes, preventing crowding by creating a halo effect.
    dissuade_hubs : bool (default: False)
        Prevents the clustering of hub nodes.
    linlog : bool (default: False)
        Uses logarithmic attraction instead of linear.
    seed : int, RandomState instance or None  optional (default=None)
        Used only for the initial positions in the algorithm.
        Set the random state for deterministic node layouts.
        If int, `seed` is the seed used by the random number generator,
        if numpy.random.RandomState instance, `seed` is the random
        number generator,
        if None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by numpy.random.
    dim : int (default: 2)
        Sets the dimensions for the layout. Ignored if `pos` is provided.
    store_pos_as : str, default None
        If non-None, the position of each node will be stored on the graph as
        an attribute with this string as its name, which can be accessed with
        ``G.nodes[...][store_pos_as]``. The function still returns the dictionary.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.florentine_families_graph()
    >>> pos = nx.forceatlas2_layout(G)
    >>> nx.draw(G, pos=pos)
    >>> # suppress the returned dict and store on the graph directly
    >>> pos = nx.forceatlas2_layout(G, store_pos_as="pos")
    >>> _ = nx.forceatlas2_layout(G, store_pos_as="pos")
