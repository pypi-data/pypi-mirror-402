    """Arf layout for networkx

    The attractive and repulsive forces (arf) layout [1] improves the spring
    layout in three ways. First, it prevents congestion of highly connected nodes
    due to strong forcing between nodes. Second, it utilizes the layout space
    more effectively by preventing large gaps that spring layout tends to create.
    Lastly, the arf layout represents symmetries in the layout better than the
    default spring layout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : np.ndarray
        Initial  position of  the nodes. The output will be stored in this variable.
    scaling : float
        Scales the radius of the circular layout space.
    a : float
        Strength of springs between connected nodes. Should be larger than 1.
        The greater a, the clearer the separation of unconnected sub clusters.
    etol : float
        Gradient sum of spring forces must be larger than `etol` before successful
        termination.
    dt : float
        Time step for force differential equation simulations.
    max_iter : int
        Max iterations before termination of the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
        None: positions are changed in place in pos.
