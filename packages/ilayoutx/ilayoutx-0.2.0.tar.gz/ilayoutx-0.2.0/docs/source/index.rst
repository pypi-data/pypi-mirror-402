# ilayoutx documentation

ilayoutx is a Python library for node layouting and edge routing in graphs. It natively
supports [networkx](https://networkx.org/), [igraph](https://python.igraph.org/), and
[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) networkx.

ilayoutx guarantees the **exact same layout and routing** independently of what library you used to construct the network/tree.
