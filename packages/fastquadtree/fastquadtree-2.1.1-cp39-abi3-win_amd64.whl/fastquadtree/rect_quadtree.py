    Spatial index for axis-aligned rectangles without object association.

    This class provides fast spatial indexing for rectangles using integer IDs that
    you can correlate with external data structures. For automatic object association,
    see `RectQuadTreeObjects`.

    Args:
        bounds: World bounds as (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y).
        capacity: Maximum rectangles per node before splitting.
        max_depth: Optional maximum tree depth (uses engine default if not specified).
        dtype: Coordinate data type ('f32', 'f64', 'i32', 'i64'). Default: 'f32'.

    Performance:
        - Inserts: O(log n) average
        - Queries: O(log n + k) average, where k is the number of matches
        - Nearest neighbor: O(log n) average

    Thread Safety:
        Not thread-safe. Use external synchronization for concurrent access.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If parameters are invalid or geometry is outside bounds.

    Example:
        ```python
        rqt = RectQuadTree((0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0), capacity=10)
        rect_id = rqt.insert((10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0))

            print(f"Rect {id_} at ({min_x}, {min_y}, {max_x}, {max_y})")
