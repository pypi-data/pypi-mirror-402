qt.insert((100, 200), id_=1)  # insert point with ID 1
print(qt.query((0, 0, 500, 500)))  # gets all points in that area: [(1, 100.0, 200.0)]
```

[^fqtnp]: Uses `query_np` for Numpy array return values rather than Python lists.  
[^fqt]: Uses standard `query` method returning Python lists.  
[^npreturn]: Uses Shapely STRtree with Numpy array points and returns.  
[^fqto]: Uses QuadTreeObjects with object association.

## API

[See the full API](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/quadtree/)

### `QuadTree(bounds, capacity, max_depth=None, dtype="f32")`

* `bounds` — tuple `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)` defines the 2D area covered by the quadtree
* `capacity` — max number of points kept in a leaf before splitting
* `max_depth` — optional depth cap. If omitted, the tree can keep splitting as needed
* `dtype` — data type for coordinates, e.g., `"f32"`, `"f64"`, `"i32"`, `"i64"`

### Key Methods

- `insert(xy, id_=None) -> int`

- `query(rect) -> list[tuple[int, float, float]]`

- `nearest_neighbor(xy) -> tuple[int, float, float] | None`

- `delete(id, x, y) -> bool`

For object tracking, use `QuadTreeObjects` instead. See the [docs](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/quadtree/) for more methods.

### Geometric conventions

* Rectangles are `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)`.
* Containment rule is closed on the min edge and open on the max edge
  `(x >= min_x and x < max_x and y >= min_y and y < max_y)`.
  This only matters for points exactly on edges.

## Performance tips

* Choose `capacity` so that leaves keep a small batch of points. Typical values are 8 to 64.
* If your data is very skewed, set a `max_depth` to prevent long chains.
* For fastest local runs, use `maturin develop --release`.
* Use `QuadTree` when you only need spatial indexing. Use `QuadTreeObjects` when you need to store Python objects with your points.
* Refer to the [Native vs Shim Benchmark](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/benchmark/#native-vs-shim-benchmark) for overhead details.

### Pygame Ball Pit Demo

![Ballpit_Demo_Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elan456/fastquadtree/main/assets/ballpit.png)

A simple demo of moving objects with collision detection using **fastquadtree**. 
You can toggle between fastquadtree, pyqtree, and brute-force mode to see the performance difference.
I typically see an FPS of ~70 with fastquadtree, ~25 with pyqtree, and <1 FPS with brute-force on my machine with 1500 balls. 

See the [runnables guide](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/runnables/) for setup instructions.

## FAQ

**Can I delete items from the quadtree?**
Yes! Use `delete(id, x, y)` to remove specific items. You must provide both the ID and exact location for precise deletion. This handles cases where multiple items exist at the same location. If you're using `QuadTreeObjects`, you can also use `delete_by_object(obj)` for convenient object-based deletion with O(1) lookup. The tree automatically merges nodes when item counts drop below capacity.

**Can I store rectangles or circles?**
Yes, you can store rectangles using the `RectQuadTree` class. Circles can be approximated with bounding boxes. See the [RectQuadTree docs](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/rect_quadtree/) for details.

**Do I need NumPy installed?**
No, NumPy is a fully optional dependency. If you do have NumPy installed, you can use methods such as `query_np` and `insert_many_np` for better performance. Note that `insert_many` raises `TypeError` on NumPy input—you must use `insert_many_np` explicitly for NumPy arrays. The Rust core is able to handle NumPy arrays faster than Python lists, so there's a lot of time savings in utilizing the NumPy functions. See the [Native vs Shim benchmark](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/benchmark/#native-vs-shim) for details on how returing NumPy arrays can speed up queries.

```python
# Using Python lists
qt.insert_many([(10, 20), (30, 40), (50, 60)])

# Using NumPy arrays (requires NumPy)
import numpy as np
points = np.array([[10, 20], [30, 40], [50, 60]])
qt.insert_many_np(points)  # Use insert_many_np for NumPy arrays
```

**Does fastquadtree support multiprocessing?**
Yes, fastquadtree objects can be serialized to bytes using the `to_bytes()` method and deserialized back using `from_bytes()`. This allows you to share quadtree data across processes and even cache prebuilt trees to disk. When using `QuadTreeObjects` or `RectQuadTreeObjects`, you must pass `include_objects=True` to `to_bytes()` to serialize Python objects, and `allow_objects=True` to `from_bytes()` when loading. By default, objects are skipped for safety, as deserializing untrusted Python objects can be unsafe. See the [interactive v2 demo](https://github.com/Elan456/fastquadtree/blob/main/interactive/interactive_v2.py) for an example of saving and loading a quadtree, and the [QuadTreeObjects API docs](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/quadtree_objects/#fastquadtree.QuadTreeObjects.to_bytes) for full details on the serialization methods.
