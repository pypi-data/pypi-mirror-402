   Marketing site layout for LightWave domains.

   Extends the base layout with marketing-specific defaults:
   - React header island with navigation
   - React footer island with company info
   - Messages display

   {% extends "lightwave/layouts/site.html" %}
#}

{% block messages %}
    {# Override to include domain-specific messages component #}
{% endblock messages %}
