{% extends "lightwave/layouts/base.html" %}
{#
   Application layout for logged-in users.

   Extends the base layout with app-specific defaults:
   - Different navigation (app nav instead of marketing nav)
   - Sidebar layout option
   - User context available

   Domains should override blocks as needed:
   {% extends "lightwave/layouts/app.html" %}
#}

{% block top_nav %}
    {# Override to include app-specific navigation #}
{% endblock top_nav %}

{% block footer %}
    {# App layouts typically don't have marketing footer #}
{% endblock footer %}
