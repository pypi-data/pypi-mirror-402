Code
----

The code is available `on GitHub
<https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar>`_. Unfortunately, the
repository contains old and flawed objects, so if you have set
`fetch.fsckObjects
<https://github.com/git/git/blob/0afbf6caa5b16dcfa3074982e5b48e27d452dbbb/Documentation/config.txt#L1381>`_
you'll have to deactivate it for this repository::

    git clone --config fetch.fsckobjects=false https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar.git

Once you've obtained a checkout, you should create a virtualenv_ and install
the libraries required for working on the Debug Toolbar::

    $ python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

You can run now run the example application::

    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=example.settings python -m django migrate
    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=example.settings python -m django runserver

For convenience, there's an alias for the second command::

    $ make example

The default password is ``p``, it can be overridden by setting the environment
variable ``DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD``.

Look at ``example/settings.py`` for running the example with another database
than SQLite.

Architecture
------------

There is high-level information on how the Django Debug Toolbar is structured
in the :doc:`architecture documentation <architecture>`.

Tests
-----

Once you've set up a development environment as explained above, you can run
the test suite for the versions of Django and Python installed in that
environment using the SQLite database::

    $ make test

You can enable coverage measurement during tests::

    $ make coverage

You can also run the test suite on all supported versions of Django and
Python::

    $ tox

This is strongly recommended before committing changes to Python code.

The test suite includes frontend tests written with Selenium. Since they're
annoyingly slow, they're disabled by default. You can run them as follows::

    $ make test_selenium

or by setting the ``DJANGO_SELENIUM_TESTS`` environment variable::

    $ DJANGO_SELENIUM_TESTS=true make test
    $ DJANGO_SELENIUM_TESTS=true make coverage
    $ DJANGO_SELENIUM_TESTS=true tox

Note that by default, ``tox`` enables the Selenium tests for a single test
environment.  To run the entire ``tox`` test suite with all Selenium tests
disabled, run the following::

    $ DJANGO_SELENIUM_TESTS= tox

To test via ``tox`` against other databases, you'll need to create the user,
database and assign the proper permissions. For PostgreSQL in a ``psql``
shell (note this allows the debug_toolbar user the permission to create
databases)::

    psql> CREATE USER debug_toolbar WITH PASSWORD 'debug_toolbar';
    psql> ALTER USER debug_toolbar CREATEDB;
    psql> CREATE DATABASE debug_toolbar;
    psql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE debug_toolbar to debug_toolbar;

For MySQL/MariaDB in a ``mysql`` shell::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE debug_toolbar;
    mysql> CREATE USER 'debug_toolbar'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'debug_toolbar';
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON debug_toolbar.* TO 'debug_toolbar'@'localhost';
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test_debug_toolbar.* TO 'debug_toolbar'@'localhost';


Style
-----

The Django Debug Toolbar uses `ruff <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/>`__ to
format and lint Python code. The toolbar uses `pre-commit
<https://pre-commit.com>`__ to automatically apply our style guidelines when a
commit is made. Set up pre-commit before committing with::

    $ pre-commit install

If necessary you can bypass pre-commit locally with::

    $ git commit --no-verify

Note that it runs on CI.

To reformat the code manually use::

    $ pre-commit run --all-files


Typing
------

The Debug Toolbar has been accepting patches which add type hints to the code
base, as long as the types themselves do not cause any problems or obfuscate
the intent.

The maintainers are not committed to adding type hints and are not requiring
new code to have type hints at this time. This may change in the future.


Patches
-------

Please submit `pull requests
<https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar/pulls>`_!

The Debug Toolbar includes a limited but growing test suite. If you fix a bug
or add a feature code, please consider adding proper coverage in the test
suite, especially if it has a chance for a regression.

Translations
------------

Translation efforts are coordinated on `Transifex
<https://explore.transifex.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar/>`_.

Help translate the Debug Toolbar in your language!

Mailing list
------------

This project doesn't have a mailing list at this time. If you wish to discuss
a topic, please open an issue on GitHub.

Making a release
----------------

Prior to a release, the English ``.po`` file must be updated with ``make
translatable_strings`` and pushed to Transifex. Once translators have done
their job, ``.po`` files must be downloaded with ``make update_translations``.

You will need to
`install the Transifex CLI <https://developers.transifex.com/docs/cli>`_.

To publish a release you have to be a `django-debug-toolbar project lead at
Django Commons <https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar>`__.

The release itself requires the following steps:

#. Update supported Python and Django versions:

   - ``pyproject.toml`` options ``requires-python``, ``dependencies``,
     and ``classifiers``
   - ``README.rst``

   Commit.

#. Update the screenshot in ``README.rst``.

   .. code-block:: console

       $ make example/django-debug-toolbar.png

   Commit.

#. Bump version numbers in ``docs/changes.rst``, ``docs/conf.py``,
   ``README.rst``, and ``debug_toolbar/__init__.py``.
   Add the release date to ``docs/changes.rst``. Commit.

#. Tag the new version.

#. Push the commit and the tag.

#. Publish the release from the GitHub actions workflow.

#. **After the publishing completed** edit the automatically created GitHub
   release to include the release notes (you may use GitHub's "Generate release
   notes" button for this).


Building the documentation locally
----------------------------------

The project's documentation is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.
You can generate it locally to preview your changes before submitting a pull
request.


Prerequisites
--------------

Before building the documentation, ensure that all dependencies are installed
as described in :ref:`the setup instructions <code>`.

Additionally, to build the documentation with proper spell checking,
you need to install:

- **Enchant Library** - This is required by the sphinxcontrib-spelling
        extension via the pyenchant package. For detailed installation
        instructions, see the
        `pyenchant installation documentation <https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html#installing-the-enchant-c-library>`_.




Using Tox (Cross-Platform)
------------------------------------

To build the documentation using Tox, run from the project root:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e docs -- html

This will generate the HTML files in ``docs/_build/html/``.

You can then open the documentation in your browser:

- **Linux:** ``xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html``
- **macOS:** ``open docs/_build/html/index.html``
- **Windows:** ``start docs\_build\html\index.html``

*Tox automatically installs the necessary dependencies, so you don’t need
to activate a virtual environment manually.*


Troubleshooting
----------------


If you encounter an error about a missing dependency such as
``sphinx-build: command not found``, ensure that your virtual environment is
activated and all dependencies are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

Alternatively, you can build the documentation using Tox, which automatically
handles dependencies and environment setup:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e docs -- html
