## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🔍 LTP Near Gaps
Detects significant price gaps (bullish and bearish) and identifies stocks currently trading near these unfilled gap zones—prime areas for potential support or resistance.

### 2. 🧱 Fractal Support & Resistance
Uses vectorized fractal detection to identify statistically significant price levels. It calculates level strength based on historical touches and proximity.

### 3. 🕯️ Candle & Gap Analysis
Provides a statistical breakdown of recent price action:
- Green/Red/Doji distribution.
- Open = High / Open = Low detection.
- Sustained gap performance.

### 4. 🧬 Fibonacci Retracement Levels
Automates the plotting of Fibonacci levels from recent swing highs and lows, highlighting stocks trading near key levels like the 50% or 61.8% "Golden Ratio."

### 5. 📉 Chart Pattern Detection
Vectorized detection of major classical patterns:
- **Reversals:** Double Top/Bottom, Head & Shoulders (Regular/Inverse).
- **Continuation:** Falling/Rising Wedges, Ascending/Descending/Symmetrical Triangles.
- **Trend Channels:** Ascending and Descending channels.

## 🚦 Quick Start

### 1. Configure your Scan
Open `run_analysis.py` at the root. You can easily modify:
- **Ticker Groups:** NSE indices, NIFTY 500, Custom lists.
- **Periods:** Change scan duration (e.g., `1y`, `2y`).
- **Tolerances:** Fine-tune how "near" a level a stock must be.

### 2. Run the Analysis
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

## 💾 Intelligent Caching
This suite features a **smart slicing cache**. If you've fetched 1 year of data, running a 1-month candle analysis will be **instantaneous**, as it slices the existing local data rather than re-downloading.

## 📊 Outputs
Results are neatly organized in the `outputs/` folder:
- **Gaps Result:** Detailed CSV of unfilled gaps.
- **Support_Resistance:** High-resolution charts with plotted levels.
- **Fibonacci:** CSV and charts showing retracement proximity.
- **Chart_Patterns:** Identified breakout/reversal opportunities.
- **Candle_Analysis:** Summary reports of price action statistics.
