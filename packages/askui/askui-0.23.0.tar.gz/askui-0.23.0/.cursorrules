# Code Style
- Use `_` prefix for all private variables, constants, functions, methods, properties, etc. that don't need to be accessible from outside the module
- Mark everything as private that does not absolutely need to be accessible from outside the module
- Use `@override` (imported from `typing_extensions`) decorator for all methods that override a parent class method
- Use type hints for all variables, functions, methods, properties, return values, parameters etc.
- Omit `Any` within type hints unless absolutely necessary
- Use built-in types (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`, `str | None`) instead of types from `typing` module (e.g. `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Set`, `Optional`, `Union`) wherever possible
- Instead of `Optional` use `| None`
- Create a `__init__.py` file in each folder
- Never pass literals, e.g., `error_msg`, directly to `Exceptions`, but instead assign them to variables and pass them to the exception, e.g., `raise FileNotFoundError(error_msg)` instead of `raise FileNotFoundError(f"Thread {thread_id} not found")`
- Always specify `encoding="utf-8"` for all file read and write operations (e.g., `Path.read_text()`, `Path.write_text()`, `open()`, etc.) to ensure proper handling of Unicode characters across all platforms

## FastAPI
- Instead of defining `response_model` within route annotation, use the model as the response type in the function signature
- Do not assign `None` to dependencies but instead move it before arguments with default values

# Testing
- Use `pytest-mock` for mocking in tests wherever you need to mock something and pytest-mock can do the job.

# Git
- Never use `git add .` - always explicitly add files that are related to the task using `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
- Use conventional commits format for commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- Always run linting/pdm commands before committing to ensure code quality. The following commands must pass:
  - `pdm run format` - code formatting with ruff (must pass)
  - `pdm run lint` - linting with ruff (must pass, or use `pdm run lint:fix` to auto-fix issues)
  - `pdm run typecheck:all` - type checking with mypy (may have pre-existing errors from venv/optional dependencies, but should not introduce new errors)
  - Alternatively, use `pdm run qa:fix` which runs `typecheck:all`, `format`, and `lint:fix`

# Documentation

## Docstrings
- All public functions, constants, classes, types etc. should have docstrings
- Document the constructor (`__init__`) args as part of the class docstring
- Omit the `__init__` docstring
- All function parameter should be documented with their type (followed by `, optional` if there is a default value) in parenthesis and description
- In descriptions, use backticks for all code references (variables, types, etc.), including types, e.g., `str`
- When referencing a function, use the function name in backticks plus parentheses, e.g., `click()`
- When referencing a class, use the class name in backticks, e.g., `VisionAgent`
- When referencing a method, use the class name in backticks plus the method name in parentheses, e.g., `VisionAgent.click()`
- When referencing a class attribute, use the class name in backticks plus the attribute name, e.g., `VisionAgent.display`
- Use `Example` section for code examples
- Use `Returns` section for return values
- Use `Raises` section for exceptions listing all possible exceptions that can be raised by the function
- Use `Notes` section for additional notes
- Use `See Also` section for related functions
- Use `References` section for references
- Use `Examples` section for code examples
- Example of a good docstring:
  ```python
  def locate(
      self,
      locator: str | Locator,
      screenshot: InputSource | None = None,
      model: ModelComposition | str | None = None,
  ) -> Point:
      """
      Find the position of the UI element identified by the `locator` using the `model`.

      Args:
          locator (str | Locator): The identifier or description of the element to locate.
          screenshot (InputSource | None, optional): The screenshot to use for locating the
              element. Can be a path to an image file, a PIL Image object or a data URL.
              If `None`, takes a screenshot of the currently selected screen.
          model (ModelComposition | str | None, optional): The composition or name of
              the model(s) to be used for locating the element using the `locator`.

      Returns:
          Point: The coordinates of a point on the element, usually the center of the element, as a tuple (x, y).

      Raises:
          ValueError: If the arguments are not of the correct type.
          ElementNotFoundError: If no element can be found.

      Example:
          ```python
          from askui import VisionAgent

          with VisionAgent() as agent:
              point = agent.locate("Submit button")
              print(f"Element found at coordinates: {point}")
          ```
      """
      ...
  ```
