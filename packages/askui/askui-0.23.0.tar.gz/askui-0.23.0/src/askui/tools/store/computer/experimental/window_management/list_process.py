            This tool is used as the first step in window management workflows to
            discover available applications and obtain their process IDs. Use this
            tool when you need to find a specific application or see what
            applications are currently running with windows. The tool returns a list
            of process names and their corresponding process IDs. After obtaining a
            process ID, you can use list_process_windows_tool to see all windows
            belonging to that process, or use set_window_in_focus_tool or
            add_window_as_virtual_display_tool to interact with specific windows.
