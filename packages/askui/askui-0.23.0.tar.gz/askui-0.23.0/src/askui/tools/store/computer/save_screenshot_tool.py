class ComputerSaveScreenshotTool(ComputerBaseTool):
    """
    Tool for saving screenshots from the currently connected computer to disk.

    This tool captures a screenshot of the current computer screen and saves
    it to a specified location on the filesystem. The screenshot is saved as a PNG
    image file. The directory structure will be created automatically if it doesn't
    exist.

    Args:
        base_dir (str): The base directory path where screenshots will be saved.
            All screenshot paths will be relative to this directory.

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.computer import ComputerSaveScreenshotTool

        with VisionAgent() as agent:
            agent.act(

                tools=[ComputerSaveScreenshotTool(base_dir="/path/to/screenshots")]
            )
        ```

    Example
    ```python
    from askui import VisionAgent
    from askui.tools.store.computer import ComputerSaveScreenshotTool

    with VisionAgent(
        act_tools=[ComputerSaveScreenshotTool(base_dir="/path/to/screenshots")]
