class WriteToFileTool(Tool):
    """
    Tool for writing content to files on the filesystem.

    This tool allows the agent to save text content to files, creating the
    necessary directory structure automatically if it doesn't exist. It supports
    both overwrite and append modes, making it useful for logging, saving results,
    creating reports, or storing any text-based data during execution.

    Args:
        base_dir (str): The base directory path where files will be written.
            All file paths will be relative to this directory. The base directory
            will be created if it doesn't exist.

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import WriteToFileTool

        with VisionAgent() as agent:
            agent.act(
                "Extract the text from the page and save it to results/output.txt",
                tools=[WriteToFileTool(base_dir="/path/to/output")]
            )
        ```

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import WriteToFileTool

        with VisionAgent(
            act_tools=[WriteToFileTool(base_dir="/path/to/logs")]
        ) as agent:
            agent.act("Log the current state to logs/execution.log with append mode")
