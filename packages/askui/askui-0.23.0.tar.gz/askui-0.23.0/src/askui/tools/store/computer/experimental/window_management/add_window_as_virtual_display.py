            Converts a specific window into a virtual display and assigns it a
            unique display ID. This tool is essential for automating windows that
            are not the primary display or when you need to automate a specific
            window in a multi-window application. After adding a window as a
            virtual display, you can use the returned display ID to target that
            specific window for automation tasks using computer_tool or other
            automation tools.

            Typical workflow:
            1. Use list_process_tool to find the process ID of the target
               application
            2. Use list_process_windows_tool to find the window ID of the
               specific window
            3. Optionally use set_window_in_focus_tool to bring the window to
               the front
            4. Use this tool to add the window as a virtual display and obtain
               its display ID
            5. Use the returned display ID with automation tools to interact
               with that window

            Requires: A valid process ID (from list_process_tool), a valid
            window ID (from list_process_windows_tool), and the window name (for
            identification purposes). The window ID must belong to the specified
            process ID.
            Returns: A message containing the assigned display ID, which should
            be used to target this window in subsequent automation operations.
