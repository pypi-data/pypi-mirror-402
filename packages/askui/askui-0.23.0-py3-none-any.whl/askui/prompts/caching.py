    "    You can use precomputed trajectories to make the execution of the "
    "task more robust and faster!\n"
    "    To do so, first use the RetrieveCachedTestExecutions tool to check "
    "which trajectories are available for you.\n"
    "    The details what each trajectory that is available for you does are "
    "at the end of this prompt.\n"
    "    A trajectory contains all necessary mouse movements, clicks, and "
    "typing actions from a previously successful execution.\n"
    "    If there is a trajectory available for a step you need to take, "
    "always use it!\n"
    "    You can execute a trajectory with the ExecuteCachedExecution tool.\n"
    "    After a trajectory was executed, make sure to verify the results! "
    "While it works most of the time, occasionally, the execution can be "
    "(partly) incorrect. So make sure to verify if everything is filled out "
    "as expected, and make corrections where necessary!\n"
