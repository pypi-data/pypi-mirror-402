            Lists all windows belonging to a specific process identified by its
            process ID. This tool is used after list_process_tool to discover all
            windows within a particular application. Use this tool when you need to
            see what windows are available for a specific process, such as when an
            application has multiple windows (main window, dialogs, popups, etc.).
            The tool returns the window names and window IDs for each window
            belonging to the specified process. After obtaining a window ID, you
            can use set_window_in_focus_tool to bring that window to the front, or
            add_window_as_virtual_display_tool to add it as a virtual display for
            automation.

            Requires: A valid process ID obtained from list_process_tool.
            Returns: A formatted string listing all windows for the specified
            process, including window name and window ID for each window.
