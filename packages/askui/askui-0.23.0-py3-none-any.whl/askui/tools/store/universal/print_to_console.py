class PrintToConsoleTool(Tool):
    """
    Tool for printing messages to the console to communicate with the user.

    This tool allows the agent to provide real-time updates, status information,
    progress notifications, or any other messages directly to the user's console
    output. It is particularly useful for keeping users informed about the current
    state of execution, intermediate results, or important notifications during
    long-running operations.

    Args:
        source_name (str | None, optional): An optional prefix to prepend to all
            printed messages. If provided, messages will be formatted as
            "[source_name]: content". This helps identify the source of messages
            when multiple tools or components are printing to the console.

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import PrintToConsoleTool

        with VisionAgent() as agent:
            agent.act(
                "Click the login button and print a status message",
                tools=[PrintToConsoleTool(source_name="Agent")]
            )
