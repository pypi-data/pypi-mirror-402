A python packaged version of our software NApy. NApy offers a fast python tool providing statistical tests and effect sizes for a more comprehensive and informative analysis of mixed type data in the presence of missingness. Written both in C++ and numba and parallelized with OpenMP.

## Installation

NApy is available as a Python package on the most common Windows, MacOS, and Linux architectures (64-bit only). It is easily installable via:

```bash
pip install napypi
```

## Documentation

For a detailed overview of NApy's functionality and parameter descriptions, we refer to NApy's [main repository](https://github.com/DyHealthNet/NApy).
