# nicett6

An asyncio based package to talk to a Nice TT6 control unit for tubular motors using the RS-232 protocol

The Nice TT6 control unit is used to control projector screens, garage doors, awnings and blinds.   It is white labelled by Screen Research as the MCS-N-12V-RS232 projector screen controller and by Beamax as the 11299 projector screen controller.

See [this document](https://www.niceforyou.com/sites/default/files/upload/manuals/IS0064A00MM.pdf) for the protocol definition

Known to work with a GANA USB to RS-232 DB9 cable on Windows 10 and on Raspbian Stretch

# Basic Control API

## Opening a connection

`nicett6.tt6_connection.open([serial_port])` opens a connection to the TT6 controlled connected to `serial_port`

`nicett6.tt6_connection.open_connection([serial_port])` opens a connection and acts as an async context manager

If `serial_port` is not supplied or is `None` then an intelligent guess will be made as to the right parameter depending on the platform

The serial_port parameter can be anything that can be passed to `serial.serial_for_url()`.  E.g.

* `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux)
* `COM3` (Windows)
* `socket://192.168.0.100:50000` (if you are using a TCP/IP to serial  converter)

Returns a `TT6Connection`

Example:

```python
    async with open_connection(serial_port) as conn:
        tt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)
        writer = conn.get_writer()
        await writer.send_hex_move_command(tt_addr, 0xE0)
```

## TT6Connection

A class that allows multiple readers and writers to a single serial connection.

The lifecycle of the connection is managed by the client as opposed to closing upon receipt of an EOF from the device.
If the connection is disconnected by either end then readers wait for the next message and writers will discard any messages sent.
Once the connection is re-connected then normal service resumes.  The client can terminate the connection by calling `close()`.

See [Opening a connection](#opening-a-connection) for information on opening a connection.

Property|Description
--|--
`is_connected`|Indicates whether the connection is connected

Method|Description
--|--
`connect()`|Establish or re-establish the connection.
`disconnect()`|Break the connection but do not stop any readers or writers.
`close()`|Stop and remove all readers (they will stop iterating).   Disconnect.
`add_reader()`|Returns a new reader object.<br>If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Reader` object.<br>The serial connection retains a weak reference to the reader in order to keep it updated.  A reader that is no longer needed can either be dereferenced or explicitly removed.
`remove_reader(reader)`|Stops the `reader` object from receiving any further messages
`get_writer()`|Returns a new writer object.   If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Writer` object.<br>The base class manages contention between multiple potential clients of the same connection.<br>Writer objects do not take any resources and can simply be dereferenced when finished with
`process_request(coro, [time_window])`|Send a command and collect the response messages that arrive in time_window

## TTBusDeviceAddress

A simple class that represents the address of a TTBus device - to be used for `tt_addr` paramters

Supports comparison with other objects of the same class

Can be used as a key in a mapping type

Property|Description
--|--
`address`|the address of the device on the TTBus
`node`|the device node (usually 0x04)
`as_tuple`|a tuple of `(address, node)`

<br>

Example:

```python
tt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)
```

## TT6Reader

A reader that will collect all decoded messages received on the `TT6Connection` in a queue until it is removed

A `TT6Reader` is an asynchronous iterator returning [response message objects](#Response-message-classes)

Usage:

```python
    async for msg in reader:
        # Do something with msg
```

## Response message classes

`send_hex_move_command(tt_addr, hex_pos)`|Instruct the controller to move the TTBus device at `tt_addr` to `hex_pos`<br>`hex_pos` is a value between 0x00 (fully down) and 0xFF (fully up)

## TT6Cover

Class that sends commands to a `Cover` that is connected to the TTBus

Intended to be constructed by `CoverManager.add_cover()`

Property|Description
--|--
`tt_addr`|the TTBus address of the Cover
`cover`|the `Cover` helper
`writer`|the low level `TT6Writer`

Method|Description

`send_simple_command(cmd_name)`|Send a [simple command](#command-codes) to the controller for the Cover

## PostMovementNotifier

Helper class that resets a cover to idle after movement has stopped

Documented here for completeness but intended to be constructed by and internal to the `Cover`

Most state changes of a `Cover` will be triggered by the receipt of a POS message.  The `Cover` infers that there is movement when a message is received and infers the direction from the current and previous message.   However, there is no notification that the `Cover` is idle so the `PostMovementNotifier` class detects that there has been no movement for a period and then calls `Cover.set_idle()`.  The `Cover` will then notify its observers that it is idle.

Whenever the `Cover` moves, there is a call to `Cover.moved()` which calls `PostMovementNotifier.moved()`.  A task is created that will wait for a period and then set the `Cover` to idle.   If a task was already running when the movement notification is received then the task will be cancelled and restarted.

The task must sleep for `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL + PostMovementNotifier.POST_MOVEMENT_ALLOWANCE` seconds without being cancelled for the `Cover` to be considered idle.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        config filename

A sample `config.json` file is provided in the `emulator/config` folder

Sample config:

```json
{
    "web_on": false,
    "covers": [
        {
            "address": 2,
            "node": 4,
            "name": "screen",
            "step_len": 0.01,
            "max_drop": 1.77,
            "speed": 0.08
        },

            "max_drop": 0.6,
            "speed": 0.08
        }
    ]
}
```

# Examples

The following examples can be used in conjunction with the [Emulator](#Emulator)

* `example2.py` - shows how to use the [Basic Control API](#Basic-Control-API)
* `example3.py` - shows how to use the [High Level Cover API](#High-Level-Cover-API)

# Utilities

## Movement Timing Logger

The script `movement_timing_logger.py` can be used to see how often the controller publishes POS messages as it moves.   It will move the specified Cover down and then back up and log the time between messages.   This can be used to tune `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL` so that `Cover.is_moving` is accurate.

```
usage: movement_timing_logger.py [-h] [-s SERIAL_PORT] [-a {2,3}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SERIAL_PORT, --serial_port SERIAL_PORT
                        serial port
  -a {2,3}, --address {2,3}
                        device address
```

# Notes

## End of Line (EOL) characters

The protocol definition specifies that all messages end in a carriage return character but in practice the controller seems to use carriage return plus line feed.

For convenience the API can handle either.

* The API will write to the controller with messages ending in carriage return
* The API will handle messages from the controller with either line ending
* The emulator will handle inbound commands with either line ending
* The emulator will send responses ending in carriage return and line feed

## Measurement units

This document refers to metres as the unit of measurement for all absolute measurements but you can use mm, cm, inches or feet as long as you are consistent
