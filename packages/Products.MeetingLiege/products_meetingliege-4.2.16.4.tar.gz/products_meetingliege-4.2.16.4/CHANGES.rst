4.2.2 (2022-05-03)

------------------

- Adapted `Migrate_To_4200._migrateItemsWorkflowHistory` to update `MeetingConfigs`
  before `workflow_history` and to call `BaseMigrator.updateWFStatesAndTransitions`
  with `update_local_roles=False` as it is done by the main migrator just after.
  [gbastien]
- Fixed `CustomMeetingItem.getLegalTextForFDAdvice` to be sure that everything is
  `utf-8` to avoid `UnicodeDecodeError` as now `RichTextValue.output` returns `unicode`.
  [gbastien]
- Make sure suffixes `administrativereviewers`, `internalreviewers` and
  `reviewers` have access to the item in the `Council`, as items come validated,
  need to configure the `itemcreated` item WF validation level `extra_suffixes`.
  [gbastien]
- Implemented `MeetingConfig._custom_reviewersFor` to manage `reviewersFor` the
  `Bourgmestre MeetingConfig` because suffix `creators` is used at several levels
  in MeetingConfig.itemWFValidationLevels and this breaks `MeetingConfig._highestReviewerLevel`.
  [gbastien]
- Fixed `ItemWfHistoryAdapter.mayViewComment` to show comment to the
  `MeetingItem.financeAdvice` advisers group for `backToProposedToInternalReviewer`
  action if `previous_review_state` was `proposed_to_finance_waiting_advices`.
