# TOPSIS Python Package

📌 About TOPSIS

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method.
It helps in ranking alternatives based on their distance from the ideal best and ideal worst solutions.

This package provides a command-line implementation of TOPSIS in Python.

📦 Installation

Install the package from PyPI using:

```bash
pip install Topsis-Vansh-102303641
```

🚀 Usage

The package can be used directly from the command line.

🔹 Command Format

```text
topsis <inputFileName> <weights> <impacts> <outputFileName>
```

🔹 Example

```bash
topsis data.csv "1,1,1,2" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

📄 Input File Format

The first column should contain the names of alternatives.

From second column to last column, values must be numeric.

The file must contain at least 3 columns.

✔ Example Input (data.csv)

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6
M2,0.6,0.36,3.6,53.3
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1
M4,0.6,0.36,3.5,69.2
```

📤 Output File Format

The output file will contain two additional columns:

- Topsis Score
- Rank

✔ Example Output (result.csv)

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4,Topsis Score,Rank
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6,0.61,2
M2,0.6,0.36,3.6,53.3,0.42,4
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1,0.78,1
M4,0.6,0.36,3.5,69.2,0.35,5
```

⚠️ Error Handling

The program checks for the following errors:

- Incorrect number of command-line arguments
- Input file not found
- Less than 3 columns in input file
- Non-numeric values in criteria columns
- Number of weights, impacts, and criteria mismatch
- Impacts other than + or -
- Weights and impacts not separated by commas

Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.

🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
