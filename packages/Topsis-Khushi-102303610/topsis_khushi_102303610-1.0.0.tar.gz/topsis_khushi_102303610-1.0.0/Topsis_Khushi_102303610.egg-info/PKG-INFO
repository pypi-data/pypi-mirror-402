# TOPSIS â€” Khushi (102303610)

**Topsis-Khushi-102303610** is a Python library for solving **Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** problems using the **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**.

---

## What is TOPSIS?

**TOPSIS** is a decision-making method used when you need to choose the best option from several alternatives based on multiple criteria.

### Core Concept

The best alternative should have:
- The **shortest distance** from the **Positive Ideal Solution** (best possible values)
- The **longest distance** from the **Negative Ideal Solution** (worst possible values)

### Simple Example

Imagine choosing a mutual fund based on:
- **P1** (higher is better) âœ“
- **P2** (higher is better) âœ“
- **P3** (lower is better) âœ—
- **P4** (higher is better) âœ“

TOPSIS calculates a score for each fund and ranks them to help you pick the best one!

---

## Features

- âœ… Simple command-line interface
- âœ… Handles any number of alternatives and criteria
- âœ… Automatic normalization of data
- âœ… Supports both beneficial (+) and non-beneficial (-) criteria
- âœ… Generates ranked output with TOPSIS scores
- âœ… Easy to install and use

---

## Installation

Install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Topsis-Khushi-102303610
```

---

## Usage

Run TOPSIS from the command line:

```bash
topsis <InputFile.csv> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputFile.csv>
```

### Method 1: With Quotes (Recommended)

```bash
topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

### Method 2: Without Quotes

```bash
topsis data.csv 1,1,1,1 +,+,-,+ result.csv
```

**Important:**  
Method 2 does not allow spaces. Always use quotes if there are spaces in your input.

### Get Help

```bash
topsis -h
```

---

## Input File Format

The input must be a **CSV file** with the following structure:

### Requirements

- **First column**: Names or IDs of alternatives (text)
- **Remaining columns**: Numerical criteria values only
- **First row**: Column headers

### Example: `data.csv`

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6
M2,0.6,0.36,3.6,53.3
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1
M4,0.6,0.36,3.5,69.2
```

**Where:**
- `Fund Name` = Name of the mutual fund
- `P1, P2, P3, P4` = Different performance criteria to evaluate

---

## Example

### Input File: `data.csv`

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6
M2,0.6,0.36,3.6,53.3
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1
M4,0.6,0.36,3.5,69.2
```

### Command

```bash
topsis data.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "+,+,-,+" output.csv
```

### Parameters Explained

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Weights** | `0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25` | All criteria have equal importance (25% each) |
| **Impacts** | `+,+,-,+` | P1 âœ“, P2 âœ“, P3 âœ—, P4 âœ“ |

**Impacts:**
- `+` means **higher is better** (beneficial)
- `-` means **lower is better** (non-beneficial)

### Output: `output.csv`

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4,Topsis Score,Rank
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6,0.448532,3
M2,0.6,0.36,3.6,53.3,0.532891,2
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1,0.691876,1
M4,0.6,0.36,3.5,69.2,0.589247,2
```

**Result:** Fund **M3** is ranked **1st** (best choice) with the highest TOPSIS Score.

## Input Validation Rules

The package validates your input to ensure correctness:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| âœ“ File format | Must be a `.csv` file |
| âœ“ Minimum alternatives | At least 2 rows of data |
| âœ“ Minimum criteria | At least 2 criteria columns |
| âœ“ Numeric values | All criteria values must be numbers |
| âœ“ Matching counts | Number of weights = Number of impacts = Number of criteria |
| âœ“ Valid impacts | Only `+` or `-` allowed |
| âœ“ Positive weights | All weights must be > 0 |

---

## How TOPSIS Works (Algorithm)

1. **Normalize** the decision matrix
2. Calculate the **weighted normalized** matrix
3. Determine the **Ideal Best** (positive ideal solution)
4. Determine the **Ideal Worst** (negative ideal solution)
5. Calculate **Euclidean distances** from ideal best and worst
6. Compute **TOPSIS performance score** for each alternative
7. **Rank** alternatives (1 = best)

## Error Handling

Common errors and solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| File not found | Wrong file path | Check the file name and path |
| Wrong number of parameters | Mismatch in counts | Ensure weights, impacts, and criteria match |
| Non-numeric values | Text in criteria columns | All criteria must be numbers (except first column) |
| Invalid impact | Wrong symbol used | Use only `+` or `-` |
| Invalid weights | Zero or negative weight | All weights must be positive numbers |
