.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fIbob clean\fP command removes workspace directories from previous
\fI\%bob\-dev\fP and \fI\%bob\-build\fP invocations that are not referenced anymore
by the current recipes. It can also remove attic directories that are wasting
precious disk space.
.sp
The command has several modes of operation. By default develop mode related
workspaces are garbage collected. In release mode (\fB\-\-release\fP) workspaces
that were created by \fIbob build\fP are cleaned. Giving the \fB\-\-attic\fP option
removes attic directories that were created by \fIbob dev\fP\&. Lastly the
\fB\-\-shared\fP option will cleanup the optionally configured \fI\%shared package
location\fP\&.
.sp
The identification of the unreferenced workspace directories is based on the
current recipes, user configuration files and environment definitions. You
should therefore pass the same options to \fIbob clean\fP (\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-D\fP) that you
would also pass to \fIbob build\fP resp. \fIbob dev\fP\&. If in doubt use \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP
to see what would be deleted.
.sp
Workspaces that hold source code are never deleted by default. Add the \fB\-s\fP
option to consider these workspace directories too. Bob will still check each
SCM in an unreferenced workspace for modifications.  If the SCM checkout has
been modified in any way (e.g. changed or untracked files, unpushed commits)
then the workspace is kept. Use \fB\-f\fP to also delete such workspaces too.
.sp
In contrast to the other modes the \fB\-\-shared\fP option does not work on the
project directory itself but the shared packages location. If no quota was
configured the command will do nothing by default. Otherwise all \fIunused\fP
packages will be removed (from oldest usage to newest) until the quota is met.
If no unused packages are remaining (i.e. all other packages are still
referenced by a project workspace) the quota could still be exceeded. To remove
older packages too in such a case, add the \fB\-\-used\fP option. To remove \fIall\fP
unused packages, regardless of the quota, use the \fB\-\-all\-unused\fP option.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-develop\fP
Clean develop mode (\fIbob dev\fP) directories. This is the default.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-release\fP
Clean release mode (\fIbob build\fP) directories.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-attic\fP
Remove attic directories.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-shared\fP
Delete packages from shared location.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-c CONFIGFILE\fP
Use additional user configuration file. May be given more than once.
.sp
The configuration files have the same syntax as \fBdefault.yaml\fP\&. Their
settings have higher precedence than \fBdefault.yaml\fP, with the last given
configuration file being the highest.
.TP
.B \fB\-D VAR[=VALUE]\fP
Override default environment variable. May be given more than once. If the
optional \fBVALUE\fP is not supplied the variable will be defined to an empty
string.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-all\-unused\fP
Normally unused packages from a shared location are only deleted if the
quota is exceeded. Use this option to delete all unused packages to free
even more disk space.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP
Don\(aqt delete, just print what would be deleted.
.TP
.B \fB\-f, \-\-force\fP
Remove source workspaces that have unsaved changes in their SCM(s).
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Using this option \fIwill\fP result in data loss if there are unsaved
changes in checkout workspace directories. Use with great care.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-s, \-\-src\fP
Clean source workspaces too. By default only build and package workspaces
are considered.
.sp
\fBATTENTION:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
You should double check with \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP that no unintended workspaces
are actually deleted. While Bob can check SCMs that it knows it cannot
detect all modifications, e.g. changes to extracted tar files.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-used\fP
If a package is still used by a project on the machine it is not deleted by
default even if the quota is still exceeded. By giving this option such
packages are considered too. Note that this will most likely lead to
rebuilds/downloads of packages in the affected projects.
.TP
.B \fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP
Print what is done.
