.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Update layers or show their status. The following sub\-commands are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBls\fP
List known layers and their properties. There are multiple output formats
available. The output of this command is supposed to stay stable and is
thus suitable for scripting.
.TP
.B \fBupdate\fP
Updates the layers.
.TP
.B \fBstatus\fP
Show the SCM\-status of each layer and optionally list modifications. See
\fI\%bob status\fP for a description of the output
fields.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-attic\fP
Move layer workspace to attic if inline SCM switching is not possible.
(Default)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-attic\fP
Do not move layer workspace to attic if inline SCM switching is not possible.
Instead a build error is issued.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-format {yaml,json,flat}\fP
Selects a different output format. Defaults to \fByaml\fP\&. The \fBflat\fP format
is an INI\-style format where each key/value pair is printed on a separate
line.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-indent INDENT\fP
The \fByaml\fP and \fBjson\fP output formats are pretty printed with an
indentation of 4 spaces by default. Use this option to chance this to
\fBINDENT\fP number of spaces.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-indent\fP
Disables the pretty printing of the \fByaml\fP and \fBjson\fP formats. The
output will be more compact but is less readable.
.TP
.B \fB\-lc LAYERCONFIG\fP
Use additional layer configuration file.
.sp
This configuration file is used to control the layers checkout. It support
only a subset of the \fI\%Project configuration (config.yaml)\fP file keys, namely
\fBlayersInclude\fP, \fBlayersRequire\fP, \fBlayersScmOverrides\fP and
\fBlayersWhitelist\fP
.sp
The \fB\&.yaml\fP suffix is appended automatically and the configuration file
is searched relative to the build directory, unless an absolute path is
given. This option can be given multiple times. The files will be parsed in
the order as they appeared on the command line. Later files on the command
line have a higher precedence.
.TP
.B \fB\-D VAR=VALUE\fP
Override default or set environment variable.
.sp
Sets the variable \fBVAR\fP to \fBVALUE\fP\&. This overrides the value possibly
set by \fBdefault.yaml\fP, config files passed by \fB\-c\fP or any file that was
included by either of these files.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-show\-clean\fP
Show the status of a layer even if unmodified. This includes
\fB\-\-show\-overrides\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-show\-overrides\fP
Show layers that have active \fI\%layersScmOverrides\fP
(\fBO\fP) even if the layer is unchanged. Override information is always
displayed if a layer is shown but a \fBSTATUS\fP line is normally only
emitted if the SCM was modified. Adding \fB\-v\fP will additionally show the
detailed override status.
.TP
.B \fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP
Increase verbosity (may be specified multiple times)
