        Currently, Valid8r doesn't have a way to parse currency strings like "$1,234.56".
        This would be useful for financial applications...

        - [ ] Handles common formats: $1,234.56, 1234.56, etc.
        - [ ] Unit tests with 100% coverage
        - [ ] Docstring with examples

        1. **Fork and clone** the repository (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
        2. **Look at** `valid8r/core/parsers.py` for examples of similar parsers
        3. **Start with tests** in `tests/unit/test_parsers.py` (TDD required!)
        4. **Implement** the parser following the Maybe monad pattern
        5. **Run** `uv run tox` to verify all tests pass
