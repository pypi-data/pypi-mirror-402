    # The first step is to setup a CubitPy object. This object is derived from the
    # cubit python interface and provides all functionality of the direct cubit
    # python interface and also adds some additional functionality to make the
    # creation of 4C input files easier.

        cubit = CubitPy()

    # Once the CubitPy object is initialized, we can create our first brick
    # object. To do so we use the cubit python interface function `brick`.
    # This function returns a python object referencing the brick.
    brick = cubit.brick(brick_size, brick_size, brick_size)

    # Alternatively the brick could be created via the command line interface (CLI)
    # (not all cubit commands are available through python functions).
    # The `cubit.cmd` method allows to pass any cubit command as string.
    #
    # cubit.cmd(f"brick x {brick_size}")

    # The cube can be shown on your display using the following command
    # (You may have to click on the coordinate icon or refresh the display
    # for the item to show)
    if display:
        cubit.display_in_cubit()

    # You can also show the cube with ID labels on the geometry. The cupy object is
    # a container holding all of cubits enums, such as the geometry type.
    if display:
        cubit.display_in_cubit(labels=[cupy.geometry.curve, cupy.geometry.surface])

    # Now you must create the cylinder which will be used to cut the hole
    # from the brick. This is accomplished with the CLI.
    # (Alternatively we could also use the cubit python command `cubit.cylinder`)
    cubit.cmd(f"create cylinder height {brick_size * 1.2} radius {hole_radius}")

    # in the CUBIT display window.

    # Now, the cylinder can be subtracted from the brick to form the hole in the block.
    # Note that the after the subtraction, the cylinder volume is removed and the brick
    # object now points to the result of the subtraction.
    # For the subtraction, we need the ids of the respective volumes. There are two ways
    # to obtain the IDs:
    #   - Open Cubit and manually write down the volume IDs (in this case 1 and 2)
    #         cubit.cmd("subtract 2 from 1")
    #     This has the drawback that if something in the numbering changes, i.e., due to a
    #     Cubit internal change or if more items are inserted before the current ones, that
    #     the code has to be changed.
    #   - The more sustainable way is to get the ID from the cubit objects directly, which can
    #     be done with the `id()` method:
    cubit.cmd(f"subtract volume {cylinder.id()} from volume {brick.id()}")

    # size for the volume. we begin by setting an overall volume size interval.

    # straight curve is to receive approximately 10 mesh elements.
    cubit.cmd(f"volume {brick.id()} size {size}")

    # We will use a sweep mesh, so we will first mesh one surface of the body. We want to
    # first mesh the top surface. This surface can be selected by looking for the only
    # surface with a normal vector in positive z-direction.

    # In order to better resolve the hole in the middle of the surface,
    # we set a smaller size for the curve bounding this hole. We can either get the
    # curve ID from the GUI, or select them in python.

    # check if the curve lies on the surface of the cylinder and on the surface we want.

    # The volume mesh can now be generated. Again, the first step is to specify
    # the type of meshing scheme to be used and the second step is to issue the
    # order to mesh. In certain cases, the scheme can be determined by CUBIT
    # automatically. For sweepable volumes, the automatic scheme detection
