A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for biomedical research that provides a standardized connection layer between artificial intelligence systems and biomedical resources. Documentation and usage guides are available at: https://biocontext.ai

## Overview

**BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP** is an MCP server implementation for common biomedical resources, enabling agentic large language models (LLMs) to retrieve verified information and perform domain-specific tasks. Unlike previous approaches that required custom integration for each resource, BioContextAI KB MCP provides a unified access layer through the Model Context Protocol that enables interoperability between AI systems and domain-specific data sources.

The Knowledgebase MCP is available both as:

- An open-source software package for local hosting (see [Installation](#installation)) - **Choose this option for Claude Desktop, IDEs or your own agentic systems**
- A remote server for setup-free integration at https://biocontext-kb.fastmcp.app/mcp (for testing purposes only, subject to fair use)

> [!WARNING]
> If possible, we encourage you to run BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP locally to avoid rate limits and ensure the service's availability for applications that rely on remote hosting.

The Knowledgebase MCP is part of the wider [BioContextAI project](https://biocontext.ai). The **BioContextAI Registry** catalogues community servers that expose biomedical databases and analysis tools, providing the community with a resource for tool discovery and distribution. The registry index can be found at: https://biocontext.ai/registry.

## Implemented Tools

BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP exposes a number of external biomedical APIs. You can think of BioContextAI as a browser for your LLM that allows it to find relevant information across these knowledge bases. Please make sure to adhere to the usage limits (e.g., rate limits) of the respective services when using BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP.
If you use data from these services in your research, please make sure to cite both BioContextAI as well as the respective data source/tool.

> [!WARNING]
> The data accessed through these APIs is not covered by the BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP license. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the data aligns with permitted practices.

### OpenAPI MCP Servers

`FastMCP` allows for easy conversion of REST endpoints following the OpenAPI specification into MCP servers. We have added code to automatically create such servers based on schemas provided through a configuration file, so that users deploying their own version of BioContextAI can easily extend the list of available tools. The configuration file is located at `src/biocontext_kb/openapi/config.yaml`. By default, no OpenAPI servers are included, but you can edit the configuration file to add services.

## Installation

1. **Local setup with Claude Desktop**:

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file. To find it, click on your name and then “Settings”. Next, click on “Developer” to see “Local MCP servers” and then click on “Edit Config”.

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocontext_kb": {
      "command": "uvx", // On Mac, use "brew install uv"
      "args": [
        "biocontext_kb@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "UV_PYTHON": "3.12"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to restart Claude to apply the changes.

2. **Local setup with `uv`**

Run the server with streamable HTTP and uvicorn:

```bash
export MCP_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION && export PORT=8000 && uvx biocontext_kb
```

Run the server with stdio transport:

```bash
export MCP_ENVIRONMENT=DEVELOPMENT && uvx biocontext_kb
```

3. **Local setup with IDEs**

Change the configuration file of your coding agents, e.g., VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`), Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`), or WindSurf (`.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`):

```jsonc
{
  // VS Code: Use "servers" instead of "mcpServers"
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocontext_kb": {
      // if it doesn't work, replace with the `which uvx` path (installation via Homebrew recommended on macOS)
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "biocontext_kb@latest"
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

When using Windows and WSL2 the above config needs to be adapted as follows:

```jsonc
{
  // VS Code: "servers"
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocontext_kb": {
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "~/.local/bin/uvx", // set to the path to your `uvx`
        "biocontext_kb"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Docker**

Clone the latest version of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biocontext-ai/knowlegebase-mcp.git
cd knowlegebase-mcp
```

Then build the container, running gunicorn with multiple uvicorn workers:

```bash
# Build the docker container
docker build -t biocontext_kb:latest .
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 biocontext_kb:latest
```

This exposes your MCP server at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/

> [!WARNING]
> For public deployments, you should disable unnecessary ports and access your MCP server through a reverse proxy, e.g., Nginx or Caddy. You may also want to configure the running user and the directory to have limited rights, use Docker or podman in a rootless setup and take additional security measures like DDOS protection with Cloudflare or fail2ban.

### MCP Clients

To develop your own agentic systems that make use of the MCP server, you may want to consider some of the following options:

- [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/mcp/client/)
- [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome)
- [Langchain MCP adapters](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters)
- [mcp-use](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use)
