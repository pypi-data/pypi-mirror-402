    Knowledge management tools:

    - data_analysis: Answer statistical or analytical questions like "Show my
      quarterly revenue growth"
    - semantic_search: Search knowledge through natural language queries.
    - agent_memory: Agents can remember experiences, conversations and user
      preferences.
    - schema_info: Helps the Agent understand column names and dataset purpose.
      Avoid disabling
    - table_info: Allow the AI Agent to get information about datasets and schemas
    - create_dataset: Agents respond with data tables

    Actions:

    - calendar: Allow the Agent to access and make changes to your Google Calendar
    - schedule_recurring_message_tool: Eliminate busywork such as: "Send a summary
      of today's meetings at 5pm on workdays"

    Data processing tools:

    - data_classification: Agents handle queries like "Label these emails as high,
      medium, or low priority"
    - data_extraction: Helps the agent understand data from other tools. Avoid
      disabling
    - image_detection: Extract information from images using AI
    - pdf_extraction: Extraction of information from PDFs using AI

    Enhanced response tools:

    - connect_data: Agents provide buttons to import data in response to queries
      like "Connect Hubspot"
    - download_data: Agents handle queries like "download the table as CSV"

    Web tools:

    - web_search: Agents search the internet, and provide links to their sources
    - fetch_url: Fetch URL content
    - company_prospect_researcher: Agents provide information about companies
    - people_prospect_researcher: Agents provide information about people
