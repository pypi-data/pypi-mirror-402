        Parameters
        ----------
        parsed : `~urllib.parse.ParseResult`
            The result from parsing a URI using `urllib.parse`.
        root : `ResourcePath`, optional
            Path to use as root when converting relative to absolute.
            If `None`, it will be the current working directory. It is only
            used if a file-scheme is used incorrectly with a relative path.
        forceAbsolute : `bool`, ignored
            Has no effect for this subclass. ``file`` URIs are always
            absolute.
        forceDirectory : `bool`, optional
            If `True` forces the URI to end with a separator, otherwise given
            URI is interpreted as is.

        Returns
        -------
        modified : `~urllib.parse.ParseResult`
            Update result if a URI is being handled.
        dirLike : `bool` or `None`
            `True` if given parsed URI has a trailing separator or
            ``forceDirectory`` is `True`. Otherwise can return the given
            value of ``forceDirectory``.

        Notes
        -----
        Relative paths are explicitly not supported by RFC8089 but `urllib`
        does accept URIs of the form ``file:relative/path.ext``. They need
        to be turned into absolute paths before they can be used.  This is
        always done regardless of the ``forceAbsolute`` parameter.
