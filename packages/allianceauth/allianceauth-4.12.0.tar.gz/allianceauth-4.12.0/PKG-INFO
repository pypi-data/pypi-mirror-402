## Overview

Alliance Auth (AA) is a platform that helps Eve Online organizations efficiently manage access to applications and services.

Main features:

- Automatically grants or revokes user access to external services (e.g.: Discord, Mumble) based on the user's current membership to [a variety of EVE Online affiliation](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/core/states/) and [groups](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/core/groups/)

- Provides a central web site where users can directly access web apps (e.g. SRP requests, Fleet Schedule) and manage their access to external services and groups.

- Includes a set of connectors (called ["Services"](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/services/)) for integrating access management with many popular external applications / services like Discord, Mumble, Teamspeak 3, SMF and others

- Includes a set of web [Apps](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/apps/) which add many useful functions, e.g.: fleet schedule, timer board, SRP request management, fleet activity tracker

- Can be easily extended with additional services and apps. Many are provided by the community and can be found here: [Community Creations](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/community-creations)
