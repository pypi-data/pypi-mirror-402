# Contributing to langchain-glean

This document provides guidelines and instructions for setting up your development environment and contributing to `langchain-glean`.

## Development Environment

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tool management, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management, and [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) for task running.

### Prerequisites

1. Install mise:

    ```bash
    curl https://mise.run | sh
    ```

    Or via package manager (see [mise installation docs](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)).

### Setup Development Environment

1. Install tools and set up the development environment:

    ```bash
    mise install
