    """
    Decorator to register a client class under a given service name.

    If the service name is not explicitly provided, the decorator attempts to infer the service name
    based on the directory name of the module where the decorated class is defined. This is useful
    for automating the registration of service clients based on their directory structure.

    Args:
        service_name (Optional[str]): The name of the service to register the client under. If None,
                                      the name is inferred from the module's directory name.

    Returns:
        Callable: A decorator that registers the decorated class in the global `client_registry`
                  under the determined service name.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the service name could not be determined automatically.

        @register_client()
