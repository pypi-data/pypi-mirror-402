Diffhalos: Differentiable Populations of Dark Matter Halos
==========================================================

Diffhalos is a generative model of cosmological volumes of dark matter halos, subhalos,
and their merger trees, and these docs show you how to use it.
The Diffhalos library is written in `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`__,
and makes differentiable predictions for halo populations in a lightcone, or at a single redshift.
The code is publicly available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/ArgonneCPAC/diffhalos/>`__.
