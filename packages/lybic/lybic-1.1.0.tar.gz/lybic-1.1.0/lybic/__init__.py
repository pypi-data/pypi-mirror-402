# Strategy for handling extra fields in the lybic api response
# "ignore" means ignore extra fields, which will ensure that your SDK version remains compatible with the Lybic platform,
# but it may cause compatibility issues with future versions of the SDK.
# "forbid" means that the SDK will throw an error if it encounters extra fields in the response, which will force you to
# update your SDK when the Lybic platform is updated, and may have a certain impact on your online environment.
