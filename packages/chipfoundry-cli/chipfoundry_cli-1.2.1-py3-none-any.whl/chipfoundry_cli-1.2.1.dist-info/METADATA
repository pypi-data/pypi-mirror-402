# ChipFoundry CLI (`cf-cli`)

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/chipfoundry-cli?color=blue)](https://badge.fury.io/py/chipfoundry-cli)
[![PyPI downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/chipfoundry-cli.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/chipfoundry-cli/)

A command-line tool to automate the submission of ChipFoundry projects to the SFTP server and manage project results.

---

## Overview

`cf-cli` is a user-friendly command-line tool for securely submitting your ChipFoundry project files to the official SFTP server and downloading project results. It automatically collects the required files, generates or updates your project configuration, uploads everything to the correct location on the server, and provides tools to view project results and reports.

---

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install chipfoundry-cli
cf --help
```

---

## Quick Start

### For New Projects (Starting from Template)

1. **Clone the template** (or create new directory):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chipfoundry/caravel_user_project my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

2. **Set up the project** (replaces `make setup`):
   ```bash
   cf setup
   ```

3. **Generate SSH Key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   cf keygen
   ```

4. **Register your key** at [https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration](https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration)

5. **Configure your credentials**:
   ```bash
   cf config
   ```

6. **Upload your project**:
   ```bash
   cf push
   ```

7. **Download results** (when available):
   ```bash
   cf pull
   ```

8. **View tapeout report**:
   ```bash
   cf view-tapeout-report
   ```

9. **Confirm final tapeout** (when ready to send GDS to foundry):
   ```bash
   cf confirm
   ```

### For Existing Projects

If you already have a project with a Makefile:

1. **Generate SSH Key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   cf keygen
   ```

2. **Register your key** at [https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration](https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration)

3. **Configure your credentials**:
   ```bash
   cf config
   ```

4. **Initialize your project**:
   ```bash
   cf init
   ```

5. **Upload your project**:
   ```bash
   cf push
   ```

6. **Download results** (when available):
   ```bash
   cf pull
   ```

7. **View tapeout report**:
   ```bash
   cf view-tapeout-report
   ```

8. **Confirm final tapeout** (when ready to send GDS to foundry):
   ```bash
   cf confirm
   ```

---

## Project Structure Requirements

Your project directory **must** contain:

- `gds/` directory with **one** of the following:
  - `user_project_wrapper.gds` (for digital projects)
  - `user_analog_project_wrapper.gds` (for analog projects)
  - `openframe_project_wrapper.gds` (for openframe projects)
  - **Note**: Both compressed (`.gz`) and uncompressed (`.gds`) files are supported
- `verilog/rtl/user_defines.v` (required for digital/analog)
- `.cf/project.json` (optional; will be created/updated automatically)
  - Contains project metadata including `submission_state` ("Draft" or "Final")

**Example:**
```
my_project/
├── gds/
│   └── user_project_wrapper.gds
├── verilog/
│   └── rtl/
│       └── user_defines.v
└── .cf/
    └── project.json
```

---

## Authentication

The CLI uses SSH key authentication for secure SFTP access:

- **Default key location**: `~/.ssh/chipfoundry-key` (generated by `cf keygen`)
- **Alternative key**: Specify with `--sftp-key` option
- **SFTP username**: Required and configured via `cf config`

---

## SFTP Server

- **Default server**: `sftp.chipfoundry.io`
- **Username format**: `firstname-lastname` (e.g., `john-doe`)

---

## Commands

### Generate SSH Key

```bash
cf keygen [--overwrite]
```

- Generates a new RSA SSH key at `~/.ssh/chipfoundry-key`
- Displays the public key for registration
- Use `--overwrite` to regenerate an existing key
- **Next step**: Submit the public key to [https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration](https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration)

### View SSH Key

```bash
cf keyview
```

- Displays the current ChipFoundry SSH public key
- Useful for viewing your key without generating a new one
- Shows the same registration instructions as `cf keygen`

### Configure User Credentials

```bash
cf config
```

- Prompts for your SFTP username and key path
- Defaults to `~/.ssh/chipfoundry-key`
- Only needs to be run once per user/machine

### Initialize a New Project

```bash
cf init [--project-root DIRECTORY]
```

- **Smart defaults**: Auto-detects project name from directory and project type from GDS files
- **Interactive prompts**: Shows detected values in prompts for easy acceptance
- Creates `.cf/project.json` with project metadata
- **Note**: GDS hash is generated during `push`, not `init`

### Setup a ChipFoundry Project

```bash
cf setup [OPTIONS]
```

**Replaces `make setup`** - Comprehensive project setup with all dependencies.

**What it does:**
1. Initializes project configuration (`.cf/project.json`)
2. Syncs with upstream repository
3. Installs Caravel/Caravel-Lite
4. Sets up timing scripts
5. Configures Cocotb testing environment
6. Installs precheck tools
7. Pulls Docker images for verification
8. Runs IPM for dependency management

**Key Options:**
- `--only-init`: Just create configuration, skip installations
- `--dry-run`: Preview actions without making changes
- `--pdk TEXT`: Specify PDK variant (default: sky130A)
- `--caravel-lite` / `--no-caravel-lite`: Choose Caravel variant
- `--skip-caravel`, `--skip-openlane`, `--skip-pdk`, etc.: Skip specific installations
- `--repo-owner`, `--repo-name`, `--branch`: Custom repository source

**Examples:**
```bash
# Full setup (replaces make setup)
cf setup

# Quick configuration only
cf setup --only-init

# Preview what will be installed
cf setup --dry-run

# Custom PDK
cf setup --pdk sky130B

# Skip time-consuming installations
cf setup --skip-openlane --skip-pdk
```

**See also:**
- Detailed documentation: [docs/cf-setup.md](docs/cf-setup.md)
- Migration guide: [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md)

### Push a Project (Upload)

```bash
cf push [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--project-root`: Specify project directory
- `--force-overwrite`: Overwrite existing files on SFTP
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be uploaded
- `--sftp-username`: Override configured username
- `--sftp-key`: Override configured key path

**What happens:**
1. Collects required project files
2. Auto-detects project type from GDS file
3. Updates project configuration and GDS hash
4. Uploads files to SFTP with progress bars
5. Shows clean, informative output

**GDS File Handling:**
- **Both compressed (`.gz`) and uncompressed (`.gds`) files are supported**
- **No automatic compression** - files are uploaded as-is
- **Only one version allowed** - you cannot have both compressed and uncompressed versions of the same file
- **Prefers uncompressed files** when available
- **Falls back to compressed files** if no uncompressed version is available

### Pull Results (Download)

```bash
cf pull [--project-name NAME]
```

- Downloads project results from SFTP server
- Saves to `sftp-output/<project_name>/`
- **Automatically updates** your local `.cf/project.json` with the pulled version
- Creates the expected directory structure:
  ```
  sftp-output/
  └── <project_name>/
      ├── config/
      │   └── project.json
      └── consolidated_reports/
          └── consolidated_report.html
  ```

### Confirm Final Tapeout

```bash
cf confirm [OPTIONS]
```

- **Confirms your final tapeout** by setting `submission_state` to "Final"
- **Uploads only the project.json** to the SFTP server (not the entire project)
- **Use this when you're ready to send your current GDS file to the foundry** for tapeout processing
- **Options:**
  - `--project-root`: Specify project directory
  - `--project-name`: Override project name
  - `--sftp-username`: Override configured username
  - `--sftp-key`: Override configured key path

**Important:** This command confirms that your current GDS file is ready to be sent to the foundry for tapeout. Only run this when you are completely satisfied with your design and ready for final tapeout processing. This action cannot be easily undone.

### View Tapeout Report

```bash
cf view-tapeout-report [--project-name NAME] [--report-path PATH]
```

- Opens the consolidated tapeout report in your default browser
- **Auto-detects project name** from `.cf/project.json` if available
- Looks for report at `sftp-output/<project_name>/consolidated_reports/consolidated_report.html`
- **Options:**
  - `--project-name`: Specify project name manually
  - `--report-path`: Provide direct path to HTML report file

### Check Status

```bash
cf status
```

- Lists all your projects on the SFTP server
- Shows which projects have input files and/or results
- Displays project status in a clean table format

### Repository Management

#### Update Repository Files

```bash
cf repo update [OPTIONS]
```

- **Updates local project files** from the upstream GitHub repository
- **Fetches configuration** from `.cf/repo.json` in the specified repository and branch
- **Downloads and overwrites** local files based on the changes list in the configuration
- **Saves configuration** locally to `.cf/repo.json` for reference

**Options:**
- `--project-root`: Specify project directory (defaults to current directory)
- `--repo-owner`: GitHub repository owner (default: chipfoundry)
- `--repo-name`: GitHub repository name (default: caravel_user_project)
- `--branch`: Branch name containing the repo.json file (default: main)
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without updating files

**What happens:**
1. Fetches `.cf/repo.json` from the specified GitHub repository and branch
2. Downloads and saves the configuration file locally to `.cf/repo.json`
3. Downloads and overwrites each file listed in the `changes` array
4. Provides detailed feedback on success/failure of each file update

**Example:**
```bash
# Preview what would be updated
cf repo update --dry-run
# Output:
# Files that would be updated:
#   • .cf/repo.json (configuration file)
#   • README.md
#   • Makefile
#   • openlane/Makefile

# Update files from upstream
cf repo update
# Output:
# Update results:
# ✓ Updated: .cf/repo.json
# ✓ Updated: README.md
# ✓ Updated: Makefile
# ✓ Updated: openlane/Makefile
# Successfully updated 4 file(s)
# All files updated successfully!
```

**Use cases:**
- Keep your project up-to-date with upstream changes
- Apply bug fixes and improvements from the template repository
- Sync configuration changes from the upstream project
- Maintain consistency with the latest project structure

---

## Submission Workflow and States

The CLI tracks your project submission state through the `submission_state` field in `project.json`:

### Project States

- **"Draft"** - Initial state when you run `cf init`
  - Project is ready for development and testing
  - You can push updates multiple times
  - Project is not yet ready for tapeout processing

- **"Final"** - Confirmed state when you run `cf confirm`
  - GDS file is ready to be sent to the foundry for tapeout
  - No further changes should be made to the design
  - Only the project.json is uploaded (not the full project)

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Development Phase:**
   ```bash
   cf init          # Creates project with submission_state: "Draft"
   cf push          # Upload project files (state remains "Draft")
   # ... make changes to your project ...
   cf push          # Upload updated files (state remains "Draft")
   ```

2. **Review Phase (Optional):**
   ```bash
   cf pull          # Download results for review (if available)
   cf view-tapeout-report  # Review the tapeout report (if available)
   ```

3. **Final Tapeout Confirmation:**
   ```bash
   cf confirm       # Confirm current GDS file is ready for foundry tapeout
   ```

**Important:** Only run `cf confirm` when you are completely satisfied with your GDS file and ready to send it to the foundry for tapeout processing. This action cannot be easily undone.

---

## How the GDS Hash Works

- The `user_project_wrapper_hash` in `.cf/project.json` is **automatically generated and updated during `push`**
- The hash is calculated from the actual GDS file being uploaded
- This ensures the hash always matches the file you are submitting
- **You do not need to manage or update the hash manually**
- The hash is NOT generated during `init` because the GDS file may not exist or may change before submission

---

## What Happens When You Run `cf push`?

1. **File Collection:**
   - Checks for required GDS and Verilog files
   - Auto-detects project type (digital, analog, openframe) based on GDS file name
   - **Supports both compressed and uncompressed GDS files**

2. **Configuration:**
   - Creates or updates `.cf/project.json`
   - Updates the GDS hash and any CLI-overridden fields

3. **SFTP Upload:**
   - Connects to the SFTP server securely
   - Creates project directory structure
   - Uploads files with progress indicators
   - Shows clean, minimal output

4. **Success:**
   - Displays confirmation with project location

---

## What Happens When You Run `cf pull`?

1. **Connection:**
   - Connects to SFTP server securely
   - Shows clean connection status

2. **Download:**
   - Downloads all project results recursively
   - Shows professional download progress
   - Saves to `sftp-output/<project_name>/`

3. **Config Update:**
   - **Automatically updates** your local `.cf/project.json` with the pulled version
   - No manual steps required

4. **Success:**
   - Shows confirmation of downloaded files and updated config

## Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Generate SSH key and register it
cf keygen
# Copy the displayed key to https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration

# Configure your account
cf config
# Enter: john-doe
# Enter: (press Enter for default key)

# Initialize project (in your project directory)
cf init
# Project name (detected: my_awesome_project): 
# Project type (digital/analog/openframe) (detected: digital): 

# Upload your project
cf push
# Connecting to sftp.chipfoundry.io...
# Uploading project.json ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
# Uploading user_project_wrapper.gds ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
# ✓ Uploaded to incoming/projects/my_awesome_project

# Later, download results
cf pull
# ✓ Connected to sftp.chipfoundry.io
# Downloading project results from outgoing/results/my_awesome_project...
# ✓ All files downloaded to sftp-output/my_awesome_project
# ✓ Project config automatically updated

# Review the tapeout report (if available)
cf view-tapeout-report
# ✓ Opened tapeout report in browser: sftp-output/my_awesome_project/consolidated_reports/consolidated_report.html

# When ready, confirm final tapeout (sends GDS to foundry)
cf confirm
# ✓ Updated project.json with submission_state = Final
# ✓ Confirmed project submission: my_awesome_project
# ✓ Uploaded project.json to incoming/projects/my_awesome_project/.cf/project.json
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Preview what would be uploaded
cf push --dry-run

# Force overwrite existing files
cf push --force-overwrite

# Use different project root
cf push --project-root /path/to/project

# Pull results for specific project
cf pull --project-name other_project

# View report for specific project
cf view-tapeout-report --project-name other_project

# Confirm final tapeout for specific project
cf confirm --project-name other_project

# View custom report file
cf view-tapeout-report --report-path /path/to/custom_report.html

# Check project status
cf status
```

### GDS File Examples

```bash
# Uncompressed GDS file (preferred)
gds/user_project_wrapper.gds

# Compressed GDS file (also supported)
gds/user_project_wrapper.gds.gz

# ❌ INVALID: Both files exist - this will cause an error
gds/user_project_wrapper.gds      # ← Choose ONE version only
gds/user_project_wrapper.gds.gz   # ← Remove this one
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing files:**
  - The tool will error out if required files are missing or if more than one GDS type is present

- **Authentication errors:**
  - Run `cf keygen` to generate a new key
  - Ensure your key is registered at [https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration](https://chipfoundry.io/sftp-registration)
  - Check your username with `cf config`

- **SFTP errors:**
  - Check your network connection
  - Verify your credentials with `cf config`

- **Project type detection:**
  - Only one of the recognized GDS files should be present in your `gds/` directory
  - Both compressed and uncompressed versions of the same type are supported
  - **Important**: You cannot have both compressed (`.gz`) and uncompressed (`.gds`) versions of the same file - the tool will error out and ask you to remove one

- **Report viewing errors:**
  - Ensure you've run `cf pull` first to download the report
  - Check that the report exists at the expected location
  - Use `--report-path` to specify a custom report location

- **Repository update errors:**
  - Check your internet connection
  - Verify the repository and branch exist
  - Use `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying them
  - Check that the `.cf/repo.json` file exists in the upstream repository

- **ModuleNotFoundError:**
  - Upgrade the CLI: `pip install --upgrade chipfoundry-cli`
