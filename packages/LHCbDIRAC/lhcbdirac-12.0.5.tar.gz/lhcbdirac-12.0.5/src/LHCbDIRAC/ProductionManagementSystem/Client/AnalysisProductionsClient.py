"""Client for accessing data about Analysis Productions

Overview of concepts
--------------------

The basic objects stored for Analysis Productions are::

                  ┌─────────────┐
                  │ Publication │
                  └──────┬──────┘
                         *
                         │
                         1
  ┌─────────┐        ┌───┴────┐        ┌──────┐
  │ Request ├1──────*┤ Sample ├1──────*┤ User │
  └────┬────┘        └───┬────┘        └──────┘
       1                 1
       │                 │
       *                 *
  ┌────┴────┐         ┌──┴──┐
  │ AutoTag │         │ Tag │
  └─────────┘         └─────┘

* **Request**:
    A *Request* in the :py:mod:`.AnalysisProductionsDB` corresponds request in
    the :py:mod:`.ProductionRequestDB` with the type ``AnalysisProduction``.
    Each processed *Request* corresponds to 2 or more *Transformations* from
    the :py:mod:`.TransformationSystem` and the output LFNs are found by
    querying the Bookkeeping.
* **Sample**:
    A *Sample* wraps around a *Request* to allow a single sample to be reused.
    It can be uniquely identified by a ``WG``, ``analysis``, ``name`` and
    ``version`` where ``name`` comes from the original ``info.yaml`` file that
    was used to submit the production and ``version`` is the version of the tag
    in the ``AnalysisProductions`` data-package.
* **Tag**:
    A *Tag* is a `key` and `value` that can be used to query for a specific
    *Sample*. These can be manually defined by a _User_ to apply analysis specific
    metadata to a sample.
* **AutoTag**:
    Similar to a *Tag* how ever these are automatically computed from the
    *Bookkeeping* and applies to the underlying *Request* object. The keys of
    *AutoTags* are reserved and cannot be used by *Tags*.
* **User**:
    The nickname of the person who is able to modify and *Archive* a specific *Sample*.
* **Publication**:
    Denote that this was used for an LHCb result and the data for the underlying
    *Request* should be permanently preserved.

Archiving samples
-----------------

Arching a *Sample* is a way of denoting that is no longer useful. Typically
because it has been superseded be another *Sample*. When all child *Samples*
of a *Request* have been archived it is an indication that the data of the
*Request* can be permanently deleted.

Time travel
-----------

Most methods have an optional ``at_time`` argument which can be used to query
the database at a specific point in the past. This allows for the database to
continue to be chaged over time and while still allowing for high quality
analysis preservation.

Populating the database
-----------------------

The database is populated automatically by the :py:mod:`.APSyncAgent`.

Legacy considerations
---------------------

Prior to the creation of the ``AnalysisProductions`` data-package, the
``WG/CharmConfig`` and ``WG/CharmWGProd`` were used to automatically submit
production requests. Samples from this system were manually imported and are
mostly the same as those submitted by ``AnalysisProductions`` except the
``version`` of the production is of the form ``vXrYpZ (PackageName)``.
