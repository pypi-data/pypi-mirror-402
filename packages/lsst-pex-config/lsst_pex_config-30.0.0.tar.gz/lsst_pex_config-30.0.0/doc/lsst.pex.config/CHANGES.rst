lsst-pex-config v30.0.0 (2026-01-15)
====================================

Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported version.
Tested on Python 3.14.

New Features
------------

- Added a ``copy`` method that unfreezes. (`DM-16523 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-16523>`_)
- * Changed the config loader method such that if a relative path is specified inside another config it is treated as being relative to that original config file.
  * Modified the config loader to support URI schemes ``file``, ``resource``, and ``eups`` supported by ``lsst-resources``.
    This change means that in some cases ``__file__`` can be a URI string and not a simple path. (`DM-33226 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-33226>`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug that caused history-printing to fail when the initial value for a field was `None`. (`DM-51850 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-51850>`_)
- Fixed copying of ``ConfigDictField``. (`DM-53767 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-53767>`_)
- Fixed copying of ``ConfigChoiceField`` and ``RegistryField``. (`DM-53791 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-53791>`_)


lsst-pex-config v29.0.0 (2025-03-25)
====================================

New Features
------------

- Introduced the ``keyCheck`` callback to ``DictField`` and ``ConfigDictField``, allowing custom key validation during assignment. Added unit tests to ensure functionality. (`DM-48074 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-48074>`_)
- Make the messages emitted by ``compareConfigs`` consistently start with the fully-qualified name of the config field. (`DM-49121 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-49121>`_)

====================================

New Features
------------

- Added a dynamic-default callback argument to ``RegistryField``. (`DM-31924 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-31924>`_)
- Introduced ``ConfigurableActions``. These are ``pex_config`` fields and config types which function as a functor, state is set at config time, but the ``ConfigurableActions`` are callable at runtime to produce an action. (`DM-36649 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-36649>`_)


API Changes
-----------

- The ``loadFromStream`` and ``loadFromString`` methods now take a dictionary as an optional argument which allows specifying additional variables to use in local scope when reading configs. (`DM-40198 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-40198>`_)
