canns-lib: High-performance computational acceleration library for CANNS

This library provides optimized Rust implementations for various computational tasks
needed by the CANNS (Continuous Attractor Neural Networks) package, including:

- ripser: Topological data analysis with persistent homology (Ripser algorithm)
- [Future modules]: Fast approximate nearest neighbors, dynamics computation, etc.

All modules are designed for high performance while maintaining easy-to-use Python APIs.

# Import the Rust extension module - this makes _ripser_core and _spatial_core available

# Import Python wrapper modules
