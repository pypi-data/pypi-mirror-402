1.  **Set up the environment:**
    ```bash
    make -C onecoder setup
    ```
2.  **Configure your API key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `onecoder` directory with your OpenRouter API key:
    ```
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
3.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    make -C onecoder run
    ```
