## What even is this?
A Little tool written in python to watch and download anime from the terminal (the better way to watch anime)
This project's main aim is to create a enjoyable anime watching and downloading experience, directly in the terminal - your favorite place.

Since the version 3 rewrite this project is split into api and frontend this makes it easy to integrate this into your project!

## You are just here for the client?

As one wise man once said:
> I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE FUCKING CODE! i just want to download this stupid fucking application and use it.
>
> WHY IS THERE CODE??? MAKE A FUCKING .EXE FILE AND GIVE IT TO ME. these dumbfucks think that everyone is a developer and understands code. well i am not and i don't understand it. I only know to download and install applications. SO WHY THE FUCK IS THERE CODE? make an EXE file and give it to me. STUPID FUCKING SMELLY NERDS

<sub>Please do not take this seriously this is some stupid copypasta</sub>

We do not have a .exe but we have pipx: `pipx install anipy-cli`
