    "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself "
    "transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and "
    "if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and "
    "divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and "
    "seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with "
    "the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked."
