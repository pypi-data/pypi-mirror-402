    Represents a captured error during the search process.

    but are configured to continue execution.

    Attributes:
        error_type (str): The classification or name of the error (e.g., the exception class name).
        message (str): The string representation of the error message.
        debug_info (Any): Arbitrary context for debugging (e.g., stack trace, raw HTML).
