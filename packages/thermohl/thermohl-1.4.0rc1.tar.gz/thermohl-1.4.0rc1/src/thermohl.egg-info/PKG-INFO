Temperature estimation of overhead line conductors is an important topic for 
TSOs for technical, economic, and safety-related reasons (DLR/ampacity, sag 
management ...). It depends on several factors, mainly transit, weather and the
conductor properties. ThermOHL is a python package to compute temperature and/or 
ampacity in overhead line conductors.

## Features

The temperature of a conductor is estimated by solving a heat equation
which describes how temperature evolves over time, taking into account
different power terms that either heat or cold the conductor (see next picture 
from CIGRE[1]).

![image](thermohl-docs/docs/assets/images/cigre_balance.png "Overhead conductor heating and cooling. From [CIGRE].")

Two heat equations (a more complete, third one is under development)
are available:

* one with a single temperature for the cable;
* another with three temperatures (core, average and surface
  temperature) for more precise computations.

Each of these equations can be used with a set of pre-coded power
terms from the literature :

* one using CIGRE recommendations [1];  
* one using the IEEE standard [2];  
* two others from RTE departments.

Solvers derivated from heat equations can compute steady-state
temperature or ampacity, and transient temperature. The set of
[parameter](thermohl-docs/docs/api-reference/parameters.md) required depends on 
the power terms used, and default values are provided.

## Users

---

### Environment
ThermOHL is using pip for project and dependencies management.
You need a compatible version of python (3.8 or higher). You may have to install it manually (e.g. with pyenv). Then you may create a virtualenv and activate it.

### Set up thermohl

To install the package using uv, execute the following command:

```shell
    uv pip install "thermohl @ git+https://github.com/phlowers/thermohl"
```
Use it ! You can report to the user guide section.
```shell
    import thermohl
    print(thermohl.__version__)
```
Use it ! You can report to the user guide section.
```shell
    import thermohl
    print(thermohl.__version__)
```

## Developers

---

Install the development dependencies and program scripts via

```shell
  uv pip install -e .
  uv sync --group dev
```

Build a new wheel via

```shell
  uv build --wheel
```

This build a wheel in newly-created dist/ directory

## Building the documentation with mkdocs

First, make sure you have mkdocs and the Readthedocs theme installed.

If you use uv, open a terminal and enter the following commands:

```shell 
  uv sync --group docs
```

Then, in the same terminal, build the doc with:

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

The documentation can then be accessed locally from http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Simple usage

Solvers in thermOHL take a dictionary as an argument, where all keys are strings and all values are either integers,
floats or 1D `numpy.ndarray` of integers or floats. It is important to note that all arrays should have the same size.
Missing or `None` values in the input dictionary are replaced with a default value, available using
`solver.default_values()`, which are read from `thermohl/default_values.yaml`.

### Example 1

This example uses the single-temperature heat equation (`1t`) with IEEE power terms and default values to compute the
surface temperature (°C) of a conductor in steady-state regime along with the corresponding power terms (W.m<sup>-1</sup>).

```python
from thermohl import solver

slvr = solver.ieee(dic=None, heateq='1t')
temp = slvr.steady_temperature() 
```

Results from the solver are returned in a `pandas.DataFrame`:

``` python
>>> print(temp)
           t   P_joule  P_solar  P_convection  P_radiation  P_precipitation
0  27.236417  0.273056  9.64051      6.587129     3.326436              0.0
```

### Example 2

This example uses the same heat equation and power terms, but to compute the line ampacity (A), ie the maximum power 
intensity that can be used in a conductor without exceeding a specified maximal temperature (°C), along with the 
corresponding power terms (W.m<sup>-1</sup>). We can see that, for three different ambient temperature, we have three
distinct ampacities (and the lower the ambient temperature, the higher the ampacity).

```python
import numpy as np
from thermohl import solver

slvr = solver.ieee(dict(Ta=np.array([0., 15., 30.])), heateq='1t')
Tmax = 80.
imax = slvr.steady_intensity(Tmax)
```

```
>>> print(imax)
       transit    P_joule  P_solar  P_convection  P_radiation  P_precipitation
