TORAX-MUSCLE3 packaging
=======================

Updating and testing the TORAX-MUSCLE3 Easybuild configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following steps must be performed for each of the supported tool chains
(currently ``intel-2023b``, ``foss-2023b``):

1.  Create the ``.eb`` file for the new release.

    a.  Copy the ``.eb`` file from the previous release.
    b.  Update the ``version`` to reflect the just-released version tag.
    c.  If any of the TORAX-MUSCLE3 dependencies in ``pyproject.toml`` where updated or changed
        since the previous release, update the easybuild dependencies:

        -   ``builddependencies`` contains build-time dependencies which are available
            as a module on SDCC.
        -   ``dependencies`` contains run-time dependencies which are available as a
            module on SDCC.
        -   ``exts_list`` contains python package dependencies (and potentially
            dependencies of dependencies) which are not available in any of the Python
            modules on SDCC.

    d.  Update the checksum of imas: download an archive of the TORAX-MUSCLE3 repository from
        bitbucket. This is easiest to do by copying the following URL, replace
        ``<version>`` with the version tag, and paste it in a web browser:

        .. code-block:: text
            https://github.com/iterorganization/TORAX-MUSCLE3/archive/refs/tags/<version>.tar.gz
        Then, calculate the hash of the downloaded archive with ``sha256sum`` and update
        it in the ``.eb`` file.

2.  Push the resulting ``.eb`` file to the `easybuild-easyconfigs repository
    <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs>`_.

3.  Test the easybuild configuration:

    a.  Create an easybuild module, replace ``<eb_file>`` with the filename of the
        ``.eb`` file created in step 1.

        .. code-block:: bash
            module purge
            module load EasyBuild
            eb --rebuild <eb_file>
        If this is unsuccessful, investigate the error and update the ``.eb``
        configuration. A useful environment variable for debugging is ``export
        PIP_LOG=pip.log``, which instructs pip to write logs to the specified file
        (``pip.log`` in this example).
    b.  If the module was successfully installed by easybuild, load it:

        .. code-block:: bash
            module purge
            module use ~/.local/easybuild/modules/all/
            module load TORAX-MUSCLE3/<version>-<toolchain>
    
    c.  Sanity check the module, for example by running the ``pytest`` unit tests.
        These sanity checks should also be included (and run) as part of the EasyBuild installation process.
