# Dimension Calculation

**Dimension Calculation** is a Python package designed to estimate the *effective dimension* of a dataset using several statistical and geometrical approaches.
It is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, mixed variable types, or when studying the curse of dimensionality.

## ✨ Features

- Supports **multiple dimension estimation methods**.
- Works with **numerical and categorical data**.
- Automatic preprocessing:
  - Missing value handling,
  - Label encoding for categorical variables,
  - Feature normalisation.
- Designed for **data analysis and research purposes**.

## 📦 Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dimension-calculation
```

## 🚀 Quick start

```python
import pandas as pd
import dimension_calculation as dc

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

dimension = dc.dimension_calculation(df)

print(dimension)
```

By default, the method `"nearest-neighbour-3"` is used.

## 🧠 Available methods

The `dimension_calculation` function supports the following methods:

* `"variance-ratio"`
* `"n1"`
* `"n2"`
* `"infinite-n"`
* `"MCMC"`
* `"nearest-neighbour-1"`
* `"nearest-neighbour-2"`
* `"nearest-neighbour-3"` *(default)*

Example:

```python
dc.dimension_calculation(df, method="variance-ratio")
```

## 📊 Function signature

```python
dimension_calculation(
    dataframe: pd.DataFrame,
    method: str = "nearest-neighbour-3"
) -> int
```

### Parameters

* **dataframe** (`pd.DataFrame`)
  Input dataset. Must contain at least two columns.

* **method** (`str`)
  Dimension estimation method to use.

### Returns

* **int**
  Estimated effective dimensionality of the dataset.

## ⚠️ Notes and assumptions

* Missing values are automatically replaced with `0`.
* Categorical variables are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
* Features are scaled to `[0, 1]` using `MinMaxScaler`.
* Some methods rely on random sampling and may produce slightly different results across runs.
