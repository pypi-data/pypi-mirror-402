2. Configure your sso as below:

```bash
aws configure sso
  name = moveai
  start url = https://d-93676e215a.awsapps.com/start#
  region = eu-west-1

pip install poetry
```

Run the following with your profile name:

```bash
export AWS_PIP_PASSWORD=`aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --profile <profile_name> --domain moveai --domain-owner 103680339861 --region eu-west-1 --query authorizationToken --output text`
poetry config http-basic.move aws $AWS_PIP_PASSWORD
poetry install
```

## Pre-commit for contribution

After you perform `poetry install`, please perform the following command. This will allow the pre-commit checks to run each time you commit a new change to git.

```poetry run pre-commit install```

    # TODO: Add instructions in https://moveai.atlassian.net/browse/EGT-391

## Tests

From the repo root directory, run:

```bash
poetry run pytest

```


## Version control

This repository follows a trunk-based development in git i.e. all changes are merged to main directly and all branches are created from main. For more info please see [this documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development).

All PRs are merged to main directly and all branches are created from main. Only these branches are allowed to be merged to the main branch: feature/, hotfix/, bugfix/, dependabot/, cruft/

Note:
 - Direct pushes to main are not allowed (this is because of the enforced ruleset on github)
 - All changes to be merged to main via a pull request
 - A PR can't be merged until both `unittest` and `pre-commit` checks have been passed

Please refer to [this](https://www.notion.so/moveai/SPIKE-Infrastructure-36ec9c8c8d114a84bfa0611be6e6f150#752e1d53eb814e2c8820ae3eef48141a) notion doc on the git flow used in this repository.


## PyPi release

An encrypted version of this package will be released on pypi automatically as part of the release workflow (`release.yml`). If this package doesn't need to be on pypi, please remove this job manually from `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### Troubleshooting

- If the pypi release workflow gets stuck, please make sure that another workflow (in another `mocap-*`) is not running. If another workflow is currently running, then please wait for it to be finished and then try again.
- This is because the WIBU token can only be run on one instance at a time, each subsequent workflow should have a one hour difference between runs - this is a known limitation and would be fixed in a future version of the release workflow in `mocap-template`.

### Encryption setup files

We need the following files for the debianize release action to be able to create an accurate `.deb` release.

1. protect.WibuCpsConf: contains the Wibu configuration to encrpyt the package correctly.
2. CMakeLists.txt: contains a set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets.
3. resources/postinst_template: the post installation template for this project.
