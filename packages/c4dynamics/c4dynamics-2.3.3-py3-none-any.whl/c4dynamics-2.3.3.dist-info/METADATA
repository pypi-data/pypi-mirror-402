## Documentation

📘 **Full documentation:**  
https://c4dynamics.github.io/c4dynamics/

- Installation and setup guides  
- Core concepts and state-space modeling philosophy  
- API reference and examples  
- Tutorials for filtering, sensing, and simulation workflows




## Why c4dynamics?

✅ State objects for easy modeling

✅ Built-in functions for Kalman filters

✅ Integrated sensors and object detection models

✅ Out-of-the-box environments for reinforcement learning 

✅ Seamless integration with OpenCV & Open3D 

✅ Optimization for Monte Carlo simulations




**c4dynamics** is designed to 
simplify the development of algorithms for dynamic systems, 
using state space representations. 
It offers engineers and researchers a systematic approach to model, 
simulate, and control systems in fields like 
``robotics, aerospace,`` and ``navigation``.

The framework introduces ``state objects,`` which are foundational 
data structures that encapsulate state vectors and provide 
the tools for managing data, simulating system behavior, 
and analyzing results. 

With integrated modules for sensors, 
detectors, and filters, 
c4dynamics accelerates algorithm development 
while maintaining flexibility and scalability.



## Requirements 
- 3.8 <= Python < 3.13
- Required packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)



## Installation 

For detailed instructions on installing c4dynamics, including setup for virtual environments, Python version requirements, and troubleshooting, refer to the [c4dynamics setup guide](c4dynamics_setup.ipynb).

* [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/c4dynamics/)

```
>>> pip install c4dynamics
```



* [GitHub](https://github.com/C4dynamics/C4dynamics)  

To run the latest GitHub version, download the repo and install required packages:

```
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 
 
 

## Quickstart

Import c4dynamics:
```python
>>> import c4dynamics as c4d
```

Define state space object of two variables in the state space (y, vy) with initial conditions (change the state with your variables): 
```python
>>> s = c4d.state(y = 1, vy = 0.5)
``` 

Multiply the state vector by a matrix and store:  
```python
>>> F = [[1, 1],                      
         [0, 1]]              
>>> s.X += F @ s.X                     
>>> s.store(t = 1)                    
```

Print the state variables, the state vector, and the stored data:  
```python
>>> print(s)  
[ y  vy ]
>>> s.X 
[2.5  1]
>>> s.data('y') 
([0,  1], [1,  2.5])
```
