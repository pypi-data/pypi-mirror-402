AWS EC2 Security Group Discovery and Analysis Tool

CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: This script analyzes security group configurations across
multiple AWS accounts. Security groups are fundamental network access controls that
directly impact the security posture of AWS workloads.

Purpose:
    Discovers, analyzes, and inventories EC2 security groups across AWS Organizations
    with advanced filtering, reference tracking, and rule analysis capabilities.
    Essential for security auditing, compliance validation, and network governance.

AWS API Operations:
    - ec2.describe_security_groups(): Primary security group discovery
    - ec2.describe_instances(): Instance-to-security-group associations
    - ec2.describe_network_interfaces(): ENI-to-security-group mappings
    - ec2.describe_load_balancers(): ELB security group references
    - Additional service APIs for comprehensive reference tracking

Security Analysis Features:
    - Default security group identification (critical for compliance)
    - Unused security group detection (attack surface reduction)
    - Security rule analysis and breakdown
    - Cross-service reference tracking
    - Fragment-based filtering for targeted analysis

Compliance Use Cases:
    - PCI DSS network segmentation validation
    - SOC2 access control auditing
    - CIS benchmark security group compliance
    - Zero Trust network architecture assessment
    - Security group sprawl management

Performance Features:
    - Multi-threaded discovery across accounts/regions
    - Progress tracking for large environments
    - Memory-efficient processing of complex relationships
    - Configurable analysis depth (basic vs comprehensive)

Risk Mitigation:
    - Read-only operations with minimal permissions
    - Comprehensive audit logging
    - No modification capabilities (analysis only)
    - Safe handling of large security group inventories

Usage:
    python find_ec2_security_groups.py -p <profile> --default
    python find_ec2_security_groups.py -p <profile> --references --rules

    default security group detection, reference tracking, rule analysis,
    and filtering capabilities for comprehensive security posture assessment.

    Args:
        f_arguments (list): Command-line arguments to parse (typically sys.argv[1:])

    Returns:
        argparse.Namespace: Parsed arguments containing:
            - Profiles: AWS profiles for multi-account security analysis
            - Regions: Target AWS regions for security group discovery
            - Fragments: Security group name fragments for targeted analysis

            - pRules: Enable detailed security rule analysis
            - Other standard framework arguments

    Security-Specific Arguments:
        --default: Critical for compliance auditing. Default security groups
                  often violate security policies and should be closely monitored.

        --references: Enables comprehensive reference tracking across:
                     - EC2 instances and their ENIs
                     - Load balancers (ALB, NLB, CLB)

        --noempty: Filters unused security groups that represent potential
                  attack surface. Useful for security group hygiene and
                  attack surface reduction initiatives.

        --rules: Enables detailed ingress/egress rule analysis including:
                - Protocol and port mappings
                - Source/destination CIDR analysis
                - Cross-security-group references
                - Overly permissive rule identification

    Use Cases:
        - Compliance auditing: --default for policy violations
        - Security hygiene: --noempty for unused resource cleanup
        - Incident response: --references for blast radius analysis
        - Security architecture: --rules for network segmentation review

    Execute multi-threaded security group discovery and analysis across AWS accounts.

    This is the core orchestration function that performs concurrent security group
    analysis across all provided AWS accounts and regions. Implements comprehensive
    security group discovery with optional deep analysis capabilities.

    Args:
        fCredentialList (list): List of credential dictionaries containing:
            - AccountId: AWS account identifier
            - Region: AWS region name
            - AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, SessionToken: AWS credentials
            - Success: Boolean flag indicating credential validation status

        fFragment (list, optional): Security group name fragments for filtering.
            Enables targeted analysis of specific security groups by name pattern.

        fExact (bool, optional): Use exact matching for fragments instead of
            substring matching. Defaults to False (partial matching).

        fDefault (bool, optional): Focus analysis on default security groups only.
            Critical for compliance auditing as default SGs often violate policies.

        fReferences (bool, optional): Enable comprehensive reference tracking.
            Discovers all AWS resources associated with each security group.

        fRules (bool, optional): Enable detailed security rule analysis.
            Breaks down ingress/egress rules for granular security assessment.

    Returns:
        list: Comprehensive list of security group dictionaries with metadata:
            - GroupId: Security group identifier
            - GroupName: Security group name

            - Rules: Detailed rule analysis (if fRules=True)
            - References: Associated resources (if fReferences=True)

    Threading Architecture:
        - Uses Queue for thread-safe work distribution
        - Worker thread pool sized for optimal AWS API performance
        - Progress tracking via tqdm for user feedback
        - Comprehensive error handling for failed account access

    Security Analysis Modes:
        1. Basic Discovery: Security group enumeration and metadata
        2. Reference Tracking: Cross-service resource associations
        3. Rule Analysis: Granular ingress/egress rule breakdown
        4. Default Focus: Compliance-oriented default security group audit

    Performance Optimization:
        - Concurrent processing across accounts/regions
        - Efficient API pagination handling
        - Memory-conscious processing for large environments
        - Rate limiting respect for AWS API throttling

    Error Handling:
        - Account access failures: Logged and skipped gracefully
        - API throttling: Handled through retry logic
        - Permission errors: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
        - Invalid credentials: Validation and error reporting

    Security Considerations:
        - Read-only operations only (no modifications)
