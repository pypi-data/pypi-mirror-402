AWS Service Catalog Provisioned Products Discovery and Management Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery, analysis, and optional cleanup capabilities for
AWS Service Catalog provisioned products within single AWS accounts. It's designed for enterprise
cloud governance teams who need visibility into Service Catalog product lifecycle management,
CloudFormation stack reconciliation, and automated cleanup capabilities for failed or orphaned products.

Key Features:
- Service Catalog provisioned product discovery with comprehensive metadata extraction
- CloudFormation stack reconciliation and correlation analysis
- Automated detection of errored, tainted, or orphaned products
- Optional automated cleanup capabilities with safety controls
- Account status correlation and suspended account detection
- Fragment-based search for targeted product discovery and analysis
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Service Catalog governance and product lifecycle management
- CloudFormation stack reconciliation and orphaned resource detection
- Automated cleanup of failed or errored provisioned products
- Account provisioning audit and compliance reporting
- Cost optimization through orphaned resource identification
- Service Catalog product portfolio analysis and governance
- Multi-account provisioning oversight and standardization

Service Catalog Product Analysis Features:
- Comprehensive provisioned product enumeration with status tracking
- CloudFormation stack correlation and dependency analysis
- Account creation tracking through Service Catalog account vending
- Product version and artifact analysis for governance oversight
- Error detection and automated remediation recommendations
- Orphaned product identification for cleanup and cost optimization

Security Considerations:
- Uses single profile authentication for focused Service Catalog operations
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports optional deletion operations with explicit safety controls
- Respects Service Catalog permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive provisioning information handling with appropriate access controls

Governance and Compliance Features:
- Service Catalog product lifecycle tracking for organizational oversight
- CloudFormation stack correlation for governance and compliance
- Account provisioning tracking through Service Catalog automation
- Product portfolio analysis for standardization and governance
- Error detection and remediation for operational excellence

Performance Considerations:
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent CloudFormation stack reconciliation
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during large-scale operations
- Efficient credential management for Service Catalog operations
- Memory-optimized data structures for large product inventories
- Queue-based worker architecture for scalable stack reconciliation

Deletion Safety Features:
- Explicit deletion flags (+delete) for Service Catalog product cleanup
- Error and taint status detection for safe automated cleanup
- CloudFormation stack validation before product termination
- Comprehensive logging of deletion operations for audit trails
- Safety controls to prevent accidental product termination

Threading Architecture:
- Worker thread pool for concurrent CloudFormation stack reconciliation
- Queue-based task distribution for efficient stack discovery
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking
- Graceful degradation for stack access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS Service Catalog and CloudFormation API interactions
- account_class for AWS account access management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and stack discovery
- colorama for enhanced output formatting
- tqdm for progress tracking

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-account Service Catalog product discovery across organizations
- Integration with AWS Config for product configuration monitoring
- Product optimization recommendations for cost and governance
- Automated product lifecycle management and policy enforcement
