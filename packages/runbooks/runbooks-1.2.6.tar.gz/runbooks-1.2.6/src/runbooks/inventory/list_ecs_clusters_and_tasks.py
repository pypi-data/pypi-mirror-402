AWS ECS Clusters, Services, and Tasks Discovery and Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and inventory capabilities for Amazon
Elastic Container Service (ECS) resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions.
It's designed for enterprise container platform teams who need visibility into
containerized workloads, service distribution, and task management across large-scale
AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account ECS cluster discovery using assume role capabilities
- Multi-region scanning with configurable region targeting
- ECS service enumeration with detailed metadata extraction
- ECS task inventory with state tracking and resource utilization
- Container workload analysis and capacity planning support
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Container platform inventory and governance across organizations
- ECS service distribution analysis for load balancing optimization
- Task resource utilization tracking for cost optimization
- Capacity planning for containerized workloads
- Compliance reporting for container security and configuration standards
- Multi-account container orchestration visibility
- Disaster recovery planning with service distribution analysis

Container Platform Features:
- ECS cluster enumeration with capacity provider analysis
- Service discovery with task definition and deployment tracking
- Task inventory with container instance placement and resource allocation
- Service health monitoring and availability analysis
- Container resource utilization tracking across accounts
- Load balancer integration analysis for service endpoints

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account ECS access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no container modification capabilities
- Respects ECS service permissions and cluster access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging

ECS Resource Analysis:
- Cluster capacity and utilization metrics for planning
- Service scaling configuration and deployment strategy analysis
- Task placement constraints and resource requirements tracking
- Container instance distribution across availability zones
- Service mesh and load balancer integration visibility

Performance Considerations:
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent ECS API operations
- Progress tracking with tqdm for operational visibility during long operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account container access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large container inventories
- Queue-based worker architecture for scalable discovery operations

Threading Architecture:
- Worker thread pool with configurable concurrency (max 25 threads)
- Queue-based task distribution for efficient resource discovery
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS ECS API interactions
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- threading and queue for concurrent processing architecture
- colorama for enhanced output formatting and tqdm for progress tracking

Future Enhancements:
- ECS task definition analysis and security compliance checking
- Container image vulnerability scanning integration
- Service mesh configuration analysis
- Auto-scaling configuration and recommendation engine
- Cost optimization recommendations based on resource utilization
