#     Perform a DuckDuckGo search focused on the C2 Platform website.

#     This function appends "site:c2platform.org" to the provided search string to
#     restrict the results to the C2 Platform documentation site. The website is
#     available in two languages: English (default) and Dutch. Providing a search
#     string such as "What is C2 Platform" will return a specified number of
#     results, with the top result typically being "https://c2platform.org". If
#     the search string specifies a language, such as "What is C2 Platform?
#     language:nl", the top result would likely be the language-specific page,
#     such as "https://c2platform.org/nl".

#     Args:
#         search_string (str): The query string to search the C2 Platform website.
#         max_results (int, optional): Maximum number of search results to return.

#               like 'href', the URL of the page.
