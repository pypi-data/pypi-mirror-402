"""
This module provides functionality to scan directories and process files according to defined workflows and tasks.
It uses various utility functions and modules to handle file processing, including integration with OpenAI agents,
regex replacements, file read/write operations, and PlantUML processing. The main operations are facilitated
through the 'scan' method, which iterates over configured workflows and their associated tasks, performing necessary
file manipulations as specified.
