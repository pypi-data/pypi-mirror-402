# This file lists file patterns that should be ignored by Git.
# Personal ignore patterns, which are not under version control and
# shared with other users, can be added to the .git/info/exclude file.
# See also `man gitignore` for more information.

# Ignore top-level hidden files by default.  If such a file needs to be
# tracked by Git, an exception should be added using the "!" notation.
