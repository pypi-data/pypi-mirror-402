    # Notes for tinkering with this wrapper:
    # LKH offers the option to define the available edges set from a sparse graph:
    # EDGE_DATA_SECTION, along with EDGE_DATA_FORMAT={ADJ_LIST, EDGE_LIST}. This is
    # very hard to use with TYPE set to ACVRP or OVRP. It seems like LKH expects the
    # edges to be defined wrt the transformed problem, but no reference is available
    # as to how that transformation is carried out (and the C code lacks comments).
    #
    # An option to define the candidate set of edges is alternatively available through
    # EDGE_FILE. Besides applying to the transformed problem, it follows the Concorde
    # format, which has indices starting at 0.
