# v0.1.6

[Commit history since v0.1.5](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/OptiWindNet/-/compare/v0.1.5...v0.1.6)

Drop-in replacement for v0.1.5. This release provides maily two important fixes:
- fix bugs caused by ortools v9.15.6755 released on 2026-01-12
- remove a duplicate turbine from the included location Gangkou 2

In addition, the graph attribute 'creator' of solutions produced by OWN was reverted back to using the naming convention adopted in earlier OWN versions, which includes the 'pyomo' string if the solver was called through it (e.g. 'MILP.pyomo.cplex' instead of 'MILP.cplex').

# v0.1.5

[Commit history since v0.1.4](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/OptiWindNet/-/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5)

Drop-in replacement for v0.1.4.

## Features
- Added new offshore wind locations: Dogger Bank B/C, Coastal Virginia, Inch Cape, Changhua 1, Gangkou 1/2, Yunlin, Noirmoutier, Tréport, Borkum Riffgrund 3, He Dreiht.
- Experimental **FiberSCIP (fscip)** solver support (system call, file-based interface).
- Improved automatic `landscape_angle` calculation
- Added `as_obstacle_free()` method to remove location obstacles; improved `as_single_root()`.
- `.osm.pbf` parsing now prioritizes tag `ref` over `name` for node labels.

## Fixes
-  Fixed dangling reference in diagonals (`make_planar_embedding()`) which could cause errors when checking for crossings.
- Applied rounding in `_link_val()`/`_flow_val()` for MILP Solvers CPLEX and SCIP to eliminate tiny non-zero values (error manifested as cyclic solutions).
- Corrected setting of `B` in `L_from_windIO()`.
- Resolved `_hull_processor()` edge case (wrong P for Yunlin).
- Ensured roots are added to solution topology `S` even if disconnected.
- Enforced integer values for SCIP model variables.
- Updated deprecated Shapely `buffer()` argument name.
- Adjusted graph attributes in MILP solvers.
- Multiple robustness improvements in tests and solver handling.

Drop-in replacement for v0.1.3.

- gplot() and svgplot() now draw links with different line thickness to represent cable type (after assign_cables() is called)
- improve number formatting inside infobox of gplot() and svgplot()

- refactor MILP code for reducing code duplication and improving consistency between model descriptions for the different APIs
- add information on how to install missing solvers when a requested solver is not available
- bump dependency NetworkX version to 3.6 (resolves pickling issues with nx.PlanarEmbedding)
- update the documentation to reflect the changes involving solver SCIP and plotting functions
- fix the assignment of graph attributes 'creator' (all solvers) and 'runtime' (scip)
