This module allows to automatically assigns analytic distributions to
purchase order lines based on the warehouse of the picking type.

This module extends analytic distribution models to support
warehouse-based automatic assignment in purchase orders. When you create
a purchase order, the system automatically applies the appropriate
analytic distribution based on the destination warehouse.

2. Create a new distribution model or edit an existing one
3. Set the **Warehouse** field to specify which warehouse this model
   applies to
4. Configure your analytic accounts and percentages
5. Save the model

Usage
=====

The module works automatically:

1. Create a purchase order
2. Add products to order lines
3. The system automatically applies analytic distribution based on the

possible if needed.
