        ### 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.
        This Agreement (including this Section 12) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. You and Licensor agree that, except as provided below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this Agreement or the use of the Software (each a “Claim”), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted in New York unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth herein and the JAMS Rules, the terms herein will control and prevail. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each party may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, (a) you and Licensor may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. You and Licensor agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Licensor and you individually. YOU AND LICENSOR LEGALLY AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION. You and Licensor agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Licensor’s intellectual property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief.
        
        ### 9. US Government Restricted Rights.
        The Software is provided with "RESTRICTED RIGHTS." Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in applicable laws and regulations. Use of the Software and related materials by the U.S. Government constitutes acknowledgment of Licensor’s proprietary rights in same.

# Rhino Health SDK

Programmatic interface for interacting with the **Rhino Health** Federated Learning Platform.

## Example Usage
Please see the sample notebook files provided to you by the Rhino Health Team for additional use cases.

### Create a session

```python
import rhino_health

my_username = "rhino_user@rhinohealth.com" # Replace me
my_password = "ASecurePasswordYouSet321" # Replace me
session = rhino_health.login(username=my_username, password=my_password)
```

There will be three ways to interact with the API after you have a session
1. Use defined endpoints under lib/endpoints for single actions
2. Use our library functions for commonly performed advanced features
3. Use our low level API Interface (advanced users)

### Interact with the API via defined endpoints

We've included convenience functions for our most commonly used endpoints in the library with required input and output
data classes. These can be found in `rhino_health/lib/endpoints`.

```python
my_projects = session.project.get_projects()
my_first_project = my_projects[0]
my_first_project.add_collaborator(collaborating_workgroup_uid)

my_dataset = session.dataset.get_dataset(my_dataset_uid)
dataset_project = my_dataset.project
my_dataset_info = my_dataset.dataset_info
```

### Library Functions

RhinoHealth also provides library functions which combine our basic building blocks to perform common actions.

Example:
```python
from rhino_health.lib.metrics import RocAucWithCI

metric_configuration = RocAucWithCI(y_true_variable="label", y_pred_variable="pred", confidence_interval=95, timeout_seconds=600)
"""
data_filters=[{
        "filter_column":"is_roc",
        "filter_value":1
    }]
"""
result = my_dataset.get_metric(metric_configuration)
print(f"{result.output}")
```

### Interact using the low level API

Please contact us for support with interacting with our low level API.

### Rate Limits
The Rhino SDK handles rate limits of the API for you if you use the same session between threads and will attempt to queue requests.
Excess requests will be sent with exponential backoff. If you send requests to our server from multiple locations
then you may run into exceptions.

## Development Notes

You may need to use `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir` on M1 Macs
