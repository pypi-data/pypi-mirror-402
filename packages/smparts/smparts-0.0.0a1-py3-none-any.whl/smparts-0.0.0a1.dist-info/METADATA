## SMparts

This project is bootstrapped from the PyPA template:
https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/

SMparts is a lightweight Python package collecting small, carefully designed building blocks for composing **state machines** and **token-driven transducers**.

The goal is to provide minimal yet precise components with clear semantics, formal-style documentation, and executable examples.
