# Digital Marketplace developer tools

Common developer tooling for Digital Marketplace repos.

## Quickstart

Install [the digitalmarketplace-developer-tools package from PyPI][package] and
run Invoke in a Digital Marketplace repo to see what tasks are available:

```
$ pip install digitalmarketplace-developer-tools
$ invoke --list
```

## Stuff in this repo

### Invoke tasks

Developers on the Digital Marketplace need to be able to easily set-up a
developer environment for a repo, so they can quickly start making changes to
the code.

Traditionally this need has been met with `make`, however on the Digital
Marketplace we are starting to use [Invoke][pyinvoke] instead.

Invoke lets us write tasks once and use them for multiple repos. Being written
in Python, we can create a library of tasks and publish them on PyPI for reuse.
The [package for this repo][package] includes these tasks.

To start using the tasks in a repo, add a `tasks.py` file and import the
collection of tasks appropriate for the repo. For instance, for a frontend app:

```
# tasks.py
from dmdevtools.invoke_tasks import frontend_app_tasks as ns
```

The `as ns` part is needed so that the `invoke` command line tool sees the
imported tasks, read the [Invoke documentation on collections and
namespaces][1] for more details on how this works.

For backwards-compatibility, `make` can still be used for a repo. Just copy the
[`Makefile` from this repo](Makefile) (or just the `%` goal), and any
unrecognised goals will be sent to `invoke`.

## Pre-commit hooks

This project has a [pre-commit hook][pre-commit hook] to do some general file checks and check the `pyproject.toml`.
Follow the [Quick start][pre-commit quick start] to see how to set this up in your local checkout of this project.
