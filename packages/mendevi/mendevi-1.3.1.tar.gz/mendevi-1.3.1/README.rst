Description
===========

This Python module performs **energy** and **metrics** measurements on video, for encoding and decoding.
It also provides several detailed **dataset** and a visualisation tool that generates complex matplotlib figures.

It manages the following parameters:

#. It supports the ``libx264``, ``libopenh264``, ``libx265``, ``libvpx-vp9``, ``libaom-av1``, ``libsvtav1``, ``librav1e`` and ``vvc`` cpu encoders.
#. It supports the ``h264_nvenc``, ``hevc_nvenc``, ``av1_nvenc`` and ``*_vaapi`` gpu encoders.
#. Distortions are measured using the ``lpips``, ``psnr``, ``ssim``, ``vif`` and ``vmaf`` metrics.
#. Complexity are measured using the ``rms_sobel`` and ``rms_time_diff`` metrics.
#. Encoding efforts are ``fast``, ``medium`` and ``slow``.
#. It takes care about the colorspaces (``range``, ``transfer`` and ``primaries``).
#. Iterate over different ``effort``, ``encoder``, ``mode``, ``quality``, ``threads``, ``fps``, ``resolution`` and ``pix_fmt``.
#. Energy measurements are catched with ``RAPL`` and an external wattmeter on ``grid'5000``.
#. Get the ``cpu``, ``gpu``, ``ram`` and ``temperature`` activity.
#. Get a full environment context, including hardware and software version.
#. It support the mode (constant bitrate) ``cbr`` and (constant quality) ``vbr``.
#. Ability to ``modify ffmpeg commands`` on the fly to perform specific tests.
#. It take care to ``transfer files to RAM`` if possible to avoid biases related to storage space access.
#. Provides a guide to compile ffmpeg with all optimizations in order to ``compare encoders/decoders at their limits``.

Example of result
=================

Example of rate distortion curve:

.. code:: shell

    mendevi plot mendevi.db -x bitrate -y psnr -y ssim -wx profile -c encoder

    :alt: Result plot of rate distortion

Example of energy per encoder:

.. code:: shell

    mendevi plot mendevi.db -x quality -y energy -wx profile -wy mode -c encoder -m effort

Alternatives
============

#. The `GREEM <https://github.com/cd-athena/GREEM>`_ video encoding measurement tool.
#. The `MVCD database <https://github.com/cd-athena/MVCD>`_ also includes video encoding and decoding energy measurements.
#. The `COCONUT database <https://github.com/cd-athena/COCONUT>`_ also includes video decoding measurements.
#. The `SEED and VEED dataset <https://github.com/cd-athena/VEED-dataset>`_ offers a comprehensive LCA and GPU measurements.
#. The `CTC videos <https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/ReferenceSequences/>`_ and `Big Buck Bunny <https://media.xiph.org/BBB/>`_ are used for the tests.
