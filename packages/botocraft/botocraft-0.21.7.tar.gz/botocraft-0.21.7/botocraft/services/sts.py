        Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These
        temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use
        ``AssumeRole`` within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of ``AssumeRole`` with other API
        operations that produce temporary credentials, see `Requesting Temporary Security
        Credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html>`_ and `Compare STS
        credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_sts-comparison.html>`_ in the *IAM User
        Guide*.

        Args:
            RoleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
            RoleSessionName: An identifier for the assumed role session.

        Keyword Args:
            PolicyArns: The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session
                policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.
            Policy: An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.
            DurationSeconds: The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900 seconds (15
                minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value
                from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is
                lower), the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set
                the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.
            Tags: A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value.
                For more information about session tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services STS Sessions
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html>`_ in the *IAM User Guide*.
            TransitiveTagKeys: A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key as
                transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
                `Chaining Roles with Session Tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-
                tags_role-chaining>`_ in the *IAM User Guide*.
            ExternalId: A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the
                administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in
                the ``ExternalId`` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account
                role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might
                send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the
                role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see `How to Use an External
                ID When Granting Access to Your Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third Party
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for- user_externalid.html>`_ in the *IAM User
                Guide*.
            SerialNumber: The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the
                ``AssumeRole`` call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that
                requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as ``GAHT12345678``)
                or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user``).
            TokenCode: The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA. (In
                other words, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if
                the ``TokenCode`` value is missing or expired, the ``AssumeRole`` call returns an "access denied" error.
            SourceIdentity: The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the ``AssumeRole`` operation. The
                source identity value persists across `chained role
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-role-chaining>`_ sessions.
            ProvidedContexts: A list of previously acquired trusted context assertions in the format of a JSON array. The
                trusted context assertion is signed and encrypted by Amazon Web Services STS.
