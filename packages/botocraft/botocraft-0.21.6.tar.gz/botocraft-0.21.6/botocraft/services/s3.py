        Args:
            model: The :py:class:`Object` to create.
            Bucket: The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

        Keyword Args:
            ACL: The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see `Canned ACL
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            Body: Object data.
            CacheControl: Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see

                editor.org/rfc/rfc6266#section-4>.
            ContentEncoding: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms
                must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
                <https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#field.content-encoding>.
            ContentLanguage: The language the content is in.
            ContentLength: Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body cannot be determined
                automatically. For more information, see <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-length>.
            ContentMD5: The Base64 encoded 128-bit ``MD5`` digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864.
                This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was originally
                sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For
                more information about REST request authentication, see `REST Authentication
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`_.

            ChecksumCRC32C: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32C`` checksum of the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ChecksumCRC64NVME: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same
                data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit ``CRC64NVME`` checksum of the
                object. The ``CRC64NVME`` checksum is always a full object checksum. For more information, see `Checking object
                integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-
                integrity.html>`_.
            ChecksumSHA1: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit ``SHA1`` digest of the object. For more
                information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-
                integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ChecksumSHA256: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 256-bit ``SHA256`` digest of the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            Expires: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more information, see <https://www.rfc-
                editor.org/rfc/rfc7234#section-5.3>.
            IfMatch: Uploads the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during the WRITE operation matches the ETag
                of the object in S3. If the ETag values do not match, the operation returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error.
            IfNoneMatch: Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the bucket specified.
                Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error.
            GrantFullControl: Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
            GrantRead: Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
            GrantReadACP: Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
            GrantWriteACP: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
            WriteOffsetBytes: Specifies the offset for appending data to existing objects in bytes. The offset must be equal to
                the size of the existing object being appended to. If no object exists, setting this header to 0 will create a new
                object.
            Metadata: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
            ServerSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or
                Amazon FSx.
            WebsiteRedirectLocation: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another
                object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
                For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and Metadata
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            SSECustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, ``AES256``).
            SSECustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value
                is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
                appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.
            SSECustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this
                header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
            SSEKMSKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key
                doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.
            SSEKMSEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption
                context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON,
                which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored as object metadata and automatically
                gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future ``GetObject`` operations on this object.
            BucketKeyEnabled: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side
                encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
            RequestPayer: Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
                specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled,
                the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from
                Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User
                Guide*.
            ObjectLockMode: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
            ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire. Must be formatted as
                a timestamp parameter.
            ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus: Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more information about
                S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`_ in the *Amazon
                S3 User Guide*.
            ExpectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match
                the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

        End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists
        (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an
        ``HTTP 405`` (Method Not Allowed) error.

        Args:
            model: The :py:class:`Object` to update.
            Bucket: The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

        Keyword Args:
            ACL: The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see `Canned ACL
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            Body: Object data.
            CacheControl: Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see
                <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9>.
            ContentDisposition: Specifies presentational information for the object. For more information, see <https://www.rfc-
                editor.org/rfc/rfc6266#section-4>.
            ContentEncoding: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms
                must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
                <https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#field.content-encoding>.
            ContentLanguage: The language the content is in.
            ContentLength: Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body cannot be determined
                automatically. For more information, see <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-length>.
            ContentMD5: The Base64 encoded 128-bit ``MD5`` digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864.
                This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was originally
                sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For
                more information about REST request authentication, see `REST Authentication
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`_.

            ChecksumCRC32: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32`` checksum of the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ChecksumCRC32C: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32C`` checksum of the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ChecksumCRC64NVME: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same
                data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit ``CRC64NVME`` checksum of the
                object. The ``CRC64NVME`` checksum is always a full object checksum. For more information, see `Checking object
                integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-
                integrity.html>`_.
            ChecksumSHA1: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit ``SHA1`` digest of the object. For more
                information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-
                integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ChecksumSHA256: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
                that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 256-bit ``SHA256`` digest of the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            Expires: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more information, see <https://www.rfc-
                editor.org/rfc/rfc7234#section-5.3>.
            IfMatch: Uploads the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during the WRITE operation matches the ETag
                of the object in S3. If the ETag values do not match, the operation returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error.
            IfNoneMatch: Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the bucket specified.
                Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error.
            GrantFullControl: Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
            GrantRead: Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
            GrantReadACP: Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
            GrantWriteACP: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
            WriteOffsetBytes: Specifies the offset for appending data to existing objects in bytes. The offset must be equal to
                the size of the existing object being appended to. If no object exists, setting this header to 0 will create a new
                object.
            Metadata: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
            ServerSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or
                Amazon FSx.
            WebsiteRedirectLocation: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another
                object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
                For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and Metadata
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            SSECustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, ``AES256``).
            SSECustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value
                is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
                appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.
            SSECustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this
                header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
            SSEKMSKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key
                doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.
            SSEKMSEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption
                context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON,
                which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored as object metadata and automatically
                gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future ``GetObject`` operations on this object.
            BucketKeyEnabled: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side
                encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
            RequestPayer: Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
                specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled,
                the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from
                Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User
                Guide*.
            Tagging: The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For example,
                "Key1=Value1")
            ObjectLockMode: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
            ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire. Must be formatted as
                a timestamp parameter.
            ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus: Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more information about
                S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`_ in the *Amazon
                S3 User Guide*.
            ExpectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match
                the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

        """
        Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each request. You can use the request parameters as
        selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A ``200 OK`` response can contain valid or invalid
        XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. For more
        information about listing objects, see `Listing object keys
        programmatically <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ListingKeysUsingAPIs.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3
        User Guide*. To get a list of your buckets, see
        `ListBuckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`_.

        Args:
            Bucket: **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-
                style requests   in the format  ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``. Path-style requests are
                not supported.   Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket
                names must follow the   format  ``bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`` (for example,  ``amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--
                x-s3``). For information   about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming   rules
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User
                Guide*.

        Keyword Args:
            Delimiter: A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.
            EncodingType: Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the `object keys
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>`_ in the response. Responses are encoded
                only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain
                characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0,
                you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about
                characters to avoid in object key names, see `Object key naming guidelines
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines>`_.
            MaxKeys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key
                names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.
            Prefix: Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.
            ContinuationToken: ``ContinuationToken`` indicates to Amazon S3 that the list is being continued on this bucket with
                a token. ``ContinuationToken`` is obfuscated and is not a real key. You can use this ``ContinuationToken`` for
                pagination of the list results.
            FetchOwner: The owner field is not present in ``ListObjectsV2`` by default. If you want to return the owner field
                with each key in the result, then set the ``FetchOwner`` field to ``true``.
            StartAfter: StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3 starts listing after this
                specified key. StartAfter can be any key in the bucket.
            RequestPayer: Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request in V2
                style. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.
            ExpectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match
                the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).
            OptionalObjectAttributes: Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do
                not specify are not returned.

        Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

        Args:
            Bucket: The name of the destination bucket.
            CopySource: Specifies the source object for the copy operation. The source object can be up to 5 GB. If the source
                object is an object that was uploaded by using a multipart upload, the object copy will be a single part object
                after the source object is copied to the destination bucket.
            Key: The key of the destination object.

        Keyword Args:
            ACL: The canned access control list (ACL) to apply to the object.
            CacheControl: Specifies the caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
            ChecksumAlgorithm: Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum for the object. For
                more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-
                object-integrity.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            ContentDisposition: Specifies presentational information for the object. Indicates whether an object should be
                displayed in a web browser or downloaded as a file. It allows specifying the desired filename for the downloaded
                file.
            ContentEncoding: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms
                must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
            ContentLanguage: The language the content is in.
            ContentType: A standard MIME type that describes the format of the object data.
            CopySourceIfMatch: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
            CopySourceIfModifiedSince: Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
            CopySourceIfNoneMatch: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.
            CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince: Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
            Expires: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
            GrantFullControl: Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
            GrantRead: Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
            GrantReadACP: Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
            GrantWriteACP: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
            IfMatch: Copies the object if the entity tag (ETag) of the destination object matches the specified tag. If the ETag
                values do not match, the operation returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error. If a concurrent operation occurs
                during the upload S3 returns a ``409 ConditionalRequestConflict`` response. On a 409 failure you should fetch the
                object's ETag and retry the upload.
            IfNoneMatch: Copies the object only if the object key name at the destination does not already exist in the bucket
                specified. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error. If a concurrent operation occurs during
                the upload S3 returns a ``409 ConditionalRequestConflict`` response. On a 409 failure you should retry the upload.
            Metadata: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
            MetadataDirective: Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or replaced with metadata that's
                provided in the request. When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (the default) or specify new
                metadata. If this header isn’t specified, ``COPY`` is the default behavior.
            TaggingDirective: Specifies whether the object tag-set is copied from the source object or replaced with the tag-set
                that's provided in the request.
            ServerSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3. Unrecognized
                or unsupported values won’t write a destination object and will receive a ``400 Bad Request`` response.
            StorageClass: If the ``x-amz-storage-class`` header is not used, the copied object will be stored in the
                ``STANDARD`` Storage Class by default. The ``STANDARD`` storage class provides high durability and high
                availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class.
            WebsiteRedirectLocation: If the destination bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object
                copy to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
                object metadata. This value is unique to each object and is not copied when using the ``x-amz-metadata-directive``
                header. Instead, you may opt to provide this header in combination with the ``x-amz-metadata-directive`` header.
            SSECustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, ``AES256``).
            SSECustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value
                is used to store the object and then it is discarded. Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
                appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.
            SSECustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this
                header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
            SSEKMSKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT
                requests for an object protected by KMS will fail if they're not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information about
                configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see `Specifying
                the Signature Version in Request Authentication
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version>`_ in the *Amazon S3
                User Guide*.
            SSEKMSEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption
                context to use for the destination object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string
                holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
            BucketKeyEnabled: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side
                encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3
                Bucket Key for the object.
            CopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example,
                ``AES256``).
            CopySourceSSECustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source
                object. The encryption key provided in this header must be the same one that was used when the source object was
                created.
            CopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3
                uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
            RequestPayer: Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
                specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled,
                the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from
                Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User
                Guide*.
            Tagging: The tag-set for the object copy in the destination bucket. This value must be used in conjunction with the
                ``x-amz- tagging-directive`` if you choose ``REPLACE`` for the ``x-amz-tagging-directive``. If you choose ``COPY``
                for the ``x-amz-tagging-directive``, you don't need to set the ``x-amz-tagging`` header, because the tag-set will be
                copied from the source object directly. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters.
            ObjectLockMode: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the object copy.
            ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: The date and time when you want the Object Lock of the object copy to expire.
            ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus: Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the object copy.
            ExpectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide
                does not match the actual owner of the destination bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403
                Forbidden`` (access denied).
            ExpectedSourceBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected source bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide
                does not match the actual owner of the source bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden``
                (access denied).

        Zone storage class. You can use ``RenameObject`` by specifying an existing
        object’s name as the source and the new name of the object as the destination
        within the same directory bucket.

        Args:
            Bucket: The bucket name of the directory bucket containing the object.
            Key: Key name of the object to rename.
            RenameSource: Specifies the source for the rename operation. The value must be URL encoded.

        Keyword Args:
            DestinationIfMatch: Renames the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during the operation matches the
                ETag of the object in S3. The ``If-Match`` header field makes the request method conditional on ETags. If the ETag
                values do not match, the operation returns a ``412 Precondition Failed`` error.
            DestinationIfNoneMatch: Renames the object only if the destination does not already exist in the specified directory
                bucket. If the object does exist when you send a request with ``If-None-Match:*``, the S3 API will return a ``412
                Precondition Failed`` error, preventing an overwrite. The ``If-None-Match`` header prevents overwrites of existing
                data by validating that there's not an object with the same key name already in your directory bucket.
            DestinationIfModifiedSince: Renames the object if the destination exists and if it has been modified since the
                specified time.
            DestinationIfUnmodifiedSince: Renames the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
            SourceIfMatch: Renames the object if the source exists and if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified ETag.
            SourceIfNoneMatch: Renames the object if the source exists and if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
                specified ETag. If an asterisk (``*``) character is provided, the operation will fail and return a ``412
                Precondition Failed`` error.
            SourceIfModifiedSince: Renames the object if the source exists and if it has been modified since the specified time.
            SourceIfUnmodifiedSince: Renames the object if the source exists and hasn't been modified since the specified time.
            ClientToken: A unique string with a max of 64 ASCII characters in the ASCII range of 33 - 126.

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Args:
            Bucket: The bucket name that contains the objects.

        Keyword Args:
            Delimiter: A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between
                the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in
                ``CommonPrefixes``. These groups are counted as one result against the ``max-keys`` limitation. These keys are not
                returned elsewhere in the response.
            EncodingType: Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the `object keys
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>`_ in the response. Responses are encoded
                only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain
                characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0,
                you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about
                characters to avoid in object key names, see `Object key naming guidelines
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines>`_.
            KeyMarker: Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.
            MaxKeys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key
                names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search
                criteria, but were not returned because ``max-keys`` was exceeded, the response contains
                ``<isTruncated>true</isTruncated>``. To return the additional keys, see ``key-marker`` and ``version-id-marker``.
            Prefix: Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to
                separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using ``prefix`` to make groups in the same
                way that you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can use ``prefix`` with ``delimiter`` to roll up numerous objects
                into a single result under ``CommonPrefixes``.
            VersionIdMarker: Specifies the object version you want to start listing from.
            ExpectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match
