# sbilby

`sbilby` is a Python package built on top of the **bilby** ecosystem, providing tools for gravitational-wave data analysis and inference, with optional integration of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LAL) software stack.

The package is designed to be installable via **pip**, while allowing advanced functionality when LAL is available.
