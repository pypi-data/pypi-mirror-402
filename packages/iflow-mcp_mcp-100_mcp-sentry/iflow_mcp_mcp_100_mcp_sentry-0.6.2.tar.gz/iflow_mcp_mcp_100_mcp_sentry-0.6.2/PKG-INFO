## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install mcp-sentry for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@qianniuspace/mcp-sentry):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @qianniuspace/mcp-sentry --client claude
```

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-sentry*.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-sentry` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-sentry
```

or use uv
```
uv pip install -e .
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_sentry
```

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-sentry --auth-token YOUR_SENTRY_TOKEN --project-slug YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --organization-slug YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/sentry
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-sentry --auth-token YOUR_SENTRY_TOKEN --project-slug YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --organization-slug YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG  
```
or in term
```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /Volumes/ExtremeSSD/MCP/mcp-sentry/src run mcp_sentry --auth-token YOUR_SENTRY_TOKEN
--project-slug YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG --organization-slug YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG
```
