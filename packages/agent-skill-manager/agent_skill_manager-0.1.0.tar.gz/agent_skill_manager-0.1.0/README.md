sm update --all

# Deploy local skills to agents
sm deploy

# Uninstall a skill (safe delete)
sm uninstall

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sm download` | Download a skill from GitHub |
| `sm deploy` | Deploy local skills to agents |
| `sm install` | Download and deploy in one step |
| `sm uninstall` | Remove skills (safe delete/hard delete) |
| `sm restore` | Restore deleted skills from trash |

| `sm update --all` | Update all GitHub-sourced skills |
| `sm list` | Show installed skills with versions |

## Usage Examples

### Install a skill from GitHub

```bash
sm install
# Enter URL: https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main/skills/example-skill
# Follow the prompts to save locally and deploy
```

### Update all skills

```bash
sm update --all
# Automatically updates all skills installed from GitHub
```

### List installed skills with versions

```bash
sm list
# Shows a table for each agent with:
# - Skill Name
# - Version/Updated timestamp
# - Source (GitHub/Local)
# - GitHub URL (for updatable skills)
```

### Safe delete and restore

```bash
# Uninstall with safe delete (default)
sm uninstall

# Restore if needed
sm restore
```

## Version Tracking

The tool uses two methods for version identification:

1. **GitHub Metadata** (for installed skills)
   - Tracks installation and update timestamps
   - Stores repository information
   - Enables automatic updates

2. **File Modification Time** (for local skills)
   - Uses SKILL.md modification time as fallback
   - For skills without metadata

## Directory Structure

### Global Installation
Skills are available to all projects:
```
~/.claude/skills/           # Claude Code
~/.cursor/skills/           # Cursor
~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/ # Windsurf
# ... other agents
```

### Project Installation
Skills are only available in the current project:
```
project-root/
  .claude/skills/
  .cursor/skills/
  # ... other agents
```

## Configuration

Each skill installed from GitHub includes metadata in `.skill_metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "source": "github",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/...",
  "owner": "user",
  "repo": "repo-name",
  "branch": "main",
  "path": "skills/skill-name",
  "installed_at": "2026-01-20T14:30:52+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-20T14:30:52+00:00"
}
```

## Development

```python
"agent-id": {
    "name": "Agent Name",
    "project": ".agent/skills/",
    "global": "~/.agent/skills/",
}
```

### Running Tests
