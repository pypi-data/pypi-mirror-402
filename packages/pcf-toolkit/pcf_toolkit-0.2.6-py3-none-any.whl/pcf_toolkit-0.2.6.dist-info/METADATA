## ![Quick Start](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quick%20Start-4%20steps-059669?style=for-the-badge&logo=serverless&logoColor=white)

1. Install (recommended): `uv tool install pcf-toolkit@latest`
2. Initialize a proxy config: `pcf-toolkit proxy init`
3. Build your control so `out/controls/{PCF_NAME}` exists.
4. Start the proxy: `pcf-toolkit proxy start MyComponent`

Run without install (useful in CI or scripts):
```bash
uvx pcf-toolkit --help
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.13
- `uv` (recommended for install/run)
- `mitmproxy` (required for proxy mode; auto-installed if `auto_install: true`)
- Optional: Microsoft PAC CLI (`pac`) for environment discovery

- Provider: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Triggers: pushes to `main`, PRs targeting `main`, and tags starting with `v`.
- Build steps: install uv, install Python 3.13, sync deps, build schema snapshot and JSON schema.
- Guardrail: `git diff --exit-code` ensures generated schema artifacts are committed.
- Tests: `pytest` with coverage report (terminal output only).
- Publish: on tags `v*`, builds and publishes to PyPI with `uv publish`.

- Optional: Microsoft PAC CLI (`pac`) for environment discovery and selection.
- The proxy expects your control to build into `bundle.dist_path` (defaults to `out/controls/{PCF_NAME}`).

- Use `pcf-toolkit proxy doctor` to check ports, mitmproxy, certs, and dist paths.
- Active proxy sessions store PID metadata in `.pcf-toolkit/proxy.session.json`.
- Detached runs write logs to `.pcf-toolkit/proxy.log`.

- CLI: Typer-based commands in `pcf_toolkit.cli` and `pcf_toolkit.proxy.cli`.
- Manifest tooling: Pydantic models validate YAML/JSON and serialize deterministic XML.
- Proxy workflow: `mitmproxy` addon rewrites PCF webresource requests to a local `http.server` instance.
- Schema pipeline: scripts extract and normalize Microsoft Learn references into JSON Schema and snapshots.
