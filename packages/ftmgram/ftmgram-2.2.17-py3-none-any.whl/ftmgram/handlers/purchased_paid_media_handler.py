class PurchasedPaidMediaHandler(Handler):
    """The Bot Business Connection handler class. Used to handle new bot business connection.
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.on_bot_purchased_paid_media` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new PaidMediaPurchased arrives. It takes *(client, purchased_paid_media)*
            as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of callback queries to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~ftmgram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the message handler.

        purchased_paid_media (:obj:`~ftmgram.types.PaidMediaPurchased`):
            A user purchased paid media with a non-empty payload sent by the bot in a non-channel chat.
