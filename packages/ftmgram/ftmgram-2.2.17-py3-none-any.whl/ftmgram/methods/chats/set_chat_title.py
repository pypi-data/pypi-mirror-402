        """Change the title of a chat.
        Titles can't be changed for private chats.
        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.

        Note:
            In regular groups (non-supergroups), this method will only work if the "All Members Are Admins"
            setting is off.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            title (``str``):
                New chat title, 1-255 characters.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~ftmgram.types.Message` | ``bool``: On success, a service message will be returned (when applicable),
            otherwise, in case a message object couldn't be returned, True is returned.

        Raises:
