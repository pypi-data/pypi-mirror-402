        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            topic_ids (``int`` | Iterable of ``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a single topic identifier or an iterable of topic ids (as integers) to get the information of the
                topic themselves.

            a list, a single topic is returned, otherwise a list of topics is returned.
