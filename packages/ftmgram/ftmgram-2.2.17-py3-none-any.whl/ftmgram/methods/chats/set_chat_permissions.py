        You must be an administrator in the group or a supergroup for this to work and must have the
        *can_restrict_members* admin rights.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            permissions (:obj:`~ftmgram.types.ChatPermissions`):
                New default chat permissions.

            use_independent_chat_permissions (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if chat permissions are set independently.
                Otherwise, the can_send_other_messages and can_add_web_page_previews permissions will
                imply the can_send_messages, can_send_audios, can_send_documents, can_send_photos, can_send_videos, can_send_video_notes, and can_send_voice_notes permissions;
                the can_send_polls permission will imply the can_send_messages permission.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~ftmgram.types.Chat`: On success, a chat object is returned.

        Example:
