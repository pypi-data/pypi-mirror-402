        Service messages, paid media messages, giveaway messages, giveaway winners messages, and invoice messages can't be copied. A quiz poll can be copied only if the value of the field ``correct_option_id`` is known to the bot.

        The method is analogous to the method :meth:`~Client.forward_messages`, but the copied message doesn't have a
        link to the original message.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~ftmgram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~ftmgram.types.MessageEntity`):
                List of special entities that appear in the new caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            show_caption_above_media (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True, if the caption must be shown above the message media. Ignored if a new caption isn't specified.

            video_cover (``str`` | :obj:`io.BytesIO`, *optional*):

                New start timestamp, from which the video playing must start, in seconds for the copied video in the message.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.

                Description of the message to reply to

                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,

                You can use this to send the message on behalf of a chat or channel where you have appropriate permissions.
                Use the :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.get_send_as_chats` to return the list of message sender identifiers, which can be used to send messages in the chat, 
                This setting applies to the current message and will remain effective for future messages unless explicitly changed.
                To set this behavior permanently for all messages, use :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.set_send_as_chat`.

            protect_content (``bool``, *optional*):

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ValueError: In case if an invalid message_id was provided.
