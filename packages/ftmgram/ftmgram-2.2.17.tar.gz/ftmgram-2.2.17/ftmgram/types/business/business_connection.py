    """Describes the connection of the bot with a business account.

    Parameters:
        id (``str``):
            Unique identifier of the business connection
        
        user (:obj:`~ftmgram.types.User`):
            Business account user that created the business connection

        user_chat_id (``int``):
            Identifier of a private chat with the user who created the business connection. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.

        date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`):
            Date the connection was established in Unix time

        rights (:obj:`~ftmgram.types.BusinessBotRights`, *optional*):
            Rights of the business bot.

        is_enabled (``bool``):
            True, if the connection is active
