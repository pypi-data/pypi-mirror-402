            Pass a file_id as string to send a video that exists on the Telegram servers or
            pass a file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine or
            pass a binary file-like object with its attribute “.name” set for in-memory uploads or

        thumb (``str`` | :obj:`io.BytesIO`):
            Thumbnail of the video sent.
            The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.

            By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.

        caption_entities (List of :obj:`~ftmgram.types.MessageEntity`):
            List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

        show_caption_above_media (``bool``, *optional*):
            Pass True, if the caption must be shown above the message media.

        width (``int``, *optional*):
            Video width.

        file_name (``str``, *optional*):
            File name of the video sent.
            Defaults to file's path basename.

        supports_streaming (``bool``, *optional*):
            Pass True, if the uploaded video is suitable for streaming.

        has_spoiler (``bool``, *optional*):
            Pass True if the photo needs to be covered with a spoiler animation.

        disable_content_type_detection (``bool``, *optional*):
            Pass True, if the uploaded video is a video message with no sound.
            Disables automatic server-side content type detection for files uploaded using multipart/form-data. Always True, if the document is sent as part of an album.
        
        cover (``str`` | :obj:`io.BytesIO`, *optional*):
            Cover for the video in the message. pass None to skip cover uploading.
