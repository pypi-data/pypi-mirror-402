class PollHandler(Handler):
    """The Poll handler class. Used to handle polls updates.

    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~ftmgram.Client.on_poll` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new poll update arrives. It takes *(client, poll)*
            as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`Filter`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of polls to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~ftmgram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the poll handler.

        poll (:obj:`~ftmgram.types.Poll` | :obj:`~ftmgram.types.PollAnswer`):
            New poll state. Bots receive only updates about manually stopped polls and polls, which are sent by the bot.
            A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new votes only in polls that were sent by the bot itself.
