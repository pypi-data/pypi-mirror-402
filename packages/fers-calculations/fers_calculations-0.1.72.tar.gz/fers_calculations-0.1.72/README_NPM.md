# @ferscloud/fers-calculation

High-performance structural / mechanical engineering calculations compiled from Rust to WebAssembly.

This package is the WebAssembly build of your Rust solver so it can be used from JavaScript and TypeScript (browser apps with a bundler, and in some Node.js setups). It is designed to take structured input (for example JSON) and return results efficiently.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ferscloud/fers-calculation
