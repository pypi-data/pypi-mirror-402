    Warning type:   * `NO_AVAILABLE_TRANSPORT` - the order cannot be fulfilled, since there is no available (by shift limitations) transport   * `NO_AVAILABLE_PERFORMER` - the order cannot be fulfilled, since there is not a single available (by shift limitations) performer   * `NO_COMPATIBLE_TRANSPORT` - the order cannot be completed, since there is not a single compatible (in terms of capacity and \\ or compatibility tags) transport   * `NO_COMPATIBLE_PERFORMER` - the order cannot be completed, since there is not a single compatible (by compatibility tags) performer   * `NO_AVAILABLE_ORDER_FOR_TRANSPORT` - the transport is useless, since there are no compatible (by capacity and/or compatibility tags) orders   * `NO_AVAILABLE_ORDER_FOR_PERFORMER` - the performer is useless, since there are no compatible (by capacity and/or compatibility tags) orders   * `NO_COMPATIBLE_ORDER_FOR_TRANSPORT` - the transport is useless, since there are no available (by shift restrictions) orders   * `NO_COMPATIBLE_ORDER_FOR_PERFORMER` - the performer is useless, since there are no available (by shift restrictions) orders   * `PICKUP_AND_DROP_VIOLATION` - for each cargo within the order there must be exactly one loading and exactly one unloading (except for `PICKUP_TO_BOX` and `DROP_FROM_BOX` orders)   * `PICKUP_AND_DROP_VIOLATION_PRECEDENCE_IN_ORDER` - for each cargo within the order, loading must go before unloading (`precedence_in_order`)   * `PICKUP_AND_DROP_VIOLATION_PRECEDENCE_IN_TRIP` - conflicting requirements for the precedence of orders were specified (`precedence_in_trip`)   * `VIOLATION_PRECEDENCE_IN_TRIP_AND_ORDER` - requirements for the precedence of orders in the trip (`precedence_in_trip`) and in the order (` precedence_in_order`) contradict each other   * `TIME_WINDOW_VIOLATION` - the start time of the time window is later than the end time of the window or time window exceeds the maximum allowed   * `DURATION_VIOLATION` - duration does not correspond to the allowed interval   * `ORDER_WINDOWS_INTERSECTION_VIOLATION` - soft windows should not go beyond the boundaries of the hard window   * `PERFORMER_SHIFTS_INTERSECTION_VIOLATION` - time ranges of the performer's work shifts must not overlap, the beginning of the next window cannot be equal to the end of the previous one   * `TRANSPORT_SHIFTS_INTERSECTION_VIOLATION` - time ranges of transport work shifts should not overlap, the beginning of the next window cannot be equal to the end of the previous one   * `LOCATION_WINDOWS_INTERSECTION_VIOLATION` - time ranges of working windows of one location should not intersect, the beginning of the next window cannot be equal to the end of the previous one   * `NO_TRANSPORT_BOXES` - if there are orders with cargo, then the transport must have at least one box   * `MAX_CAPACITY_VIOLATION` - `max_capacity` limit exceeds the total capacity of all boxes or set for only one box or less than the capacity of some box   * `MAX_BOXES_VIOLATION` - limit `max_boxes` is greater than or equal to the total number of boxes or specified for one box or equal to zero   * `TOO_MANY_CARGOS_FOR_DROP_VIOLATION` - the number of loads for an order of the` DROP` / `DROP_FROM_BOX` type must be no more than one   * `EMPTY_CARGOES_LIST` - empty list of loads for orders of type `DROP` / `DROP_FROM_BOX` / `PICKUP` / `PICKUP_TO_BOX`   * `CARGO_WORK_VIOLATION` - for a `WORK` order, the cargo list must be empty   * `GEODATA_TIME_WINDOW_VIOLATION` - the planning horizon exceeds the maximum available value   * `SHIFT_RESTRICTIONS_COULD_BE_MORE_PRECISE` - the working window `working_window` of the change of the artist does not lie entirely inside the window of availability `availability_window`   * `DURATION_DOES_NOT_FIT_INTO_HARD_WINDOW` - the duration of the event does not fit into the hard time window   * `DURATION_DOES_NOT_FIT_INTO_SOFT_WINDOW` - the duration of the event does not fit into the soft time window   * `EXTRA_DURATION_DOES_NOT_FIT_INTO_SOFT_WINDOW` - additional time for demand execution does not fit into the soft time window   * `MAX_CALCULATION_TIME_VIOLATION` - the maximum allowable calculation time has been exceeded   * `MAX_WAITING_TIME_VIOLATION` - the maximum allowable waiting time in queue has been exceeded   * `INVALID_HARDLINK` - it is impossible to assign an order with demands with the `WORK` type to transport   * `CARGO_BOX_VIOLATION` - for requests of all types except `DROP_FROM_BOX` the key of the box where the cargo is located must be empty   * `CARGO_MULTIBOX_VIOLATION` - for an order of type `DROP_FROM_BOX` the indicated cargoes are in boxes of different vehicles   * `CARGO_CAPACITY_VIOLATION` - the specified cargo on board exceeds the size of the box in which it is located   * `CARGO_ORDER_VIOLATION` - the cargo specified in the order is not present in orders   * `FEATURE_LIFETIME_VIOLATION` - feature time windows intersect with each other or the working window `working_window` for changing the performer or transport does not intersect with the feature time window   * `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` - service quota exceeded   * `MAX_LOCATIONS_LIMITS_PENALTY_EXCEEDED` - the resulting solution does not satisfy the `max_locations_limits_penalty` requirement   * `REMOVED_ITEMS_NOT_EMPTY` - during data validation, items were removed from the original dataset, the list of removed items is in the `removed_items` object   * `INCOMPATIBLE_REQUIREMENTS` - incompatible requirements are specified: location load accounting and soft window optimization.
