## 🪄 Usage

You can install RinUI via pip:
```bash
pip install RinUI
```

Import RinUI in your QML file:
```qmllang
import RinUI
```
Then you can run the QML file in your project.
```python
import sys
from RinUI import *
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    your_app = RinUIWindow("/path/to/your/file.qml")
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

You also can view the demo in the source code, like this:
```bash
cd examples
python gallery.py
```

You also can move the RinUI folder to anywhere in your project's directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation is still in progress!!
> You can view the source code to learn more about the components and themes at the moment.

Now you can learn more about RinUI components and themes in [the online documentation](https://ui.rinlit.cn/).
