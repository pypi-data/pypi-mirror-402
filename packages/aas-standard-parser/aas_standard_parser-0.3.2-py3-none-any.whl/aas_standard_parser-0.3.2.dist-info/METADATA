This project provides tools for parsing and handling Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard submodels, with a focus on AID and AIMC submodels. It enables:

- Extraction, interpretation, and mapping of submodel elements and their properties
- Working with references, semantic IDs, and submodel element collections
- Representation and processing of mapping configurations and source-sink relations
- Structured and colored logging, including log file management

These components enable efficient parsing, transformation, and analysis of AAS submodels in Python-based workflows.
> **Note:** Most functions in this project utilize the [python aas sdk framework](https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core3.0-python) for parsing and handling AAS submodels, ensuring compatibility with the official AAS data models and structures.
---

## Provided Parsers

- **AID Parser**: Parses AID submodels to extract interface descriptions, properties, and security/authentication details.
- **AIMC Parser**: Parses AIMC submodels to extract and process mapping configurations and source-sink relations.
- **AAS Parser**: Utilities to extract submodel IDs from an Asset Administration Shell.
- **Submodel Parser**: Helpers to retrieve submodel elements by semantic ID or by path within a submodel.

## Helper Modules

- **Collection Helpers**: Functions to search and filter submodel elements by semantic ID, idShort, or supplemental semantic ID within collections.
- **Reference Helpers**: Utilities for working with references, such as constructing idShort paths and extracting values from reference keys.
- **Utilities**: General utility functions, including loading a submodel from a file.
