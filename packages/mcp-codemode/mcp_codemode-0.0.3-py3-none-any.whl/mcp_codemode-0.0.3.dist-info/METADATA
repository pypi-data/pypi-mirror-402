# 🔧 MCP Codemode

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mcp-codemode)](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-codemode)

**Code Mode for MCP Tools**: Programmatically call and compose MCP tools through code execution instead of individual LLM tool calls.

## Overview

MCP Codemode enables a "Code Mode" pattern where AI agents write Python code that orchestrates multiple MCP tool calls, rather than making individual tool calls through LLM inference. This approach is:

- **More efficient**: Reduce LLM calls for multi-step operations
- **More reliable**: Use try/except for robust error handling
- **More powerful**: Parallel execution with asyncio, loops, conditionals
- **More composable**: Save reusable patterns as skills

## Configuration highlights

- **Direct tool calls**: `allow_direct_tool_calls` (default: false). When false, `call_tool` is hidden and all execution flows through `execute_code`.
- **Tool listing filters**: `list_tool_names` accepts `server`, `keywords`, and `limit` for fast, filtered discovery.
- **Search rerank hook**: Provide an optional `tool_reranker` callable to reorder search results before they are returned (e.g., LLM-based rerankers). Falls back to registry order when not provided.
- **Execution language**: `execute_code` runs Python inside the configured sandbox; import bindings from `generated.servers.<server_name>`.
- **Safety cap**: `max_tool_calls` can limit the number of tool invocations per `execute_code` run.
- **Tool examples**: tool discovery and details include `output_schema` and `input_examples` to improve parameter accuracy.
- **Deferred tools**: tools may be marked `defer_loading` by servers. `list_tool_names` excludes them by default; `search_tools` includes them unless `include_deferred=false`.

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
pip install mcp-codemode
\`\`\`

## Quick Start

\`\`\`python
from mcp_codemode import ToolRegistry, CodeModeExecutor, MCPServerConfig

# Set up registry with MCP servers
registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.add_server(MCPServerConfig(
    name="filesystem",
    transport="stdio",
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
))
await registry.discover_all()

# Execute code that composes tools
async with CodeModeExecutor(registry) as executor:
    result = await executor.execute("""
        from generated.servers.filesystem import read_file, write_file
        
        # Read multiple files
        content1 = await read_file({"path": "/tmp/file1.txt"})
        content2 = await read_file({"path": "/tmp/file2.txt"})
        
        # Process and combine
        combined = content1 + "\\n---\\n" + content2
        
        # Write result
        await write_file({"path": "/tmp/combined.txt", "content": combined})
    """)
\`\`\`

## Features

### Progressive Tool Discovery

Use the Tool Search Tool to discover relevant tools without loading all definitions upfront:

\`\`\`python
# Search for tools matching a description (includes deferred tools)
result = await registry.search_tools("file operations", limit=10, include_deferred=True)

for tool in result.tools:
    print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}")

# Fast listing (deferred tools excluded by default)
names = registry.list_tool_names(limit=50)
\`\`\`

### Code-Based Tool Composition

Execute Python code in an isolated sandbox with auto-generated tool bindings:

\`\`\`python
async with CodeModeExecutor(registry) as executor:
    execution = await executor.execute("""
        import asyncio
        from generated.servers.filesystem import ls, read_file
        
        # List all files
        files = await ls({"path": "/data"})
        
        # Read all files in parallel
        contents = await asyncio.gather(*[
            read_file({"path": f}) for f in files
        ])
    """, timeout=30.0)

# Standard outputs are available on the execution object
print(execution.stdout)
print(execution.stderr)
print(execution.text)
\`\`\`

### Skills (Reusable Compositions)

Skills are Python files that compose tools into reusable operations. This allows agents to evolve their own toolbox by saving useful code patterns.

#### Creating Skills as Code Files

The primary pattern is skills as Python files in a `skills/` directory:

```python
# skills/batch_process.py
"""Process all files in a directory."""

async def batch_process(input_dir: str, output_dir: str) -> dict:
    """Process all files in a directory.
    
    Args:
        input_dir: Input directory path.
        output_dir: Output directory path.
    
    Returns:
        Processing statistics.
    """
    from generated.servers.filesystem import list_directory, read_file, write_file
    
    entries = await list_directory({"path": input_dir})
    processed = 0
    
    for entry in entries.get("entries", []):
        content = await read_file({"path": f"{input_dir}/{entry}"})
        # Process content...
        await write_file({"path": f"{output_dir}/{entry}", "content": content.upper()})
        processed += 1
    
    return {"processed": processed}
```

#### Using Skills in Executed Code

Skills are imported and called like any Python module:

```python
# In executed code
from skills.batch_process import batch_process

result = await batch_process("/data/input", "/data/output")
print(f"Processed {result['processed']} files")
```

#### Composing Skills

Skills can import and use other skills:

```python
# skills/analyze_and_report.py
"""Analyze data and generate a report."""

async def analyze_and_report(data_dir: str) -> dict:
    from skills.batch_process import batch_process
    from skills.generate_report import generate_report
    
    # First process the files
    process_result = await batch_process(data_dir, f"{data_dir}/processed")
    
    # Then generate a report
    report = await generate_report(f"{data_dir}/processed")
    
    return {"processed": process_result["processed"], "report": report}
```

#### Managing Skills

```python
from mcp_codemode.skills import SkillDirectory, setup_skills_directory

# Initialize skills directory
skills = setup_skills_directory("./workspace/skills")

# List available skills
for skill in skills.list():
    print(f"{skill.name}: {skill.description}")

# Search for relevant skills
matches = skills.search("data processing")

# Create a new skill programmatically
skills.create(
    name="my_skill",
    code='async def my_skill(x: str) -> str: return x.upper()',
    description="Transform text to uppercase",
)
```

### MCP Server

Expose Code Mode capabilities as an MCP server:

\`\`\`python
from mcp_codemode import codemode_server, configure_server

configure_server()
codemode_server.run()
\`\`\`

Tools exposed:
- \`search_tools\` - Progressive tool discovery
- \`execute_code\` - Run code that composes tools
- \`call_tool\` - Direct tool invocation
- \`save_skill\` / \`run_skill\` - Skill management

## Key Concepts

### Tool Discovery

Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront (which can overwhelm context), use the Tool Search Tool pattern for progressive discovery based on the task at hand.

### Tool Composition

Compose tools through code instead of reading all data into LLM context. This is faster, more reliable (no text reproduction errors), and more efficient.

### Control Flow

Code allows models to implement complex control flow: loops, conditionals, waiting patterns, and parallel execution without burning through context with repeated tool calls.

### State Persistence

When running in a sandbox (like mcp-codemode), state can persist on disk. Skills themselves can be saved and composed into increasingly powerful tools.
