# cat-rxn-eng

A Python library for modeling catalysts, simulating reactors, and optimizing catalytic processes.

## Overview

`cat-rxn-eng` is a comprehensive toolkit for modeling, simulating, and analyzing catalytic reaction systems. It provides utilities for thermodynamic calculations, kinetic modeling, reactor simulations, and data analysis across a range of catalytic processes including CO₂ conversion, methanol synthesis, reverse water-gas shift reactions, and multi-phase transformations.

- **Kinetic Modeling**: Tools for power-law, Langmuir-Hinshelwood, and dual-site kinetic models
- **Reactor Simulation**: Support for plug flow reactors (PFR) and other reactor types
- **Thermodynamic Calculations**: Equilibrium and property calculations for chemical species
- **Material Properties**: Catalyst and support material characterization
- **Data Analysis**: Plotting and analysis utilities for experimental and simulated data
- **Configuration Management**: Organized configuration system for reaction parameters

## Usage Examples

### Basic Kinetic Modeling

```python
from cat_rxn_eng import kinetic_models

# Define and fit power-law kinetic models
model = kinetic_models.PowerLawModel(...)
fitted_params = model.fit(experimental_data)
```

### Reactor Simulation

```python
from cat_rxn_eng import simulate, reactors

# Simulate a plug flow reactor
pfr = reactors.PlugFlowReactor(...)
results = simulate.run_pfr_simulation(pfr, feed_conditions)
```

### Thermodynamic Calculations

```python
from cat_rxn_eng import species

# Get thermodynamic properties
co2 = species.Species('CO2')
h2 = species.Species('H2')
equilibrium = species.calculate_equilibrium([co2, h2])
```
