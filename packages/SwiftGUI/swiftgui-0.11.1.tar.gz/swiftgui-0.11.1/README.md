
# SwiftGUI

A python-package to easily create user-interfaces (GUIs).

While most packages focus either on small, or big applications, SwiftGUI does both.

## Compatible with Python 3.10 and above
Has some minor optimizations when running in Python 3.12+.

# Getting started / documentation
[Start your journey here](https://github.com/CheesecakeTV/SwiftGUI-Docs/blob/main/01%20Basic%20tutorials/01%20Getting-started.md)

The documentation now has [its own repository](https://github.com/CheesecakeTV/SwiftGUI-Docs).

# Completely vibe-coding free
No AI was used in writing this code.

The only way I used it was to research really specific topics with tkinter.

I did not use it to write, check, correct, or refractor code.

Even the documentation was written completely AI-free.
Takes me around 2 hours per document, but that's a good price for keeping this library slop-free.

# 35 different elements, 9 different canvas-elements
(Version 0.11.0)

`import SwiftGUI as sg`

Call `sg.Examples.preview_all_elements()` for an overview of all the elements.

# Does your GUI look bad?
`import SwiftGUI as sg`

Just call `sg.Themes.FourColors.Emerald()` before creating the layout.

This applies the `Emerald`-theme, my personal favorite.

See which themes are available by calling `sg.Examples.preview_all_themes()`.

#  Alpha-phase!
I am already using SwiftGUI for smaller projects and personally, like it a lot so far.

However, until version 1.0.0, the package is not guaranteed to be fully downward-compatible.
Names and functions/methods might change, which could mess up your code.

For version 1.0.0, I'll sort and standardize names, so they are easier to remember.

Don't worry too much though, it's pretty much ready for beta-phase.
Upcoming changes to existing code will probably be minor.

# Installation
Install using pip:
```bash
pip install SwiftGUI
```

Update for the newest features and elements:
```bash
pip install SwiftGUI -U
```

# NOT a clone of PySimpleGUI
SwiftGUI is it's own package with its own functionality.

I really liked PySimpleGUI (until they went "premium"),
but once you work a lot with it, you'll notice the downsides of it more and more.

**SwiftGUI can be used almost exactly like PySimpleGUI**, but has a lot of additional features.\
Also, SwiftGUI's naming is different sometimes.\
E.g.: `enable_event` is called `default_event`. Makes more sense in my opinion.

There will be a lot of learning-material, including
- Written tutorials (see "getting started" below)
- Video tutorials (Planned for version 1.0.0)
- Application notes, which are short descriptions of actual applications
- Examples, which show an actual application of SwiftGUI
- The GitHub forum ([discussions](https://github.com/CheesecakeTV/SwiftGUI/discussions)) for questions

## Why SwiftGUI instead of PySimpleGUI?
First, note that SwiftGUI can be used almost exactly like PySimpleGUI.\
You won't have to learn everything starting from 0.

I have a lot of experience with `PySimpleGUI`, used it for years.\
It is very useful for smaller applications.

Unfortunately, at a certain level of complexity, you'll hit a wall.\
All those simple features of PySimpleGUI are suddenly big disadvantages.
(There are concrete examples in the readme of the documentation.)

While developing SwiftGUI, I already used it all the time for things previously implemented in PySimpleGUI.
Let me tell you, it's sooooo much more pleasant than PySimpleGUI, even when it was far away from being done.
