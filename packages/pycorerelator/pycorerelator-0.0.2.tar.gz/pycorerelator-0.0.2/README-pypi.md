**pyCoreRelator** is an open-source Python package designed for quantitative stratigraphic correlation across geological core and physical log data. The package performs segment-based (i.e., unit-based or bed-to-bed) correlation analysis by applying Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms for automated signal alignment, while honoring fundamental stratigraphic principles (e.g., superposition, age succession, pinchouts). The main tool computes multiple measures for assessing correlation quality, under the assumption that higher signal similarity indicates stronger correlation. These quality metrics can also be used to identify optimal correlation solutions. In addition, the package provides utility functions for preprocessing log data (e.g., cleaning, gap filling) and core image data (e.g., image stitching, clipping, converting color profiles or scans into digital logs) for use in correlation assessment.

> [!WARNING]
> **pyCoreRelator** is currently under active development and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Please use with caution.

## Installation

### Requirements

## Correlation Quality Metrics

The package computes comprehensive quality indicators for each correlation with enhanced statistical analysis:

### Core Quality Metrics
- **Correlation Coefficient**: [Default] Pearson's r between DTW aligned sequences (higher values indicate better correlation)
- **Normalized DTW Distance**: [Default] Normalized DTW cost per alignment (lower values indicate better correlation)
- **DTW Warping Ratio**: DTW distance relative to Euclidean distance (values closer to 1 indicate less warping)
- **DTW Warping Efficiency**: Efficiency measure combining DTW path length and alignment quality
- **Diagonality Percentage**: Percentage of diagonal steps in DTW path (100% = perfect diagonal alignment)
- **Age Overlap Percentage**: Chronostratigraphic compatibility when age constraints applied

## Main Analysis Functions

### 1. Segment-Based DTW Correlation Analysis

```python
from pycorerelator.analysis import run_comprehensive_dtw_analysis
```

The **dtw_core.py** module performs segment-based (i.e., unit-based or bed-to-bed) correlation analysis by applying Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms for automated signal alignment, while honoring fundamental stratigraphic principles such as superposition, age succession, and pinchouts. The main function `run_comprehensive_dtw_analysis()` computes multiple measures for assessing correlation quality, under the assumption that higher signal similarity indicates stronger correlation. These quality metrics include Normalized DTW Distance, DTW Warping Ratio, DTW Warping Efficiency, Correlation Coefficient, Diagonality Percentage, and Age Overlap Percentage when chronostratigraphic constraints are applied. The module also provides visualization tools for DTW cost matrices, correlation paths, and segment-wise correlations overlaid on log plots.

### 2. Complete DTW Path Finding

```python
from pycorerelator.analysis import find_complete_core_paths
```

The **path_finding.py** module identifies correlation DTW paths spanning entire cores from top to bottom using advanced algorithms with memory optimization. This function is essential for finding all possible correlation solutions that connect the top and bottom of core pairs, considering stratigraphic constraints and user-picked boundaries. The module includes tools for analyzing connectivity gaps, diagnosing chain breaks, and combining multiple path segments into complete correlation solutions.

### 3. Synthetic Stratigraphy Generation

```python
from pycorerelator.analysis import create_synthetic_core_pair, synthetic_correlation_quality
```

The **syn_strat.py** module generates synthetic cores from segment pools for null hypothesis testing. The synthetic stratigraphy generation allows users to test the significance of observed correlations by comparing them against synthetic cores with known properties. The module includes functions for creating segment pools from real data, generating synthetic core pairs, and conducting multi-parameter analysis to assess correlation quality distributions. This method has been applied in stratigraphic correlation studies to evaluate the robustness of correlation solutions and identify optimal parameter combinations.

### 4. Interactive Stratigraphic Boundary Picking

```python
from pycorerelator.preprocessing import pick_stratigraphic_levels
```

The **datum_picker.py** module provides interactive manual stratigraphic boundary picking with real-time visualization and category-based classification. Users can pick stratigraphic boundaries on core logs, assign categories (e.g., turbidite bases, facies transitions), and export the results to CSV files for quality control and further analysis. The module supports multiple log types and includes tools for visualizing picked boundaries alongside core images and log data.

### 5. Machine Learning Data Imputation

```python
from pycorerelator.preprocessing import process_and_fill_logs
```

The **gap_filling.py** module performs advanced ML-based gap filling for core log data using ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) with configurable feature weighting and trend constraints. The module preprocesses core data, trains machine learning models on non-missing values, and fills gaps while maintaining statistical properties and trends in the data. This method has been applied in core log analysis to handle data gaps caused by core recovery issues, measurement artifacts, or missing sections.

### 6. Core Image Processing

```python
from pycorerelator.preprocessing import ct_process_and_stitch, rgb_process_and_stitch
```

The **ct_processing.py** and **rgb_processing.py** modules provide complete workflows for processing CT scan images and RGB core photographs, respectively. These modules include functions for image alignment, stitching, brightness/color profile extraction, and conversion to digital log format. The CT processing module handles DICOM files and extracts brightness logs from CT scans, while the RGB processing module extracts color profiles (RGB, grayscale, hue, saturation, value) from core photographs. Both modules support multi-segment processing and optional CSV export for integration with correlation analysis workflows.
