1.9.x Releases
==============

Datacube-ows version 1.9.x releases are designed to work with datacube-core versions 1.9.x.

1.9.8 (2026-01-19)
------------------

Datacube OWS now supports gthread worker types in gunicorn, as OWS is mostly I/O-bound, this should allow pretty
significant performance improvements.  Lots of minor fixes.

If upgrading from 1.9.5 or earlier, be sure to read and follow the schema update instructions in the release notes
for version 1.9.7.

1.9.7 (2025-12-21)
------------------

Mostly addressing issues in the previous release.

If upgrading, we recommend upgrading to `datacube>=1.9.12` first.

Schema updates are recommended, especially if using the postgis driver.  Only perform the schema updates once all
processes accessing your index have been upgraded to datacube>=1.9.11. Update ODC and OWS schemas as follows:

(NB: use an ODC database environment with database superuser privileges)::

    # Update ODC schema:
    datacube system init
    # Update OWS schema:
    datacube-ows-update --schema

Note that this release drops the separate OWS users - all permissions default to the user (c.f. old read-role),
manage (c.f. old ows write-role), and admin (manage the OWS schema - new feature).

Use::
    datacube user grant [user|manage|admin] <db_username>

instead of the old::
    datacube-ows --read-role <db_username> --write-role <db_username>

If you no longer run OWS 1.8.x versions, now would be a good time to also run::

    # Cleanup OWS 1.8 range tables and materialised views
    datacube-ows-update --cleanup

These schema changes only affects database user permissions and schema management.  A datacube-1.9.12/ows-1.9.7
schema is backwards compatible with earlier versions of datacube and ows. (Note this was advised for the previous
releases as well, but was unfortunately not actually the case for postgis indexes).

1.9.5 (2025-10-21)
------------------

What's Changed
++++++++++++++

Significant changes include:

- Bug fix to CRS handling.  We still prefer upper case CRSs in config, but can now
  handle lower case CRSs in ODC metadata.  A more major overhaul of OWS's CRS handling is still needed.
- Update to latest version of datacube core.
- HTTP requests (e.g. for forwarded logo images) are now retried on failure.

All included updates:

* Manual dependency updates by @pjonsson (#1272, #1284, #1297,  #1313,
* Auto-dependency updates (#1262-#1264, #1268-#1271, #1275-#1278, #1280-#1281, #1283, #1286-#1291, #1293-#1296,

1.8.39 (2024-03-13)
-------------------

Emergency release to complete half-implemented new feature.

The changes to the spatial materialised view introduced in the previous release are now also implemented
in the time materialised view.

Includes contributions from @pindge, @emmaai and @SpacemanPaul.

1.8.34 (2023-03-21)
-------------------

This OWS release includes two significant new features:

1. Timeless mosaic layers.

   The new `mosaic_date_func` configuration option allows the creation of timeless (i.e. single time-slice)
   layers.  The user-provided function returns the start/end date to use for dataset date searches, and a
   mosaic layer is generated, with the most recent available date for any given pixel returned.

2. Enhanced time resolution handling (subday and overlapping summary periods).

   Major refactor of time resolution handling.

   There are now only 3 time resolution options:

   *solar:* Replaces the old "raw" option. Local-solar-day time model, used for imagery captured in daily swathes
   by satellites in heliosynchronous orbits.

   *summary:* Replaces the old "day", "month", and "year" options. Only looks at the "start" datetime, and
   so neatly supports products with overlapping or non-exclusive dataset date-ranges. Expects the time portion
   of the start date to always be "midnight UTC". Used for summary/calculated products.

   *subday:* New option. Used for for products with multiple time values per day (e.g. hourly/minutely data). Uses
   the "start" datetime of the dataset.

   Note that the *solar* and *summary* options explicitly ignore the **time** component of the *time* query parameter
   passed by the user. If you need the time component to be significant, you must use subday.

   The old "raw", "day", "month", "year" time_resolution options are still supported as aliases for the new
   values above.  A deprecation warning will be issued advising you to update your configuration to the new
   values, but the old values will continue to work.  You should not actually move your configuration to
   the new values until after all of your deployment environments have been upgraded v1.8.34.

Full list of changes:

* Increment default version number and update version history (#937)

* Updates to HISTORY.rst, README.rst and default version string for release (#879)

Contributions from @pindge and @SpacemanPaul.

1.8.29 (2022-08-30)
-------------------

This release includes support for heterogenous multi-product layers (single layers that combine data
from satellite platforms with different bands and native resolutions - e.g. Sentinel-2 plus Landsat),
an upgrade to the docker container (now based on Ubuntu 22.04, with Python 3.10), plus documentation updates
and bug fixes.

Full list of changes:

* Enhancements to support heterogenous multi-product layers (#837, #841, #844)
* Refactor data for integration test fixtures (#835)
* Docker image migrated to Python3.10/Ubuntu-22.040-based osgeo/gdal base image, and updates to
  dependencies (#838, #843, #852, #854, #856, #859)
* Isolate ops imports to minimise dependencies for applications only using the styling API (#855)
* Documentation updates and improvements (#846, #847, #848, #849)
* Bug Fix: Skip cached bounding boxes when layer extent is entirely outside the valid region for the CRS (#832)
* Bug Fix: Invalid version parameters in otherwise valid requests were failing with unhandled 500 errors. OWS now
  makes a best-effort guess in this case, tending towards the lowest supported version (#850)
* Bug Fix: response_crs parameter was not being handled correctly by WCS1 (#858)
* Updates to HISTORY.rst and default version string for release (#860)

This release includes contributions from @SpacemanPaul, and @pindge.

1.8.28 (2022-04-12)
-------------------

This release introduces changes to both the materialised view definitions and the ``datacube-ows-update``
utility to improve the accuracy and reliability of these extents, as well as bug fixes for
externally-hosted legend images.

This release includes:

* A bug fix to the OWS code which reads from the materialised views, preventing runtime errors
  from occurring in scenarios where accurate extent information is not available (#825)
* Enhancements to the materialised view definitions to support extracting extent polygons
  from various optional metadata locations in both EO and EO3 based products. (#826)
* Sanity-check and sanitise bounding box ranges for global datasets.  It should now be
  possible to use datasets with bounding box ``(-180, -90, 180, 90, crs=EPSG:4326)`` in
  OWS.  Previously this required hacking the metadata to result in e.g.
  ``(-179.9999, -89.9999, 179.999, 89.999, crs=EPSG:4326)`` (#828)
* Usability improvements for external legends. Clearer reporting of read errors on external
  urls, and raise warning instead of failing if external image format is not PNG. (#829)
* Update HISTORY.rst and default version number (#830)

Upgrade notes:
++++++++++++++

To enjoy all the advantages of these extent handling enhancements you will need to
run the following command, using a database role capable of altering the schema::

     datacube-ows-update --schema --role role_to_grant_access_to

After regenerating the schema, the range tables should also be updated::

     datacube-ows-update

(Note that there is no need to run ``datacube-ows-update`` with the ``--views`` option in between these
two steps.)

1.8.27 (2022-04-04)
-------------------

Several bugfixes, and documentation updates and we had to change our CI test data because the old USGS Landsat PDS went user-pays.

Cache-control hints can now be configured for the XML requests (GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage).  WMS and WCS GetCapabilities can be configured separately.  WCS DescribeCoverage can be configured globally and optionally over-ridden per layer/coverage.   Refer to the documentation for details.

Full list of changes since 1.8.26:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Bug fix: Multidate NetCDF requests were broken in both WCS1 and WCS2- now fixed (#799)
* int8 added as a supported dtype (#801, #802)
* Logging updated to include remote IP (#808,#811,#818)
* Documentation updates (#810, #819, #820)
* Replace USGS Landsat data with Sentinel-2 data for CI integration testing. (#812, #817)
* Bug fix: Manual merge where no extent mask function was broken (#817)
* Cache-control hints for XML requests (GetCapabilities/DescribeCoverage) (#821, #822)
* Update HISTORY.rst and default version number (#823)

1.8.26 (2022-01-31)
-------------------

Optimisation release.  Performance improvements to colour-map style rendering algorithm.
For large, complex value_map rule sets the improvement is dramatic (e.g. DEA LCCS level4 style,
which contains over 100 rules, rendering speed is increased by 70-80%).

* Minor improvements to unit and docker testing (#792, #793)
* Optimisation of colour-map style rendering algorithm (#795)
* Increment default version number and update HISTORY.rst (#797)

1.8.25 (2022-01-19)
-------------------
Bug fix release.

The legend internationalisation code in 1.8.24 caused errors in manual legends for deployments that do not have internationalisation enabled.  This release fixes that issue.

* Legend internationalisation bug fix (#789, #790)
* Update default version number and HISTORY.rst (#791)

1.8.24 (2022-01-18)
-------------------

Introduces support for internationalisation (translation) of style legends - see the documentation for details:

https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#metadata-separation-and-internationalisation
https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_styling.html#url

This is the first formal release since the 9th December, although there were several interim releases in
mid-December when we were testing the Prometheus metric changes (see below).

Due to an oversight in deprecation warnings several releases ago, some configurations that worked in 1.8.23
will now raise errors.  Affected configurations have legacy "legend" hints embedded inside the colour ramp
definitions.  Such hints have not been read by OWS for quite some time, having been replaced by the "tick_labels" entry in the "legend" section.  Digital Earth Australia and Digital Earth Africa configurations have already been updated.

Changes since 1.8.23:

* Prometheus metric enhancements and release notes for interim releases (#777, #778, #779, #780, #781, #782)
* Github integration tests against a large real world OWS configuration (DEA) (#784)
* Internationalisation of style legends. (#783, #786)
* Fix WCS1 DescribeCoverage regression (missing SRS/CRS) (#787)
* Update History.RST and increment default version number (#788)

1.8.23 (2021-11-16)
-------------------

In addition to the standard animated handlers previously supported by all style types, this release
introduces two additional approaches to produce an non-animated image from a multi-date request for
colour-map (aka value_map) type styles:

* Using a variant of the value_map_ entry used for the single-date case. This is a much simpler way of achieving most use cases.
* Using an aggregator function, which allows for fully customisable behaviour but requires writing Python code.

The new behaviour is fully documented here: https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_colourmap_styles.html#multi-date-requests

This means that OWS now supports rich comparison visualisation techniques for both contiguous and discrete data products.

Also, the masking rule parser for pq_masks sections now uses the same code as the parser for value_map rules in colour map styles.

This means that:

* pq_mask rules now supports and/or operators, consistent with value_map rules.
* value_map rules now support the invert operator, consistent with pq_mask rules.
* The old "enum" keyword in pq_masks is now deprecated - please now use the values keyword, as in value_maps.

Full details are in the documentation. Old style syntax will continue to work as before - except the
enum keyword in pq_masks now produces a deprecated warning message.

Please read the release notes before upgrading.

WCS changes
+++++++++++

As more in the community are starting to actively use WCS, we are slowly polishing away the rough edges. This
release has two changes of interest to OWS administrators who use WCS:

1. Firstly, the wcs ``default_bands`` has been removed. The default behaviour for WCS requests that do not specify
   bands is now to return all available bands, as specified in the WCS2 standards.

This means that layer-level ``wcs`` sections is no longer required. If you have any, you will get warning
messages. You can ignore these until you are sure that all your server instances have been upgraded to 1.8.20,
when it is safe to remove the layer ``wcs`` sections from your config to suppress the warning.

2. Secondly, more options are available for resource limiting in WCS. Refer to the documentation for details:

https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#resource-limits-wcs

Docker image base change
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Docker images are now based on ``osgeo/gdal`` instead of ``opendatacube/geobase``. You may need to tweak
your build environment slightly - check your env files against the latest examples.

New in this release
+++++++++++++++++++

* Switch docker base image from geobase to osgeo/gdal. (#727)
* Remove support for wcs ``default_bands`` entry (# 725)
* Extend resource management capabilities for WCS (#730)
* Fixed several corner-case bugs in the color ramp legend generator (#732)
* Add chapter on legend generation to HOWTO (#733, #735)
* Added Security.md file (#734)
* Other improved documentation (#711)
* Fix bug affecting layers with no extent mask function. (#737, #739)
* Increment default version number to 1.8.20 (#738)

1.8.19 (2021-09-20)
-------------------

Improved test coverage and documentation; bug fixes; repo cleanup.

* Improved test coverage (#708, #709, #710)
* Fixed zero-day bug in WMTS GetFeatureInfo (#708)

* Increment version number (#723)


1.8.18 (2021-09-02)

Adds support for dynamic credentials for S3 access.

Thanks to @woodcockr, @valpesendorfer and @pindge.

* Docker-compose fix for v1.29 (#702)
* Add smart resource management data to ows_stats output (#703)
* Renewable S3 credentials (#704, #706)
* Fix bug in direct config inheritance for objects supporting named inheritance (#705)
* Increment default version number (#707)


1.8.17 (2021-08-25)
-------------------

Urgent bug-fix release to address a WCS bug.

This release also contains a couple of minor backwards compatibility issues, see below for details.

Version 1.8.18 will probably follow fairly rapidly as there are a couple of other known issues that
are actively being worked on, see below for details.

Changes:
++++++++

* Cleanup/refactor of styles package: docstrings, type-hints, cleanup and improved test coverage (#695)
* Change default behaviour of ``$AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST`` to match the standard default behaviour for boto3-based applications (#696)
* Fix WCS queries against layers with a flag-band in the main product (#699)
* Increment version number (#700)

Backward Incompatibilities
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. #695 removed support for some legacy legend config formats that have been deprecated (and undocumented)
   for over a year.
2. #696 changes the default behaviour if ``$AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST`` is not set. Previously the default behaviour
   was unsigned requests, it is now signed requests. This was a necessary first-step to supporting dynamic
   credentials for S3 access, and brings OWS into line with other software using boto3 for S3 access.

Known Issues
++++++++++++

1. There are still issues with WCS queries against layers with a flag-band in the main product. These will be
   addressed in the next release and should not effect queries generated by the Terria Export function.
2. Dynamic credentialling for S3 access is still problematic. We have a PR almost ready to merge (#697) but
   it needs further testing.

1.8.16 (2021-08-16)
-------------------

Mostly about implementing smarter resource limiting to make time-series animation production ready.

* Smarter resource limiting (#686, #689, #690)
* docker-compose.yml fixes. (#685)
* Fix typo in ``.env_ows_root`` (#683)
* Remove "experimental" warning on time-series animations (#691)
* Better error reporting of config error cases potentially caused by easy-to-make typos (#692)
* Increment version number (#693)

Note the following changes to configuration introduced in this release. Old configurations should continue to work,
with the backwards-incompatible exceptions noted below, however you may see warning messages on startup advising
which parts of your config are now deprecated and should be updated.

1. ``native_crs`` and ``native_resolution`` were previously part of the ``wcs`` configuration section of layers,
   as they were previously only used for generating WCS metadata. They are now also used by the new
   ``min_zoom_level`` resource limit for WMS/WMTS, and have therefore moved out of the ``wcs`` section and into
   the main layer config section. These entries will continue to be read from the old location with a
   deprecation warning. If present in both locations, the values in the new locations take precedence, and
   the deprecation warning will still be raised.
2. There is a new ``min_zoom_level`` configuration option, which should be considerably easier to set and
   use than ``min_zoom_factor``, as well as being much smarter about how resource requirements for request
   are estimated. ``min_zoom_factor`` is still supported, but will be deprecated in a future release.

Backwards Incompatibility Notes

I try to avoid backwards incompatible changes to config format, but some minor ones were unavoidable in this release:

1. Layers with no CRS and/or resolution defined in the ODC product metadata now ALWAYS require a native CRS and resolution to be defined in configuration. This was previously only the case if WCS was enabled for the layer.
2. The default resource_limiting behaviour for WMS/WMTS has changed from "min_zoom_factor = 300.0" to "no resource limits". Maintaining backwards compatibility would have resulted in confusing and inconsistent behaviour.


1.8.15 (2021-07-30)
-------------------

1.8.15 introduces experimental* support for time-series animations from WMS/WMTS, in APNG format,
and has increased CI test coverage to over 90%.

If you use docker-compose to orchestrate your configuration, you may need to make some changes to
your ``.env`` file after upgrading to this release. See the updated examples and the documentation for details.

Thanks to all contributors, especially @whatnick for the prototype implementation of time-series animation,
and @alexgleith for supplying much needed user-feedback on the CLI interfaces.

(* experimental) = produces a warning message when activated. The existing resource limit implementation is
not suitable for production deployment with time-series animations. I hope to address this in the next release.
