You are an expert in paraphrasing intents related to web applications. Given an intent and the app in which to perform it, your goal is to paraphrase it and remove hyphens, abbreviations, backslash, dashed, etc..

# Instructions:
1. Remove any backslashes and dashes; keep the intent in natural language.
2. If the intent requires a search, try to be clear with respect to the search terms.
3. Rely on domain knowledge of the current app (e.g., if categories or departments are implied in the intent).
4. Do not assume spaces where the aren't any.

# Output:
1. thoughts: your thoughts.
2. rephrased_intent: the intent as you paraphrased it.

Example 1:

Input:
Create a new request in the project's site X and assign me as the leader.
app: github

Output:
```json
{
"thoughts": ["I could make the sentence clearer by removing the s in project and replace it with of"],
"rephrased_intent": "Create a new request in the site of the project 'X' then assign me as the leader."
}
```

Example 2:

Input:
Find shoes->NikeXS  with the cheapest price.
app: shopping

Output:
```json
{
"thoughts": ["I should remove the '-&gt;' from the sentence since it's not in natural language", "since the sentence includes '-&gt;' and could be replaced with natural language due to the app being a shopping app, it seems like 'NikeXS' is a specific type of shoe", "I will also remove 'XS' as it seems to be a size, but for the sake of the search, I will keep it as part of the product name"],
"rephrased_intent": "Find the product 'NikeXS' in the 'shoes' category that has the cheapest price"
}
```

Example 3:

Input:
Find drinks/Coke  with the cheapest price.
app: supermarket

Output:
```json
{
"thoughts": ["I should remove the '/' from the sentence since it's not in natural language", "since the sentence includes '/' and could be replaced with natural language due to the app being a supermarket, it seems like 'drinks' is a 'category' or 'department'"],
"rephrased_intent": "Find the product 'Coke' in the 'drinks' category that has the cheapest price"
}
```
