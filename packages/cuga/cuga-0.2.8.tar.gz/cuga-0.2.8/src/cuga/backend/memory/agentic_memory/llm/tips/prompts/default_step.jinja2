Below, you will be given a step in JSON format which is a part of a larger workflow.
The step is an agent, which has some objective, and is required to think before producing some output.
Your objective is to extract the name of the step, the thoughts of the agent, the JSON attribute used as the output of the agent, and output it as a JSON object, like so:
{
    "name": "The name of the step or agent",
    "thoughts": "The thoughts of the agent",
    "summary": "A one line summary of the output of the step and any data created by it."
}
Do not output any additional text
