**CRITICAL for TaskAnalyzerAgent** :

- If CUGA Agent failed to complete the task and TaskAnalyzer was the root cause, provide recommendation/tips for TaskAnalyzer that it should keep in mind while selecting apps in for similar task in future to avoid such failures.
- If CUGA Agent completed task successfully, provide recommendation/tips what TaskAnalyzer could repeat in future.
- Keep recommendation/tips very precise and short.
- Remember TaskAnalyzer is responsible for just selecting the apps. It does not decide the order. 
- Assume TaskAnalyzer agent has access to all different applications necessary to complete the task.

**COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR**:

- User mentions email operations but TaskAnalyzer doesn't include email app
- User mentions shopping/purchasing but TaskAnalyzer doesn't include shopping apps
- User mentions multiple domains (e.g., "send email about my order") but TaskAnalyzer only includes one app
- Missing applications that are clearly needed based on the task intent
- Task fails later because required apps weren't shortlisted initially

PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO:

- Any mentions in the trajectory of "app not available" or "missing app"
- FinalAnswerAgent saying task couldn't be completed due to missing capabilities
- Task decomposition problems caused by insufficient app shortlisting
