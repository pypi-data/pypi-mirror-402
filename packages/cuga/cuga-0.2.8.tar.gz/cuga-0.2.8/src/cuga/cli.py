      - demo: Starts both registry and demo agent directly (registry on port 8001, demo on port 7860)
      - demo_crm: Starts CRM demo with email MCP, mail sink, and CRM API servers
      - registry: Starts only the registry service directly (uvicorn on port 8001)
      - appworld: Starts AppWorld environment and API servers (environment on port 8000, api on port 9000)
      - memory: Starts the memory service directly (uvicorn on port 8888)
