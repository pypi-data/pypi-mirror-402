When a user asks about family member healthcare information, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Get Primary Member's Plan
- Use the memberId from user context to call `get_plan(member_id)`
- This returns the plan details including plan_type and family_members list

## Step 2: Check Plan Type
- If plan_type is "family", the response includes family_members array
- Each family member has: member_id, name, relationship, date_of_birth

## Step 3: Identify Target Family Member
- Match the requested family member (e.g., "daughter", "son") with the relationship field
- If multiple matches (e.g., two daughters), you may need to ask for clarification
- Use the family member's member_id for subsequent calls

## Step 4: Get Family Member's Information
- Call `get_plan(member_id)` with the family member's ID to get their specific plan details
- Call `get_claims(member_id)` with the family member's ID to get their claims

## Important Notes
- Always start with the primary member's plan to get family member IDs
- Family member IDs are different from the primary member ID
- For individual plans, there are no family_members in the response
