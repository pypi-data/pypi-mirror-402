Here are some useful tips derived from past experiences where your response resulted in overall failure or success. Each tip comprises of:

```json
{
  'intent': <User query in the past>
  'task_status': <If the task completed or failed>
  'failure_reason': <failure reason if the task failed>
  'tip': <Recommendation/tip that could be used to avoid such errors in future.
}
```

{% for tip in tips %}
  {{tip}}
{% endfor %}
