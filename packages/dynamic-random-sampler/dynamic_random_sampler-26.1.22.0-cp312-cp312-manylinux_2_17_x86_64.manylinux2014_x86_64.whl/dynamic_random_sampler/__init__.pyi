"""Dynamic Random Sampler - High-performance weighted random sampling.

class SamplerList:
    """A dynamic weighted random sampler that behaves like a Python list.

    Implements efficient weighted random sampling where each index j is returned
    with probability w_j / sum(w_i). Supports dynamic weight updates in O(log* N)
    amortized expected time.

    Supports most list operations including indexing, slicing, append, extend,
    pop, insert, remove, reverse, sort, and clear. Setting weight to 0 excludes
    an element from sampling but keeps it in the list.

    Examples:
        Basic usage::

            >>> sampler = SamplerList([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
            >>> idx = sampler.sample()  # Returns 0-3, weighted by probability
            >>> sampler[0] = 10.0  # Update weight dynamically
            >>> sampler[1] = 0  # Exclude index 1 from sampling

        Empty sampler::

            >>> sampler = SamplerList()  # Create empty sampler
            >>> sampler.append(1.0)
            >>> sampler.extend([2.0, 3.0])

        Reproducible sampling::

            >>> sampler = SamplerList([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], seed=42)
            >>> results = [sampler.sample() for _ in range(5)]
