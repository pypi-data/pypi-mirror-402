# ADAMIXTURE: Adaptive First-Order Optimization for Biobank-Scale Ancestry Inference

ADAMIXTURE is an unsupervised global ancestry inference method that scales the ADMIXTURE model to biobank-sized datasets. It combines the Expectation–Maximization (EM) framework with the ADAM first-order optimizer, enabling parameter updates after a single EM step. This approach accelerates convergence while maintaining comparable or improved accuracy, substantially reducing runtime on large genotype datasets. For more information, we recommend reading [our pre-print]().

The software can be invoked via CLI and has a similar interface to ADMIXTURE (_e.g._ the output format is completely interchangeable).

## System requirements

### Hardware requirements
The successful usage of this package requires a computer with enough RAM to be able to handle the large datasets the network has been designed to work with. Due to this, we recommend using compute clusters whenever available to avoid memory issues.

### Software requirements

We recommend creating a fresh Python 3.10 virtual environment using `virtualenv` (or `conda`), and then install the package `adamixture` there. As an example, for `virtualenv`, one should launch the following commands:

```console
$ virtualenv --python=python3.9 ~/venv/nadmenv
$ source ~/venv/nadmenv/bin/activate
(nadmenv) $ pip install adamixture
```

## Installation Guide

The package can be easily installed in at most a few minutes using `pip` (make sure to add the `--upgrade` flag if updating the version):

```console
(nadmenv) $ pip install adamixture
```

## Running ADAMIXTURE

To train a model, simply invoke the following commands from the root directory of the project. For more info about all the arguments, please run `adamixture --help`. Note that VCF and BED are supported as of now:

As an example, the following ADMIXTURE call

```console
$ ./admixture snps_data.bed 8 -s 42
```

would be mimicked in ADAMIXTURE by running

```console
$ adamixture --k 8 --data_path snps_data.bed --save_dir SAVE_PATH --init_file INIT_FILE --name snps_data --seed 42
```

Two files will be output to the `SAVE_PATH` directory (the `name` parameter will be used to create the whole filenames):

- A `.P` file, similar to ADMIXTURE.
- A `.Q` file, similar to ADMIXTURE.

Logs are printed to the `stdout` channel by default. If you want to save them to a file, you can use the command `tee` along with a pipe:

```console
$ adamixture --k 8 ... | tee run.log
```
