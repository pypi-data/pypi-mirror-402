Base library for creating new [DHTI](https://github.com/dermatologist/dhti) Elixirs.

[What is DHTI?](https://github.com/dermatologist/dhti) DHTI (Digital Health Tooling Interface) provides building blocks for interoperable, healthcare-focused AI tooling. This repository is the minimal foundation you extend to build your own "Elixir"—a reusable, testable component (chain/agent/server) that plugs into the wider DHTI ecosystem.

Status: WIP, but stable enough to scaffold new Elixirs and iterate quickly.

## Overview

This package exposes lightweight, composable base classes:

- `BaseChain` – a LangChain-compatible chain scaffold with sensible defaults.
- `BaseAgent` – an agent scaffold that can bind tools and work with LangGraph.
- `BaseGraph`, `BaseLLM`, `BaseServer`, `BaseSpace`, and `BaseDhtiModel` – helpers to organize more complex Elixirs.

Use these to rapidly create a new Elixir with a consistent structure, tests, and docs.

### Dependency Injection (mydi.py / di)

The codebase uses a simple dependency injection pattern via `mydi.py` and the `get_di` function. This allows you to:
- Configure FHIR endpoints, authentication, and other settings at runtime
- Swap out implementations for testing or customization
- Keep your code modular and maintainable

### CDS Hook Module (Frontend Integration)

The `cds_hook` module now provides  request parsing and context extraction for CDS Hooks workflows. It supports:
- Parsing various CDS Hooks request formats
- Extracting patient and order context

This enables integration with frontend CDS Hooks clients.

### FHIR Module (Backend Integration: SMART on FHIR & FHIRPath)

The `fhir` module  includes advanced backend features:
- **SMART on FHIR**: The `SmartOnFhirSearch` class provides secure, standards-based access to FHIR resources using OAuth2 and the SMART on FHIR protocol. It supports:
	- Patient-centric resource queries (Conditions, Observations, Procedures, MedicationRequests, AllergyIntolerances)
	- $everything operation for comprehensive patient data
	- Automatic token management and authentication
- **FHIRPath Support**: All resource queries can apply FHIRPath expressions for flexible data extraction and transformation.
