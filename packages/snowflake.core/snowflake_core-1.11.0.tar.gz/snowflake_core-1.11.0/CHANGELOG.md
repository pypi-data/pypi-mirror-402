# Release History

## Unreleased version

### New features

### Bug fixes

## 1.11.0 (2026-01-21)

### New features
* `DAGTask` accepts custom objects with a `to_sql()` method as task definitions
* `UserDefinedFunction` resource now supports executing scalar UDFs via the `execute` method

### Bug fixes
* Creating, fetching, and listing stored procedures that use a staged handler (where the `body` property is empty) will no longer result in a `ValidationError` being raised.
* Pydantic deprecation warnings related to `class-based config` and `update-forward-refs`, `parse_obj`, `_iter` methods will no longer occur.

## 1.10.0 (2025-12-08)

### New features
* Added support for Streamlit resource
* Added support for the DECFLOAT data type

### Bug fixes

## 1.9.0 (2025-11-13)

### New features
* Added support for Artifact Repository resource
* Added support for Network Rule resource
* Added support for Password Policy resource
* Added support for Secret resource
* Added support for Sequence resource
* Added support for Tag resource

### Bug fixes

## 1.8.0 (2025-09-18)

### New features
* Added support for proxy configuration. Proxy settings can be provided by using the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable.

## 1.7.0 (2025-07-31)

### New features
* Added support for three methods of specifying the point of time reference when creating stream using Time Travel (
`PointOfTimeStatement`, `PointOfTimeStream` and `PointOfTimeTimestamp`)

### Bug fixes
* Fixed a warning: 'allow_population_by_field_name' has been renamed to 'validate_by_name'
* Restored the behavior of `drop` method of `DAGOperation` where `drop_finalizer` has to be set to `True` in order
for finalizer task to be dropped. Due to changes in 9.20 Snowflake release `fetch_task_dependents` started returning
finalizer task alongside other tasks belonging to the DAG which caused the finalizer to always be dropped by the
`drop` method.

## 1.6.0 (2025-06-26)

### New features
* Optionalized `query` and `column` parameters in QueryRequest for the Cortex Search Service API.

## 1.5.1 (2025-05-28)

### New features

### Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug in `ProcedureResource` that caused the `call` method to return wrong results when 
  using `extract` option with `ReturnTable` type.
* `CortexInferenceService.complete` can now be called from Python worksheets and notebooks.

## 1.5.0 (2025-05-14)

### New features
* Deprecated `ServiceResource.get_service_status` method in favor of `ServiceResource.get_containers` method.
* Added `extract` option to `procedure.call` method that will extract result from returned payload. For example 
  using `extract=False` (current behavior) causes returning `[{'procedure_name': 42}]` result. In such case using
  `extract=True` will result in returning value of `42`. NOTE: `extract=True` is recommended default, 
  using `extract=False` cause deprecation warning.
* Added support for mapping VARIANT type in stored procedure call.

### Bug fixes
* Fixed type mapping for GEOMETRY, GEOGRAPHY, OBJECT return types in stored procedures.
* `__repr__` implementation for stored procedures and functions will now show a list of arguments in addition to the name.

## 1.4.0 (2025-04-23)

### New features
* Implemented `__repr__` for all collection and resource classes, as well as all model classes.

### Bug fixes
* Changed _SNOWFLAKE_PRINT_VERBOSE_STACK_TRACE to be enabled by default which causes full stack trace to be displayed
  in printed error messages. This change was made to avoid disabling stack traces for all exceptions which happens when
  SNOWFLAKE_PRINT_VERBOSE_STACK_TRACE is not set.

## 1.3.0 (2025-04-09)

### New features
* Added the `snowflake.core.FQN` class that represents an object identifier.
* `DAGOperation.drop` method will drop a finalizer task if `drop_finalizer` argument is set to True.
  * `drop_finalizer` argument will be removed in the next major release and a finalizer task will always be dropped alongside the DAG. 

### Bug fixes

## 1.2.0 (2025-03-26)

### New features
* Added support for asynchronous requests across all the existing endpoints. 
  * Asynchronous methods are denoted by the `_async` suffix in their names and use polling to determine if an operation has completed.
  * The number of calls that can execute in parallel depends on the number of CPUs. The environment variable `_SNOWFLAKE_MAX_THREADS` can be used to change the size of thread pool.
  * Refer to the documentation of the `snowflake.core.PollingOperation` class for example usage.
* Added support for creating serverless Tasks with StoredProcedureCall definition
* Added support for serverless attributes SERVERLESS_TASK_MIN_STATEMENT_SIZE and SERVERLESS_TASK_MAX_STATEMENT_SIZE 
to the Database and Schema resources (dependent on Snowflake 9.8)
* Added support for setting SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES, USER_TASK_MANAGED_INITIAL_WAREHOUSE_SIZE and 
USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS attributes on cloned Databases and Schemas (dependent on Snowflake 9.8)
* Deprecated CortexAgentService.Run in favor of CortexAgentService.run
* Added new optional attributes to various models within the Cortex Search Service API:
  * `text_boosts` and `vector_boosts` to the `Function` model
  * `weights` to the `ScoringConfig` model

### Bug fixes
* It is now possible to call `create_or_alter` with a task object returned from the `iter` method

## 1.1.0 (2025-03-12)

### New features

* Added support for serverless attributes TARGET_COMPLETION_INTERVAL, SERVERLESS_TASK_MIN_STATEMENT_SIZE and 
SERVERLESS_TASK_MAX_STATEMENT_SIZE to the Task resource

### New Features

* Read-only properties are now by default included in dictionaries returned by `to_dict()` from models. This can be toggled by using `to_dict(hide_readonly_properties=True)`.
* The `if_exists` property, which toggles whether an action can be performed without erroring if the given resource does not exist, has been added to the following resources:
    * `drop()` for Database, NetworkPolicy, View, User, ComputePool, ImageRepository, Pipe, Role, Service, Stage, Table, Task, DynamicTable, Role, Alert, Procedure, Warehouse, Schema, Function.
    * `refresh()` for Database and DynamicTable.
    * `suspend()` and `resume()` for Service , DynamicTable, and Warehouse.

## 0.8.1 (2024-05-31)

### New features
* `with_managed_access` is now an available boolean option in `create_or_update` for `SchemaResource`. This is equivalent to the [WITH MANAGED ACCESS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema#optional-parameters) clause in `CREATE SCHEMA`.

    Usage example:

    ```schema.create_or_update(schema_def, with_managed_access = True)```

* Added a `get_endpoints` method for `Service` resources that returns a list of endpoints for a given `Service`.


## 0.8.0 (2024-04-30)

* `create_or_update()` for `Schema`, `Warehouse`, `Database`, `Compute Pool`, resources will (for the time being) not work. `create()` on these resources will still work.  
* Creating tables using `as_select` will no longer carry over information from any source tables used in the `as_select` query.
* `data_retention_time_in_days` and `max_data_extension_time_in_days` properties will be inherited from schema or database settings when not explicitly set in a `create_or_update` statement that alters an existing table.
