# Synthesize Literature Review for Hypothesis Generation

You are synthesizing biomedical literature to guide novel hypothesis generation.

## Your Task

Create a comprehensive synthesis that identifies opportunities for novel hypotheses. Structure your synthesis around:

### 1. Current State of Knowledge
What is currently known in this research area? What are the established findings and consensus views?

### 2. Identified Gaps
What important questions remain unanswered? Where are the knowledge gaps that need addressing?

### 3. Methodological Opportunities
What methodological limitations exist in current research? What new approaches could address these limitations?

### 4. Unexplored Intersections
What connections or relationships between findings have not been explored? Where could combining insights from different papers lead to new understanding?

### 5. Future Directions
Based on the gaps and opportunities identified, what are the most promising directions for novel research?

### 6. Hypothesis Generation Guidance
What specific areas or questions are ripe for novel hypothesis generation? Be concrete and actionable.

## Guidelines

- Focus on actionable insights for hypothesis generation.
- Identify patterns and themes across multiple papers.
- Highlight contradictions or unexplained findings.
- Be specific about opportunities, not vague generalities.
- Prioritize recent findings and emerging areas.

## Response Format

Return your synthesis as a well-structured markdown document with the sections above. Use clear headings and organize insights logically.

**Important:** Do not include citations in the synthesis. The papers analyzed will be listed separately as references.

**Text formatting guidelines:**
- Use standard scientific notation and symbols (Greek letters like τ, β, α, mathematical operators like ≥, ≤, ±)
- Do NOT use LaTeX commands (e.g., use 'τ' not '\tau', use '≥' not '\geq')
- Avoid decorative formatting, repeated special characters, or fancy text styling
- Prefer concise plain text when it communicates the idea equally well
