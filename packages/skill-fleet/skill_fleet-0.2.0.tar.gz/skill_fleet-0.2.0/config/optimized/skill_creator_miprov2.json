Determine if you have at least `min_examples` that cover the \"Happy Path,\" \"Edge Cases,\" and \"Error Boundaries.\"\n2. **Extract & Refine:** \n   - Identify any new `UserExample` objects (input vs. expected output) from the latest user message.\n   - Extract \"Terminology Updates\" for any domain-specific jargon, internal tool names, or DevOps concepts mentioned.\n   - Update the `refined_task` to be more technically descriptive based on these new insights.\n3. **Question Strategically:** If the `readiness_score` is below the threshold, generate 1-3 highly specific questions. Focus on \"Trigger Phrases\" (what the user actually says to the AI), specific tool constraints (e.g., \"Which CI/CD provider?\"), and \"Definition of Done.\"\n4. **Evaluate Readiness:** Assign a `readiness_score` (0.0-1.0). A high score (0.8+) requires that the skill's boundaries (inclusions/exclusions) are now unmistakable and the capability requirements are grounded in the `collected_examples`.\n\n**Constraint:** Do not assume defaults.

Assign a version (starting at `1.0.0`), a skill type (`technical`, `process`, or `domain`), and a load priority.\n2.  **Capability Decomposition**: Break the skill down into 3–7 discrete, testable \"capabilities.\" Each capability must have a clear name, a detailed description, and specific `test_criteria` that define a \"pass\" state for an automated validator.\n3.  **Strict Dependency Mapping**: Formalize the relationships identified in the dependency analysis. Distinguish between `required` dependencies (without which the skill cannot function) and `recommended` ones. Ensure all `skill_id` references are consistent with the taxonomy.\n4.  **Resource & Constraint Definition**: Specify the external environment required for execution, including APIs, CLI tools, and runtime version constraints (e.g., `python_version='>=3.12'`).\n5.  **Composition Strategy**: Write a 1-2 paragraph strategy explaining how this skill serves as a building block for others. Describe its role in the larger ecosystem—whether it acts as a base layer, a logic enhancer, or an integration bridge.\n\n### Formatting Guidelines:\n- **Kebab-case IDs**: All skill IDs and resource names must use `hyphen-separated-strings`.\n- **Granularity**: Capabilities should be specific enough to be unit-tested but broad enough to cover the skill's scope.\n- **Taxonomy Alignment**: Ensure the `taxonomy_path` uses forward slashes and matches the depth indicated in the input.",

        "skill_content": "# React Hooks Management\n\n## Overview\nReact Hooks are the fundamental building blocks for state and lifecycle management in modern functional React components. This skill provides the architectural patterns and implementation logic for managing local state, handling side effects, consuming global context, and optimizing component performance. By abstracting logic into reusable hooks, developers can create highly composable and testable frontend applications.\n\n## Capabilities\n- **State Management**: Implementing local component state using `useState` and complex state logic using `useReducer`.\n- **Effect Synchronization**: Managing side effects, API calls, and manual DOM manipulations using `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`.\n- **Context Consumption**: Accessing global application state and dependency injection via `useContext`.\n- **Custom Hook Abstraction**: Encapsulating complex logic into reusable, shareable functions to maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.\n- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing unnecessary re-renders and expensive computations using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.\n\n## Dependencies\n- `technical_skills/web_development/frontend/react`: Core component lifecycle and JSX syntax.\n- `technical_skills/web_development/languages/javascript`: ES6+ features (destructuring, arrow functions, async/await).\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Custom Fetch Hook\nA reusable pattern for handling asynchronous data fetching with loading and error states.\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(url);\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result);\n      } catch (err) {\n        setError(err);\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n```\n\n### Performance Optimization with useCallback\nPreventing child component re-renders by memoizing callback functions.\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\n\nconst Parent = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  \n  // Memoized function to prevent Child re-renders\n  const increment = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <Child onIncrement={increment} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",

It enables the lifecycle management of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, networking configuration, and observability. This skill serves as the bridge between static configuration files and a running distributed system, allowing for automated infrastructure-as-code (IaC) workflows.\n\n## Capabilities\n- **Apply Manifests**: Declaratively create, update, or delete resources using YAML or JSON manifests.\n- **Manage Workloads**: Handle the lifecycle of Deployments, StatefulSets, and Pods, including scaling and rolling updates.\n- **Configure Networking**: Manage internal and external traffic via Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and Ingress resources.\n- **Secret Management**: Securely inject sensitive data and configuration parameters using Secrets and ConfigMaps.\n- **Cluster Observability**: Inspect cluster health through logs, resource descriptions, and event streams to diagnose issues.\n\n## Dependencies\n- `technical_skills/cloud_infrastructure/container_orchestration` (Parent Context)\n- `kubernetes` (Python library)\n- `kubectl` (CLI tool)\n- `PyYAML` (For manifest parsing)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Applying a Deployment\n```python\nfrom kubernetes import client, config, utils\n\ndef deploy_app(manifest_path):\n    config.load_kube_config()\n    k8s_client = client.ApiClient()\n    utils.create_from_yaml(k8s_client, manifest_path, verbose=True)\n    print(\"Deployment applied successfully.\")\n```\n\n### Scaling a Deployment\n```python\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\n\ndef scale_deployment(name, namespace, replicas):\n    config.load_kube_config()\n    apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n    body = {\"spec\": {\"replicas\": replicas}}\n    apps_v1.patch_namespaced_deployment_scale(name, namespace, body)\n    print(f\"Scaled {name} to {replicas} replicas.\")\n```",

Your objective is to act as the final gatekeeper for the `agentskills.io` platform, ensuring that every generated skill is technically sound, structurally consistent, and ready for production deployment.\n\nPerform a rigorous cross-validation of the provided skill artifacts and generate the following:\n\n1. **Reasoning**: Conduct a step-by-step analysis comparing `skill_content`, `skill_metadata`, and `capability_implementations`. Identify any discrepancies in naming conventions, taxonomy paths, or dependency declarations.\n2. **Validation Report**: Evaluate the skill against the standard schema. \n    - Mark as `passed=True` only if there are no critical errors. \n    - Issue `warnings` for minor inconsistencies (e.g., dependencies listed in Markdown but missing in JSON). \n    - Provide a checklist of specific validations (Schema, Taxonomy, Capability Mapping, Code Linting).\n3. **Integration Tests**: Generate 3-5 concrete `TestCase` objects derived from the usage examples and capability descriptions. Each test must specify clear `input_data` and the `expected_result` to verify the skill's runtime logic.\n4. **Packaging Manifest**: Create a formal inventory of all required files (e.g., `SKILL.md`, `metadata.json`) and generate a unique checksum for the package.\n5. **Quality Score**: Assign a final score (0.0 to 1.0). A high score (0.9+) requires perfect alignment between metadata and documentation, syntactically correct code blocks, and clear compliance with the taxonomy path.\n\nEnsure all outputs adhere strictly to the `agentskills.io` specification, using kebab-case for names and forward-slash notation for taxonomy paths.",
