# Python Asynchronous Programming (asyncio)

## Overview
Asynchronous programming in Python, powered by the `asyncio` library, enables high-performance concurrent execution using a single-threaded event loop. This skill covers the transition from traditional blocking code to non-blocking, cooperative multitasking, allowing for thousands of simultaneous connections without the overhead of heavy threading.

## Core Concepts
- **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` that can be paused and resumed.
- **Event Loop**: The central scheduler that manages and executes asynchronous tasks.
- **Awaitables**: Objects that can be used in an `await` expression (Coroutines, Tasks, Futures).
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Performing input/output operations without stalling the execution of other tasks.

## Key Components
- **Task Management**: Using `asyncio.create_task` for concurrent execution and `asyncio.gather` for aggregating results.
- **Error Handling**: Managing `asyncio.CancelledError` and timeouts to ensure system resilience.
- **Synchronization**: Using async-aware `Locks`, `Semaphores`, and `Queues` to coordinate state between coroutines.
- **Blocking Interop**: Offloading CPU-bound or legacy blocking I/O to threads or processes via `run_in_executor`.
