# Python Core Syntax & Fundamentals

This module provides the foundational syntactic building blocks for Python programming. It covers the essential grammar, data types, and structural patterns required to write idiomatic and performant code according to PEP 8 standards.

## Core Objectives
- **Primitive Mastery**: Proficient use of Python’s dynamic typing and arithmetic operations.
- **Data Structures**: Efficient manipulation of Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
- **Logic & Flow**: Implementation of complex branching and iterative logic.
- **Functional Foundations**: Defining reusable code blocks with proper scope management.
- **Clean Code Standards**: Adherence to PEP 8 for readability and maintainability.

## Directory Structure
- `primitives/`: Type handling, variable assignment, and casting logic.
- `data_structures/`: Collection types and memory-efficient comprehensions.
- `control_flow/`: Logical branching and loop optimizations.
- `functions/`: Parameter passing (args/kwargs) and scope (LEGB rule).
- `standards_and_errors/`: Linting, style guides, and syntax debugging.
