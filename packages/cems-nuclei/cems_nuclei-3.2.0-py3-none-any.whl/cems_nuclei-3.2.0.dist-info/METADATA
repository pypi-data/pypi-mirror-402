This repository is created by [CEMS BV](https://cemsbv.nl/) and helps the user to access and process API calls to
the [NUCLEI](https://nuclei.cemsbv.io/#/) environment.

# Installation

To install this package, including the `NucleiClient` library and its dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install cems-nuclei[client]
```

To skip the installation of the `NucleiClient` library, in case you do not need it (e.g. only use pure requests), run:

```bash
pip install cems-nuclei
```

## ENV VARS

To use `nuclei` add the follow ENV vars to your environment. Or provide them when asked.

```
* NUCLEI_TOKEN
    - Your NUCLEI user token
```

You can obtain your `NUCLEI_TOKEN` on [NUCLEI](https://nuclei.cemsbv.io/#/).
Go to `personal-access-tokens` and create a new user token.

# Contribution

## Environment

We recommend developing in Python3.9 with a clean virtual environment (using `virtualenv` or `conda`), installing the
requirements from the requirements.txt file:

Example using `virtualenv` and `pip` to install the dependencies in a new environment .env on Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .env
source activate .env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

Build the docs:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
sphinx-build -b html docs public
```

Note: You'll need to set the `NUCLEI_TOKEN` environmental variable.
You can get your token at: `https://cemsbv.crux-nuclei.com`

## Format

We format our code with black and isort.

```bash
black --config "pyproject.toml" src/nuclei tests
isort --settings-path "pyproject.toml" src/nuclei tests
```

## Lint

To maintain code quality we use the GitHub super-linter.

To run the linters locally, run the `run_super_linters.sh` bash script from the root directory.

## UnitTest

Test the software with the use of coverage:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .[test]
coverage run -m pytest
```

## Requirements

Requirements are autogenerated by `pip-compile` with python 3.9

```bash
pip-compile --extra=test --extra=docs --extra=lint --extra=client --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```

To update the requirements within the defined ranges, run:

```bash
pip-compile --upgrade --extra=test --extra=docs --extra=lint --extra=client --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```
