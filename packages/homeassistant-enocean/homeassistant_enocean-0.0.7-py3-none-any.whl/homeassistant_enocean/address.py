"""EnOcean address classes for Home Assistant integration.

This module provides the EnOceanAddress class for handling EnOcean four byte (32 bit) addresses,
including parsing, validation, and conversion between integer and string formats.

class EnOceanAddress:
    """Implementation of the EnOcean four byte (32 bit) addresses to identify devices.

    # A note about sending addresses
    Each EnOcean device has a unique ID (called *Chip ID*) which it can use
    for sending telegrams. Alternatively, EnOcean gateways can also use a range
    of 128 consecutive addresses for sending, starting at the so-called
    _Base ID_ of the gateway. A gateway's *Base ID* is a four byte address in
    the range FF:80:00:00 to FF:FF:FF:80. The Base ID is a predefined address,
    which can be changed by the user only a few times (at most 10 times for the
    TCM310 chip). The allowed addresses for sending a telegram are thus the
    following 129 addresses:

    - Chip ID (= device ID),
    - Base ID,
    - Base ID + 1,
    - Base ID + 2,
    - ...
    - Base ID + 126, and
    - Base ID + 127.

    All other addresses must not be used for sending (and will be rejected by
    official EnOcean modules). This is meant as a basic security feature. Have a
    look at the EnOcean [knowledge base](https://www.enocean.com/de/faq-knowledge-base/what-is-difference-between-base-id-and-chip-id/) for the official explanation of the differences between chip ID and base IDs.

    Base IDs are always in the range FF:80:00:00 to FF:FF:FF:80.
