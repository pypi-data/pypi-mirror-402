/// Functions for linear blend skinning (Skeletal Subspace Deformation)
///
/// Linear blend skinning (LBS), also known as Skeletal Subspace Deformation (SSD),
/// is a technique used in character animation to deform a mesh based on an underlying
/// skeleton. Each vertex in the mesh is influenced by one or more joints, with weights
/// determining how much influence each joint has on the vertex's final position.
///
/// This file provides functions to:
/// - Apply forward skinning (transform vertices from bind pose to animated pose)
/// - Apply inverse skinning (transform vertices from animated pose back to bind pose)
/// - Compute inverse skinning transformations for specific vertices
///
/// Key concepts:
/// - Bind pose: The reference pose of the character, where skin weights are defined
/// - Skin weights: Per-vertex weights defining how much influence each joint has
/// - Joint transformations: Current transformations of the skeleton's joints
/// - Forward skinning: Applying joint transformations to deform the mesh
/// - Inverse skinning: Reversing the deformation to return to bind pose

/// Applies forward SSD (linear blend skinning) to points, returning new points
///
/// This overload transforms individual points and returns a new vector of transformed points.
/// Use this when you need to transform arbitrary points without modifying a mesh.
///
/// @param inverseBindPose Inverse bind pose transformations for each joint
/// @param skin Skin weights defining influence of each joint on vertices
/// @param points Input points to transform
/// @param state Current skeleton state containing joint transformations
/// @return Vector of transformed points
