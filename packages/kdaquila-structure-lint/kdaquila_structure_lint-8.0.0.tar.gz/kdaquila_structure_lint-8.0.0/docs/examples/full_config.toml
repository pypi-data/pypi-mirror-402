# Full Configuration Example
#
# This example shows ALL available configuration options with their default values.
# Use this as a reference when customizing your setup.
#
# You don't need to specify every option - only include the ones you want to change
# from their defaults. The configuration system uses deep merging, so any missing
# values will automatically use the defaults shown here.

[tool.structure-lint]
# Master switch to enable/disable entire linter
enabled = true

# Directories to search for source files (relative to project root)
# Supports Python (.py) and TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files
# This applies to ALL validators (line_limits, one_per_file, structure)
# The tool automatically excludes: .venv/, __pycache__/, .git/, node_modules/
search_paths = ["src"]

[tool.structure-lint.validators]
# Control which validators are enabled
structure = false      # Opt-in (default: disabled) - enforces folder structure
line_limits = true     # Default: enabled - enforces max lines per file
one_per_file = true    # Default: enabled - enforces single definition per file

[tool.structure-lint.one_per_file]
# TypeScript folder-specific rules
# These control which folders enforce the one-per-file rule for TypeScript files
ts_fun_in_functions = true   # Enforce 1 function per TS file in _functions folders
ts_fun_in_components = true  # Enforce 1 function per TS file in _components folders
ts_fun_in_hooks = true       # Enforce 1 function per TS file in _hooks folders
ts_cls_in_classes = true     # Enforce 1 class per TS file in _classes folders

# Python folder-specific rules
# These control which folders enforce the one-per-file rule for Python files
py_fun_in_functions = true   # Enforce 1 function per PY file in _functions folders
py_cls_in_classes = true     # Enforce 1 class per PY file in _classes folders

# File exclusion patterns (glob patterns for files to skip)
# TypeScript declaration files are excluded by default
excluded_patterns = ["*.d.ts"]

[tool.structure-lint.line_limits]
# Maximum number of lines allowed per file (Python and TypeScript)
max_lines = 150

[tool.structure-lint.structure]

# Maximum depth of feature folder nesting
# Depth counts from base folder children (depth 0) downward
# Example: src/features/auth/login/ = depth 1
folder_depth = 2

# Standard folders that can appear inside feature/module directories
# These represent common code organization patterns and cannot have subdirectories
# Includes _components and _hooks for TypeScript/React projects
standard_folders = ["_types", "_functions", "_constants", "_tests", "_errors", "_classes", "_components", "_hooks"]

# Files allowed in any directory, even those that normally shouldn't contain files
# Includes index.ts/index.tsx for TypeScript barrel exports (similar to __init__.py)
# Note: Non-source files (like README.md, .gitkeep) are automatically ignored
files_allowed_anywhere = ["__init__.py", "index.ts", "index.tsx"]

# Folder name patterns to ignore during structure validation
# Supports wildcards (e.g., *.egg-info matches my_package.egg-info)
# These are typically cache, build, or tool-generated directories
ignored_folders = [
    "__pycache__",
    ".mypy_cache",
    ".pytest_cache",
    ".ruff_cache",
    ".hypothesis",
    ".tox",
    ".coverage",
    "*.egg-info"

# ============================================================================
# Usage Examples:
# ============================================================================
#
# With this full default configuration, your project structure should look like:
#
# project/
# ├── pyproject.toml          (contains this configuration)
# ├── src/
# │   └── features/           (base folder)
# │       ├── authentication/ (feature directory at depth 0)
# │       │   ├── _types/     (standard folder - Python/TypeScript types)
# │       │   ├── _functions/ (standard folder - functions)
# │       │   ├── _constants/ (standard folder - constants)
# │       │   ├── _tests/     (standard folder - tests)
# │       │   ├── _components/(standard folder - React components, TypeScript)
# │       │   ├── _hooks/     (standard folder - React hooks, TypeScript)
# │       │   └── oauth/      (feature folder at depth 1)
# │       │       ├── _types/
# │       │       └── google/ (depth 2)
# │       │           └── _types/
# │       └── reporting/      (another feature at depth 0)
# │           └── ...
#
# ============================================================================
# Customization Tips:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Start minimal - only specify what you want to change from defaults
# 2. Use comments to document why you chose specific values
# 3. Adjust line_limits.max_lines based on your team's preferences
# 4. Customize standard_folders to match your architecture (e.g., MVC)
# 5. Only include directories you want validated in search_paths
# 6. Adjust folder_depth for deeper or shallower nesting limits
# 7. Disable validators you don't want with false
# 8. Use one_per_file options to customize folder-aware rules for each language
