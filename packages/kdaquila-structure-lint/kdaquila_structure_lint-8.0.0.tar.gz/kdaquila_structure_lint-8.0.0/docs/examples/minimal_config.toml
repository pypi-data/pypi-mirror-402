# Minimal Configuration Example
#
# This is the bare minimum configuration for kdaquila-structure-lint.
# All other settings will use their default values.
#
# Copy this section to your pyproject.toml file to enable the linter.

[tool.structure-lint]
enabled = true

# That's it! With just this single line, you get:
#
# Validators enabled:
#   - line_limits: true (max 150 lines per file)
#   - one_per_file: true (single definition per file)
#   - structure: false (opt-in only)
#
# Search paths (applies to ALL validators):
#   - src/  (default)
#
# This minimal config is perfect for:
# - Quick setup and evaluation
# - Projects that align with defaults
# - Getting started before customizing
#
# To customize search paths, add:
#   search_paths = ["src", "lib"]  # Unified for all validators
