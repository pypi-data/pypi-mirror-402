    Parameters
    ----------

        Number of pixels.
    waveforms : Union[List[Waveform], Tuple[Waveform]]
        List of `Waveform` instances, one for each channel.

        Trigger channels index.
    sampling_channels : List[int]
        Sampling channels index.

    **Random Seed Handling**

    The camera manages random number generation for stochastic processes (e.g.,
    cross-talk, background noise) on a per-pixel basis. The seed for each pixel
    is derived from a single ``uint64`` master seed, :py:attr:`base_seed`, to
    ensure reproducibility. This behavior is controlled by the following
    attributes:

    - :py:attr:`base_seed`: The master seed that can be set by the user for
      reproducibility. When this value is changed, the per-pixel seeds in
      :py:attr:`seed` are automatically updated.
    - :py:attr:`random_seed`: If ``True`` (default), a new random value for
      :py:attr:`base_seed` is generated at each :py:meth:`restart()` call.
      This ensures that different simulation runs are independent. When set to ``False``,
      :py:attr:`base_seed` is reset to 0.
    - :py:attr:`increment_seed`: If ``True`` (default), the :py:attr:`base_seed`
      is incremented by `n_pixels` after each :py:meth:`simulate_response()`
      call. This provides different random sequences for consecutive events
      within the same run.
    - :py:attr:`seed`: A CuPy array containing a unique seed for each pixel,
      derived from :py:attr:`base_seed`. This array is passed to the CUDA
      kernels.

    def simulate_response(self, source=None):
        """Simulates the camera response to a given source of photo-electrons.

        This method controls the simulation process:

          1. Getting the source.
          2. Preparing time windows for trigger channels.
          3. Triggering actions (pre, trigger, post).
          4. Preparing time windows for channels to be sampled.
          5. Sampling actions (pre, sampling, post).

        If :py:attr:`enable_camera_trigger` is True, the :py:meth:`pre_trigger_action`,
        :py:meth:`trigger_action`, and :py:meth:`post_trigger_action` methods are called in
        sequence.
        If a trigger occurs (as determined by :py:meth:`trigger_action`),
        or if camera triggering is disabled, the sampling phase starts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : Tuple[cp.ndarray, cp.ndarray], optional
            A tuple containing:

              - **pes**: A 1D CuPy array of shape (total_n_pes,) containing the
                arrival times of all photo-electrons.

              - **pes_map**: A 1D CuPy array of shape (n_pixels + 1,) representing
                a mapping to access the arrival times for each pixel.  The arrival
                times for pixel `i` are given by `pes[pes_map[i]:pes_map[i+1]]`.
            
            If None only the background is simulated.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            If camera triggering is disabled (:py:attr:`enable_camera_trigger` is False)
            and :py:attr:`trigger_time` is not set (i.e., is None). This ensures that
            a valid trigger time is available for the sampling phase.

        Notes
        -----
        The method also increments an event counter (`self._event_counter`)
        after each simulation.

        If :py:attr:`increment_seed` is true, the random seed (:py:attr:`seed`) is
        incremented by :py:attr:`n_pixels` after each simulation. This helps
        ensure that the simulation of different events produces different random
        values (e.g. background and cross-talk generation).

        The following methods are called during the simulation:

            1. If camera triggering is enabled:

                a. :py:meth:`pre_trigger_action()`: Actions before the trigger.
                b. :py:meth:`trigger_action()`: Performs the trigger logic (should set :py:attr:`triggered` and :py:attr:`trigger_time` attributes).
                c. :py:meth:`post_trigger_action()`: Actions after the trigger.
            
            2. If :py:attr:`triggered` is True or camera triggering is disabled (and a custom
               trigger time is provided):

                a. :py:meth:`pre_sampling_action()`: Actions before sampling.
                b. :py:meth:`sampling_action()`: Performs the sampling.
                c. :py:meth:`post_sampling_action()`: Actions after sampling.
