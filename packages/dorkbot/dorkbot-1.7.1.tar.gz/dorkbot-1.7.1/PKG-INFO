dorkbot
=======

Scan Google (or other) search results for vulnerabilities.

dorkbot is a modular command-line tool for performing vulnerability scans against sets of webpages returned by Google search queries or other supported sources. It is broken up into two sets of modules:

* *Indexers* - modules that return a list of targets
* *Scanners* - modules that perform a vulnerability scan against each target

Targets are stored in a database as they are indexed. Once scanned, a standard JSON report is produced containing any vulnerabilities found. Indexing and scanning processes can be run separately or combined in a single command (up to one of each).

Quickstart
==========
* Create a Google API credential via the [Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
* Create a Google [Custom Search Engine](https://www.google.com/cse/) and note the search engine ID, e.g. 012345678901234567891:abc12defg3h
<pre>$ pip3 install dorkbot wapiti3</pre>
<pre>$ dorkbot -i google_api -o key=your_api_credential_here -o engine=your_engine_id_here -o query="filetype:php inurl:id"</pre>
<pre>$ dorkbot -s wapiti</pre>

</pre>

Tools / Dependencies
=====
Database drivers:
* [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org) (pip install "psycopg[binary]") (preferred)
* [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/) (pip install psycopg2-binary)

Scanners:
* [Wapiti](http://wapiti.sourceforge.net/) (pip install wapiti3)
* [Codename SCNR](https://github.com/scnr/installer)
* [Arachni](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni) (deprecated)

As needed, dorkbot will search for tools in the following order:
* Directory specified via relevant module option
* Located in *tools* directory (within current directory, by default), with the subdirectory named after the tool
* Available in the user's PATH (e.g. installed system-wide)

Files
=====
All SQLite databases, tools, and reports are saved in the dorkbot directory, which by default is the current directory. You can force a specific directory with the --directory flag. Default file paths within this directory are as follows:

* SQLite database file: *dorkbot.db*
* External tools directory: *tools/*
* Scan report output directory: *reports/*

Configuration files are by default read from *~/.config/dorkbot/* (Linux / MacOS) or in the Application Data folder (Windows), honoring $XDG_CONFIG_HOME / %APPDATA%. Default file paths within this directory are as follows:

* Dorkbot configuration file: *dorkbot.ini*

Config File
===========
The configuration file (dorkbot.ini) can be used to prepopulate certain command-line flags.

Example dorkbot.ini:
<pre>
[dorkbot]
database=/opt/dorkbot/dorkbot.db
[dorkbot.indexers.wayback]
domain=example.com
[dorkbot.scanners.arachni]
path=/opt/arachni/bin
report_dir=/tmp/reports
</pre>

Database
========
The target database stores urls to be scanned and the sources where they came from. It tracks each url's scanned status by building a list of fingerprints for each unique page + parameter set and comparing new targets to existing fingerprints. Fingerprints only need to be generated once and will be generated on demand as needed. Fingerprints and scanned status may be reset independently.

Supported database addresses:
* postgresql://[connection_string]
* sqlite3:///path/to/sqlite_file.db
* /path/to/sqlite_file.db
* :memory:

Note that for SQLite target databases the protocol is optional (it is still required for external blocklists). Additionally, SQLite's in-memory feature can be used to avoid writing to disk entirely by specifying a database address of ":memory:".

Blocklist
=========
The blocklist is a list of ip addresses, hostnames, or regular expressions of url patterns that should *not* be scanned. If a target url matches any item in this list it will be skipped and removed from the database. The internal blocklist is maintained in the dorkbot database, but a separate file or database can be specified by passing the appropriate file path or connection uri to --external-blocklist. Targets are matched first against the internal blocklist and then optionally against any provided external blocklists.

Supported external blocklists:
* postgresql://[connection_string]
* sqlite3:///path/to/blocklist.db
* /path/to/blocklist.txt

Example blocklist items:
<pre>
regex:^[^\?]+$
regex:.*login.*
regex:^https?://[^.]*.example.com/.*
host:www.google.com
ip:127.0.0.1
</pre>

The first item will remove any target that doesn't contain a question mark, in other words any url that doesn't contain any GET parameters to test. The second attempts to avoid login functions, and the third blocklists all target urls on example.com. The fourth excludes targets with a hostname of www.google.com and the fifth excludes targets whose host resolves to 127.0.0.1.

Prune
=====
The prune flag iterates through all targets, computes the fingerprints, and marks subsequent matching targets as scanned. It also marks blocklist matches as scanned. The result is a database where --list-targets --unscanned-only returns only scannable urls. It honors the **random** flag to process fingerprints in random order and the **unscanned-only** flag to skip scanned targets which necessarily already have fingerprints. The blocklist check honors --delete-on-match to delete the target rather than marking it scanned, and --delete-on-error to delete any entry that fails to parse a valid hostname or resolve the hostname to ip address.

General Options
===============
These options are applicable regardless of module chosen:
<pre>
  --source [SOURCE]     Label associated with targets
  --count COUNT         number of urls to retrieve/scan, or -1 for all
  --random              retrieve urls in random order
</pre>

Additionally, blocklist-related options --delete-on-match / --delete-on-error will cause matching or erroneous targets to be skipped.
