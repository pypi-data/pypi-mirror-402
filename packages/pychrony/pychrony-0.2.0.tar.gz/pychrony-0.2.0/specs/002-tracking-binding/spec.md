# Feature Specification: Chrony Time Synchronization Monitoring Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-tracking-binding`  
**Created**: 2025-06-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enable Python applications to monitor chrony time synchronization status and access core synchronization metrics for system time accuracy assessment."

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-01-15

- Q: What are the Python data types for tracking fields (offset, frequency, reference_id, stratum)? → A: Based on libchrony RPY_Tracking structure: offset=float (seconds), frequency=float (ppm), reference_id=int (uint32), stratum=int (0-15)
- Q: Should spec use chrony-specific or generic "time service" terminology? → A: Use chrony-specific terms (chronyd, libchrony, chrony tracking data) throughout
- Q: Should pychrony add observability/logging? → A: No logging in pychrony; rely on exception messages for diagnostics (keep binding thin)
- Q: Session lifecycle for high-level API (open_socket → init_session → request → get_fields → deinit)? → A: New session per call; open/close each get_tracking() invocation (stateless, simple, avoids stale connections)
- Q: Field access pattern (chrony_get_field_index then chrony_get_field_float)? → A: Lookup per request; fresh field index lookup each call (no caching, keeps implementation simple)
- Q: Error handling when chrony_get_field_index returns -1 (field not found)? → A: Raise ChronyDataError; fail fast on missing expected fields (indicates protocol/version mismatch)

### Session 2025-06-17

- Q: What data structure should the Python binding return for the synchronization report? → A: Return structured data (dataclass/dict) with fields: offset, frequency, reference_id, stratum, etc.
- Q: What error handling strategy should the interface use for edge cases and failures? → A: Raise specific Python exceptions with clear error messages and error codes for different failure scenarios

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Monitor Chrony Tracking Status (Priority: P1)

Application developers need to access chrony tracking information to ensure their applications can make informed decisions about time-sensitive operations and validate system clock accuracy.

**Why this priority**: This provides essential visibility into chronyd synchronization status, which is critical for applications that depend on accurate timing for logging, transactions, or coordination.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by retrieving chrony tracking data from a running chronyd instance and verifying the returned data contains expected synchronization metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system with chronyd running, **When** an application requests tracking status via libchrony, **Then** the system returns structured data with fields: offset, frequency, reference_id, stratum, and accuracy metrics
2. **Given** chronyd is not running or unreachable, **When** an application requests tracking status, **Then** the system raises a specific exception with clear error message about chronyd availability
3. **Given** libchrony is installed, **When** the pychrony interface is accessed, **Then** all chrony tracking functions are available

---

### User Story 2 - Verify libchrony Integration (Priority: P2)

System administrators and DevOps teams need to verify that pychrony works correctly across different system configurations and deployment environments.

**Why this priority**: Ensures reliable operation in production environments and prevents integration issues during deployment and maintenance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by validating libchrony availability and dependency status without requiring active chronyd instance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** libchrony is installed, **When** pychrony is initialized, **Then** all chrony tracking functions are accessible
2. **Given** libchrony is not installed, **When** pychrony is initialized, **Then** clear error messages indicate libchrony needs to be installed
3. **Given** proper system permissions, **When** chrony tracking functions are called, **Then** data is handled safely and correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Demonstrate Usage Patterns (Priority: P3) ⏸️ DEFERRED

> **Status**: Deferred - quickstart.md provides inline examples; standalone examples/ directory deferred to future release.

Developers evaluating pychrony need working examples to understand how to integrate chrony tracking monitoring into their applications.

**Why this priority**: Reduces learning curve and accelerates adoption by providing practical, copy-paste ready usage examples.

**Current Coverage**: quickstart.md contains basic usage, error handling, monitoring, and health check examples inline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running example scripts and verifying they display meaningful chrony tracking data when chronyd is available.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** chronyd is running, **When** the example code executes, **Then** it displays structured chrony tracking data with accessible field names
2. **Given** chronyd is unavailable, **When** the example code executes, **Then** it provides helpful guidance about chronyd availability

---

### Edge Cases

- libchrony returns incomplete tracking data → Raise specific exception with details about missing fields
- Permission errors when accessing chronyd → Raise PermissionError with clear message about required access rights
- libchrony version is incompatible with pychrony → Raise VersionError with compatibility information
- Invalid or corrupted data from libchrony → Raise DataError with details about validation failures

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: pychrony MUST provide a method to retrieve chrony tracking status information
- **FR-002**: pychrony MUST interface with libchrony to access chronyd tracking data
- **FR-003**: pychrony MUST return chrony tracking data as structured data (dataclass/dict) with specific fields: offset, frequency, reference_id, stratum, and accuracy metrics
- **FR-004**: pychrony MUST handle chronyd unavailability by raising specific Python exceptions with clear error messages and error codes
- **FR-005**: pychrony MUST validate data types and reasonable ranges for all returned chrony tracking fields
- **FR-006**: pychrony MUST provide clear documentation about libchrony dependency requirements
- **FR-007**: pychrony MUST include example code demonstrating basic usage patterns (satisfied by quickstart.md)
- **FR-008**: pychrony MUST support Linux as the primary deployment platform
- **FR-009**: pychrony MUST maintain compatibility across supported Python versions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Chrony Tracking Report**: Structured data (dataclass/dict) mirroring libchrony RPY_Tracking structure with fields: offset: float (seconds, time difference from reference), frequency: float (ppm, clock correction rate), reference_id: int (uint32, time source identifier), stratum: int (0-15, NTP hierarchy level), plus additional accuracy metrics from libchrony
- **libchrony Connection**: Represents the CFFI binding to libchrony for accessing chronyd data
- **Error Information**: Python exception objects containing error codes, descriptive messages, and diagnostic details for troubleshooting chronyd/libchrony failures

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can retrieve chrony tracking status in under 10ms when chronyd is running (local Unix socket call)
- **SC-002**: pychrony successfully initializes on Fedora 39+, RHEL/CentOS 9+, and Ubuntu 22.04+ with libchrony installed
- **SC-003**: Comprehensive test coverage validates all pychrony functionality
- **SC-004**: Example code runs successfully on first attempt for users with chronyd and libchrony installed
- **SC-005**: Error handling provides clear guidance for all documented chronyd/libchrony failure scenarios
