# Tasks: Multiple Reports Bindings

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-multiple-reports-bindings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a library requiring contract and integration test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: No new setup required - this feature extends existing pychrony infrastructure

This feature builds on the existing pychrony project structure:
- CFFI bindings infrastructure exists in `src/pychrony/_core/_bindings.py`
- Data models pattern exists in `src/pychrony/models.py`
- Exception hierarchy exists in `src/pychrony/exceptions.py`
- Test structure exists in `tests/unit/`, `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`

**Checkpoint**: Setup phase is already complete from initial project setup

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Shared Validation Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create reusable validation functions that all three new report types will use

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Validation infrastructure must be complete before any user story implementation

- [X] T001 Add validation helper `_validate_finite_float()` in src/pychrony/_core/_bindings.py
- [X] T002 Add validation helper `_validate_bounded_int()` in src/pychrony/_core/_bindings.py
- [X] T003 Add validation helper `_validate_non_negative_int()` in src/pychrony/_core/_bindings.py

**Checkpoint**: Validation infrastructure ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Already complete from initial project
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: No dependencies - can start immediately, BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2), independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2), independent of US1 and US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 (validates consistency across all)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 completion (validates consistency)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Dataclass before helper methods
- Helper methods before validation function
- Validation function before record extraction helper
- Record extraction helper before main function
- Main function before exports
- Exports before story completion

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Foundational tasks (T001-T003) work on the same file - execute sequentially
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- User Stories 1, 2, 3 can proceed in parallel after Foundational phase (if team capacity allows)
- User Story 4 must wait for US1, US2, US3 to validate consistency

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for Source dataclass in tests/contract/test_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for get_sources() signature in tests/contract/test_api.py"
Task: "Unit test for Source dataclass creation in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for Source.is_reachable() method in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for Source.is_selected() method in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for Source.mode_name property in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for Source.state_name property in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for _validate_source() function in tests/unit/test_validation.py"
Task: "Integration test for get_sources() in tests/integration/test_sources.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (validation helpers)
2. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (get_sources)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test get_sources() independently
4. Can ship MVP with just get_sources() if needed

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Foundational → Validation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (get_sources) → Test independently → Usable MVP
3. Add User Story 2 (get_source_stats) → Test independently → Enhanced monitoring
4. Add User Story 3 (get_rtc_data) → Test independently → Complete report coverage
5. Add User Story 4 (consistency check) → Validate all follow patterns
6. Polish → Ship complete feature

### Sequential Execution (Recommended)

Since this is a single-developer effort building on existing patterns:

1. Phase 2: Foundational (T001-T003)
2. Phase 3: User Story 1 - MVP (T004-T022)
3. Phase 4: User Story 2 (T023-T035)
4. Phase 5: User Story 3 (T036-T049)
5. Phase 6: User Story 4 (T050-T056)
6. Phase 7: Polish (T057-T063)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story delivers independent value (US1 alone is a valid MVP)
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All field mappings verified against libchrony source (client.c)
