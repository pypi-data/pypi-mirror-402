      "submission": "The Industrial Revolution, spanning roughly 1760-1840, originated in Britain due to several\n    key factors. First, Britain possessed abundant natural resources, particularly coal and iron ore,\n    which powered factories and machinery. Second, agricultural improvements like crop rotation and\n    the enclosure movement freed rural workers to migrate to cities. Third, a stable political system\n    and strong property rights encouraged investment in new technologies.\n\n    The effects were profound and far-reaching. Economically, factory production replaced cottage\n    industries, dramatically increasing output and creating new wealth. Socially, urbanization\n    accelerated as workers flocked to industrial centers, leading to overcrowded cities with poor\n    sanitation. Working conditions in early factories were harsh, with long hours, low wages, and\n    child labor common. Environmentally, coal burning polluted air and waterways.\n\n    Long-term consequences included the rise of the middle class, labor movements demanding workers'\n    rights, and technological innovations that continue shaping our world today.",

      "submission": "The Industrial Revolution happened because Britain had lots of coal and iron. Factories\n    started using machines instead of hand tools. James Watt improved the steam engine which\n    helped power many factories.\n\n    Effects included people moving from farms to cities. Factory work was hard and dangerous.\n    Children often worked in mines and mills. Cities became crowded and dirty. But there were\n    also positive effects - more goods were produced cheaper, and eventually living standards\n    improved. The middle class grew as factory owners and merchants became wealthy.",

The cotton gin, invented by Eli Whitney, also boosted cotton production\n    (though this was in America, not Britain).\n\n    Effects included urbanization, class struggle between workers and owners, environmental\n    degradation, and eventually improved living standards.

Goods that once took weeks to produce by hand could\n    be made in hours by machine. This lowered prices, made products accessible to more people,\n    and generated enormous wealth - though distributed unequally.\n\n    Social effects: The traditional social order was disrupted. Landed aristocracy gradually\n    ceded power to industrial capitalists. A new working class emerged, often living in squalid\n    conditions. Child labor was rampant until reform movements succeeded in passing protective\n    legislation.\n\n    Environmental effects: Deforestation, air pollution from coal burning, and water\n    contamination became serious problems. Rivers like the Thames became essentially open sewers.\n\n    Political effects: Workers organized into unions and demanded rights. The Chartist movement\n    pushed for democratic reforms.
