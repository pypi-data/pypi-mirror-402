              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

## Features

- **Browse S3 buckets and objects** with an intuitive file manager interface
- **Navigate folder structures** seamlessly
- **Upload files and directories** to S3
- **Download files and directories** from S3
- **Copy and move files and folders** within the same bucket or across different S3 buckets
- **Delete objects and folders** with confirmation prompts
- **Rename files and folders** with conflict detection
- **Filter and search** through buckets
- **Sort objects** by name, type, modification date, or size
- **Lazy loading with pagination** - buckets and objects load progressively as you scroll

- **Flexible configuration** via CLI arguments or config files
- **Multiple authentication methods** (AWS profiles, CLI access keys)
- **S3-compatible services** support (LocalStack, MinIO, etc.)

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install s3ranger
```

### Using uv

```bash
# Install s3ranger globally
uv tool install s3ranger@latest

# Update to latest version
uv tool upgrade s3ranger
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sharashchandra/s3ranger.git
cd s3ranger
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure AWS Credentials

The recommended way to configure AWS credentials is using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

This sets up your default profile in `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`.

### 2. Launch s3ranger

```bash
s3ranger
```

That's it! s3ranger will use your default AWS profile automatically.

### Using Multiple AWS Profiles

If you work with multiple AWS accounts, you can set up named profiles and switch between them easily.

#### Setting up profiles with AWS CLI

```bash
# Configure your default profile
aws configure

# Configure additional named profiles
aws configure --profile work
aws configure --profile personal
```

#### AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[work]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY

[personal]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE2
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLE2
```

#### AWS config file (`~/.aws/config`)

```ini
[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json

[profile work]
region = us-west-2
output = json

[profile personal]
region = eu-west-1
output = json
# Optional: for S3-compatible services
# endpoint_url = https://s3.custom-endpoint.com
```

#### Using profiles with s3ranger

```bash
# Use a specific profile via CLI
s3ranger --profile-name work

# Or set a default profile in s3ranger config file (~/.s3ranger.config)
# profile_name = "work"
```

### One-off Usage with Direct Credentials

For quick, one-time access, you can pass credentials directly via CLI:

```bash
s3ranger --aws-access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
         --aws-secret-access-key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

For temporary credentials (e.g., from AWS STS), include the session token:

```bash
s3ranger --aws-access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
         --aws-secret-access-key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY \
         --aws-session-token your-session-token
```

> **Note:** Direct credentials via CLI are useful for one-off usage but not recommended for regular use. Use AWS profiles for better security and convenience.

## Credential Priority

s3ranger resolves credentials in the following order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **CLI credentials** (`--aws-access-key-id` + `--aws-secret-access-key`)
2. **CLI profile** (`--profile-name`)
3. **Config file profile** (`profile_name` in `~/.s3ranger.config`)
4. **boto3 default resolution** - If none of the above are provided, s3ranger lets boto3 resolve credentials using its [standard credential chain](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html), which includes environment variables, AWS config files, IAM roles, etc.

CLI arguments always override config file settings.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Launch the TUI
s3ranger

# Launch with specific AWS profile
s3ranger --profile-name myprofile

# Launch with custom endpoint (for S3-compatible services)
s3ranger --endpoint-url https://s3.amazonaws.com --region-name us-west-2

# Launch with specific theme
s3ranger --theme dracula

# Show help
s3ranger --help

# Interactive configuration
s3ranger configure
```

### Working with S3-Compatible Services

s3ranger works with any S3-compatible service. You can configure these services either via CLI arguments or through AWS config files.

#### LocalStack

LocalStack is a fully functional local AWS cloud stack for testing and development.

**Quick start (CLI):**

```bash
s3ranger --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region-name us-east-1
```

**Using AWS config files:**

Add a LocalStack profile to your `~/.aws/credentials`:

```ini
[localstack]
aws_access_key_id = test
aws_secret_access_key = test
```

Add the endpoint configuration to your `~/.aws/config`:

```ini
[profile localstack]
region = us-east-1
output = json
endpoint_url = http://localhost:4566
```

Then launch s3ranger with the profile:

```bash
s3ranger --profile-name localstack
```

---

#### MinIO

MinIO is a high-performance object storage server compatible with Amazon S3.

> **Note:** For MinIO, the `--aws-access-key-id` corresponds to your MinIO **username** and `--aws-secret-access-key` corresponds to your MinIO **password**. The default credentials for MinIO are `minioadmin` / `minioadmin`.

**Quick start (CLI):**

```bash
s3ranger --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 --region-name us-east-1 \
         --aws-access-key-id minioadmin \
         --aws-secret-access-key minioadmin
```

**Using AWS config files:**

Add a MinIO profile to your `~/.aws/credentials`:

```ini
[minio]
aws_access_key_id = minioadmin
aws_secret_access_key = minioadmin
```

Add the endpoint configuration to your `~/.aws/config`:

```ini
[profile minio]
region = us-east-1
output = json
endpoint_url = http://localhost:9000
```

Then launch s3ranger with the profile:

```bash
s3ranger --profile-name minio
```

Or set it as default in your s3ranger config (`~/.s3ranger.config`):

```toml
profile_name = "minio"
```

## Configuration

### Configuration File

s3ranger can be configured using a TOML configuration file located at `~/.s3ranger.config`:

```toml
# AWS Configuration
profile_name = "default"

# UI Configuration
theme = "Github Dark"

# Download Configuration
# Default directory for downloads (defaults to ~/Downloads/)
download_directory = "~/Documents/"

# Performance
# Set to false to load all items at once instead of using pagination
enable_pagination = true
```

**Supported config file options:**

- `profile_name` - AWS profile to use (can be overridden with `--profile-name`)
- `theme` - UI theme (Github Dark, Dracula, Solarized, Sepia)
- `download_directory` - Default directory for downloads (defaults to `~/Downloads/`)
- `enable_pagination` - Enable or disable pagination

> **Tip:** Set `download_directory = "."` in your config file to always use the current working directory as the default download location. This is useful when you want downloads to go to your project directory.

> **Note:** AWS credentials (`aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, `aws_session_token`) are only supported via CLI arguments.

### Interactive Configuration

Run the configuration wizard to set up your config file:

```bash
s3ranger configure
```

## Pagination

s3ranger uses lazy loading with pagination to handle large numbers of buckets and objects efficiently:

- **Bucket list**: Loads 250 buckets at a time
- **Object list**: Loads 25 objects at a time

As you scroll down using the mouse or arrow keys, more items are automatically loaded. This ensures fast initial load times even when you have hundreds of buckets or thousands of objects.

## Themes

s3ranger comes with several built-in themes:

- **GitHub Dark** (default) - Dark theme inspired by GitHub's interface
- **Dracula** - Popular dark theme with purple accents
- **Solarized** - The classic Solarized color scheme
- **Sepia** - Warm, vintage-inspired theme

Change themes using:

```bash
s3ranger --theme dracula
```

Or through the configuration file:

```toml
theme = "Dracula"
```
