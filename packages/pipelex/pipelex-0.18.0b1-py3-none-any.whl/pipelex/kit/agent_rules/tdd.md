# Test-Driven Development Guide

This document outlines our test-driven development (TDD) process and the tools available for testing.

## TDD Cycle

1. **Write a Test First**

2. **Write the Code**
   - Implement the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test
   - Follow the project's coding standards
   - Keep it simple - don't write more than needed

3. **Run Linting and Type Checking**

4. **Validate tests**

Remember: The key to TDD is writing the test first and letting it drive your implementation. Then, always run the full test suite and quality checks before considering a feature complete.
