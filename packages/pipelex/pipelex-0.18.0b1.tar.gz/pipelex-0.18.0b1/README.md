![Pipelex Tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pipelex/pipelex/dev/.github/assets/pipelex-tutorial-v2.gif)


# 🚀 Quick start

## 1. Install Pipelex

```bash
pip install pipelex
pipelex init
```

## 2. Configure AI Access

To run pipelines with AI models, choose one of these options:

### Option A: Pipelex Gateway (Recommended)

Get **free credits** with a single API key for LLMs, document extraction, and image generation across all major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, and more). New models added constantly.

1. Get your API key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/)
2. Add it to your `.env` file: `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-key-here`
3. Run `pipelex init` and accept the Gateway terms of service

> **Migrating from pipelex_inference?** The old `pipelex_inference` backend is deprecated. Get your new Gateway key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/).

### Option B: Bring Your Own Keys

Use your existing API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc. See [Configure AI Providers](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/configure-ai-providers/) for setup.

### Option C: Local AI

Run models locally with Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, or llama.cpp - no API keys required. See [Configure AI Providers](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/configure-ai-providers/) for details.

## 3. Generate Your First Workflow

Create a complete AI workflow with a single command:

```bash
pipelex build pipe "Take a CV and Job offer in PDF, analyze if they match and generate 5 questions for the interview" --output results/cv_match.plx
```

This command generates a production-ready `.plx` file with domain definitions, concepts, and multiple processing steps that analyzes CV-job fit and prepares interview questions.

**cv_match.plx**
```toml
domain = "cv_match"
description = "Matching CVs with job offers and generating interview questions"
main_pipe = "analyze_cv_job_match_and_generate_questions"

[concept.MatchAnalysis]

```
## 4. Run Your Pipeline

**Via CLI:**

```bash
# Run with input file
pipelex run results/cv_match.plx --inputs inputs.json
```

Create an `inputs.json` file with your PDF URLs:

```json
{
  "cv_pdf": {
    "concept": "PDF",
    "content": {
      "url": "https://pipelex-web.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/John-Doe-CV.pdf"
    }
  },
  "job_offer_pdf": {
    "concept": "PDF",
    "content": {
      "url": "https://pipelex-web.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/Job-Offer.pdf"
    }
  }
}
```

**Via Python:**

```python
import asyncio
import json
from pipelex.pipeline.execute import execute_pipeline
from pipelex.pipelex import Pipelex

async def run_pipeline():
    with open("inputs.json", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        inputs = json.load(f)

    pipe_output = await execute_pipeline(
        pipe_code="cv_match",
        inputs=inputs
    )
    print(pipe_output.main_stuff_as_str)

Pipelex.make()
asyncio.run(run_pipeline())
```

## 5. Iterate with AI Assistance

Install AI assistant rules to easily modify your pipelines:

```bash
pipelex kit rules
```

This installs rules for Cursor, Claude, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Blackbox AI. Now you can refine pipelines with natural language:

- "Include confidence scores between 0 and 100 in the match analysis"
- "Write a recap email at the end"

## 💡 What is Pipelex?

Pipelex is an open-source language that enables you to build and run **repeatable AI workflows**. Instead of cramming everything into one complex prompt, you break tasks into focused steps, each pipe handling one clear transformation.

Each pipe processes information using **Concepts** (typing with meaning) to ensure your pipelines make sense. The Pipelex language (`.plx` files) is simple and human-readable, even for non-technical users. Each step can be structured and validated, giving you the reliability of software with the intelligence of AI.

- [Configure AI Providers](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/configure-ai-providers/) - Set up AI providers and models

## 🔧 IDE Extension

We **highly** recommend installing our extension for `.plx` files into your IDE. You can find it in the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Pipelex/pipelex). It's coming soon to VS Code marketplace too. If you're using Cursor, Windsurf or another VS Code fork, you can search for it directly in your extensions tab.

Clone it, fork it, and experiment with production-ready pipelines for various use cases.

## 🎯 Optional Features

The package supports the following additional features:

- `anthropic`: Anthropic/Claude support for text generation
- `google`: Google models (Vertex) support for text generation
- `mistralai`: Mistral AI support for text generation and OCR
- `bedrock`: Amazon Bedrock support for text generation
- `fal`: Image generation with Black Forest Labs "FAL" service

Install all extras:

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install "pipelex[anthropic,google,google-genai,mistralai,bedrock,fal]"
```

## Privacy & Telemetry

Pipelex supports two independent telemetry streams:

- **Gateway Telemetry**: When using Pipelex Gateway, telemetry must be enabled (tied to your hashed API key) to monitor service quality and enforce fair usage. [Learn more](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/telemetry/#gateway-telemetry-pipelex-controlled)
- **Custom Telemetry**: User-controlled via `.pipelex/telemetry.toml` for your own observability systems (Langfuse, PostHog, OTLP). [Learn more](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/telemetry/#custom-telemetry-user-controlled)

**We only collect technical data** (model names, token counts, latency, error rates) - never your prompts, completions, or business data. Set `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` to disable all telemetry (note: Gateway requires telemetry to function).

For more details, see the [Telemetry Documentation](https://docs.pipelex.com/home/5-setup/telemetry/) or read our [Privacy Policy](https://go.pipelex.com/privacy-policy).
