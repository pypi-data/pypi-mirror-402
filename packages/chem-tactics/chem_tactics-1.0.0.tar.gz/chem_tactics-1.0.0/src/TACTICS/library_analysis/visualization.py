class TS_Benchmarks:

    A class to generate visualizations of TS results. The goal here is to compare different cycles of TS runs with the same search strategy.
    This is mainly used to compare different search strategies to ground truth values.
    Each search strategy is used a no of times equal to the number of cycles.
    It is recommended that random baseline data and brute-force (exhaustive search) data be included for comparison.
    Reference data is optional, but is required for generating the barplots. A strip plot can be generated without reference data for comparison of methods.
    
    All required data (TS runs data, bar plot data, line plot data, and grouped statistics) is automatically generated during initialization.
    After creating an instance, you can directly call the plotting methods without additional data generation steps.
