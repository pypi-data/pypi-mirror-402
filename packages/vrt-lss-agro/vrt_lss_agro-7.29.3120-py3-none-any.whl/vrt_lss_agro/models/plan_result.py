    Veeroute Agro API.  # Description  The service is designed to calculate the work plan of production facilities.  ## Objects overview  ![objects](../images/agro_objects.svg)  ### Field  - produces a certain crop of a certain moisture content - products from the field can only be moved to the Elevator or Factory  ### Elevator  - consists of Gates, Dryers, short-term and long-term storage areas - dries the grain (if the moisture content of the crop is more than acceptable) - stores dry grain in short-term storage places (warehouses), while unloading and loading grain is allowed within one day - stores dry grain in long-term storage places (sleeves, trenches, mounds) - when stored in one storage, only one type of culture can be located - sells surplus grain to the Market - production processes inside the facility: drying, loading / unloading to a storage location, storage  ### Factory  - consists of Gates, Dryers, Bunkers, Consumers - [if drying is present] dries the grain (if the moisture content of the crop is more than allowed) - stores dry grain in Bunkers (short-term storage tied to a specific crop) - maintains a minimum supply of grain for consumption in the Bunkers - Consumes grain from Bunkers - buys the missing grain from the Market - production processes inside the facility: drying, loading / unloading to a storage location, storage, consumption  ### Market  - buys grain from elevators - sells grain to factories  ## Project  The project reflects the planned sequence of operations on agricultural crops, the types of operations are described below.  ### HARVEST  Crop harvesting:  - between production facilities (Field and Elevator or Field) - the operation takes place within one day - on the Field there is a determination of grain moisture  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key) | |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------| | Source      | Field               | -                             | | Destination | Elevator or Factory | Gate                          |  ### DRY  Drying culture:  - inside the production facility (Elevator or Field) - duration of the operation - days - during the drying process, the mass and type of humidity changes (WET -> DRY) - the source indicates the mass of raw culture - in the appointment, the resulting mass of dry culture is indicated  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key) | |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator or Factory | Gate                          | | Destination | Elevator or Factory | Dryer                         |  ### LOAD  Loading culture from the Gate to the Storage Location (long-term, short-term, silo):  - between parts of one production facility (Elevator or Field) - the operation takes place within one day  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key)                    | |-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator or Factory | Gate or Dryer                                    | | Destination | Elevator or Factory | Storage location (long-term, short-term, bunker) |  ### UNLOAD  Unloading the culture from the storage place to the gate:  - between parts of one production facility (Elevator) - the operation takes place within one day  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key)                    | |-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator            | Storage location (long-term, short-term, bunker) | | Destination | Elevator            | Gate                                             |  ### STORE  Culture storage:  - the operation takes place within one day - storage location does not change  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key)                    | |-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator or Factory | Storage location (long-term, short-term, bunker) | | Destination | Elevator or Factory | The same storage location                        |  ### RELOCATE  Transportation between production facilities:  - between production facilities (Elevator and Field) - the operation takes place within one day  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key) | |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator            | Gate                          | | Destination | Factory             | Gate                          |  ### CONSUMPTION  Field crop consumption:  - between parts of one production facility (Field) - the operation takes place within one day - consumption comes from the Bunker - in addition, we can consume directly from the Gate or Dryer without laying in the Bunker  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key) | |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------| | Source      | Factory             | Hopper or Gate or Dryer       | | Destination | Factory             | Consumer                      |  ### SELL  Sale of culture:  - between production facilities (Elevator and Market) - the operation takes place within one day  |             | Object (target_key) | Subobject (target_detail_key) | |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------| | Source      | Elevator            | Gate                          | | Destination | Market              | Contract                      |  ### BUY  Buying culture:  -
