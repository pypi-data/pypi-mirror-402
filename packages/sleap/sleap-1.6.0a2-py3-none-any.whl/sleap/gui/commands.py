"""
Module for gui command context and commands objects.

Each open project (i.e., `MainWindow`) will have its own `CommandContext`.
The context enables commands to access and modify the `GuiState` and `Labels`,
as well as potentially maintaining a command history (so we can add support for
undo!). See `sleap.gui.app` for how the context is created and used.

Every command will have both a method in `CommandContext` (this is what should
be used to trigger the command, e.g., connected to the menu action) and a
class which inherits from `AppCommand` (or a more specialized class such as
`NavCommand`, `GoIteratorCommand`, or `EditCommand`). Note that this code relies
on inheritance, so some care and attention is required.

A typical command will override the `ask` and `do_action` methods. If the
command updates something which affects the GUI, it should override the `topic`
attribute (this then gets passed back to the `update_callback` from the context.
If a command doesn't require any input from the user, then it doesn't need to
override the `ask` method.

If it's not possible to separate the GUI "ask" and the non-GUI "do" code, then
instead of `ask` and `do_action` you should add an `ask_and_do` method
(for instance, `DeleteDialogCommand` and `MergeProject` show dialogues which
handle both the GUI and the action). Ideally we'd endorse separation of "ask"
and "do" for all commands (this is important if we're going to implement undo)--
for now it's at least easy to see where this separation is violated.
