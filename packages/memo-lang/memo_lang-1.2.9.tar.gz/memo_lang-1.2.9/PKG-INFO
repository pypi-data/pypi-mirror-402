[memo](https://github.com/kach/memo) is a probabilistic programming language for expressing computational cognitive models involving **recursive reasoning about reasoning**. memo inherits from the tradition of WebPPL-based Bayesian modeling (see [probmods](http://probmods.org/), [agentmodels](https://agentmodels.org/), and [problang](https://www.problang.org/)), but aims to make models **easier to write and run** by taking advantage of modern programming language techniques and hardware capabilities (including GPUs!). As a result, models are often significantly simpler to express (we've seen codebases shrink by a **factor of 3x or more**), and dramatically faster to execute and fit to data (we've seen **speedups of 3,000x or more**). In idiomatic memo, a POMDP solver is 15 lines of code, and is just as fast as a hand-optimized solver written in 200 lines of code.

memo stands for: mental modeling, memoized matrix operations, model-expressed-model-optimized, and metacognitive memos.
