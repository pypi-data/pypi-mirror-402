:fire: FLAML supports AutoML and Hyperparameter Tuning in [Microsoft Fabric Data Science](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/automated-machine-learning-fabric). In addition, we've introduced Python 3.11 and 3.12 support, along with a range of new estimators, and comprehensive integration with MLflow—thanks to contributions from the Microsoft Fabric product team.

:fire: Heads-up: [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) has moved to a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). FLAML no longer includes the `autogen` module—please use AutoGen directly.

## What is FLAML

FLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine
learning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.
and optimizes their performance.

- FLAML enables economical automation and tuning for ML/AI workflows, including model selection and hyperparameter optimization under resource constraints.
- For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.
- It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.

FLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.

FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.

## Installation

The latest version of FLAML requires **Python >= 3.10 and < 3.14**. While other Python versions may work for core components, full model support is not guaranteed. FLAML can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install flaml
```

Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`automl`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML) module.

```bash
pip install "flaml[automl]"
```

Find more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).
Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.

## Quickstart

- With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast
  AutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).

```python
from flaml import AutoML

automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification")
```

- You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning
  tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification", estimator_list=["lgbm"])
```

- You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).

```python
from flaml import tune

tune.run(
    evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600
)
```

- [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.

```python
from flaml.default import LGBMRegressor

# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.
estimator = LGBMRegressor()
# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
