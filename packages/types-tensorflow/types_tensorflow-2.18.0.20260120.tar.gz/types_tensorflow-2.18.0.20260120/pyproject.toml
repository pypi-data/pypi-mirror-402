## Typing stubs for tensorflow

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`tensorflow`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `tensorflow`. This version of
`types-tensorflow` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`tensorflow~=2.18.0`.

Partially generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.6.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.6.0) and libprotoc 27.2 on `tensorflow==2.18.0`.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/tensorflow`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/tensorflow)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.19.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.408

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`4992a813c160e037712b0793cd0488275cb3d195`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/4992a813c160e037712b0793cd0488275cb3d195).
