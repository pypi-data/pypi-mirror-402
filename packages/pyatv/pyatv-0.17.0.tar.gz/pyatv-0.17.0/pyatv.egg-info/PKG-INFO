This is an asyncio python library for interacting with Apple TV and AirPlay devices. It mainly
targets Apple TVs (all generations, **including tvOS 15 and later**), but also supports audio streaming via AirPlay
to receivers like the HomePod, AirPort Express and third-party speakers. It can act as remote control to the Music
app/iTunes in macOS.

All the documentation you need is available at **[pyatv.dev](https://pyatv.dev)**.

# What can it do?

Some examples include:

* Remote control commands
* Metadata retrieval with push updates
* Stream files via AirPlay
* List and launch installed apps
* List and switch user accounts
* Add, remove or set audio output devices (e.g. HomePods)
* Keyboard support
* Persistent storage of credentials and settings

...and lots more! A complete list is available [here](https://pyatv.dev/documentation/supported_features/).

# Great, but how do I use it?

All documentation (especially for developers) are available at [pyatv.dev](https://pyatv.dev).
It is however possible to install with `pip` and set up a new device `atvremote`:

```raw
$ pip install pyatv
$ atvremote wizard

Currently playing:

```

After setting up a new device, other commands can be run directly:

```raw
$ atvremote -s 10.0.10.254 playing
  Media type: Music
Device state: Playing
       Title: Never Gonna Give You Up
      Artist: Rick Astley
    Position: 1/213s (0.0%)
      Repeat: Off
     Shuffle: Off
$ atvremote -s 10.0.10.254 pause
$ atvremote -n FakeATV play
```

You can also run it inside a container (x86_64, aarch64, armv7):

```raw
docker run -it --rm --network=host ghcr.io/postlund/pyatv:0.14.0 atvremote scan
```

The `master` tag points to latest commit on the `master` branch and `latest`
points to the latest release.
