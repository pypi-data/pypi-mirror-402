**PDE-Seg (PDE-Segregate)** is a univariate filter feature selection method based on a filter-measure that ranks features according to their ability to segregate the probability density estimates (PDE) of the class samples.

## Install
PDE-Seg can be installed from PyPI:
<pre>
pip install pdeseg
</pre>

## Example
```python
from pdeseg import PDE_Segregate

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create random classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=300, n_features=50, n_classes=3, n_informative=5,
    shuffle=False
)

# Initialize PDE-Segregate object
pdeRanker = PDE_Segregate()

# Carry out feature selection
pdeRanker.fit(X, y)

# Get top 10 features
top10Features = pdeRanker.get_topnFeatures(10)

# Visualize the top feature's ability to segregate PDEs
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True)

# Top ranked feature
pdeRanker.plot_overlapAreas(top10Features[0], legend="intersection", _ax=axs[0])
axs[0].set_title("Most relevant feature", loc="left")

# Last ranked feature
pdeRanker.plot_overlapAreas(49, legend="intersection", _ax=axs[1])
axs[1].set_title("Least relevant feature", loc="left")

axs[0].set_ylabel(r"Probability Density, $\hat{P}$")
for i in range(2):
    axs[i].set_xlim(-0.5, 1.5)
    axs[i].set_xticks(np.arange(-0.5, 2.0, 0.5))
```
