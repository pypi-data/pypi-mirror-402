# TOPSIS Implementation

## Overview
This Python package provides a clear and practical implementation of the
**TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)**
method for **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)**.

The package ranks multiple alternatives based on numerical criteria using
user-defined **weights** and **impacts (benefit or cost)**.
It is implemented as a **command-line tool** and works directly with CSV files.
