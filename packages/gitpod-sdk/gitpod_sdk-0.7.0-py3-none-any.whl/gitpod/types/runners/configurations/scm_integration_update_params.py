    oauth_client_id can be set to update the OAuth app's client ID. If an empty

    client secret is set), and any existing Host Authentication Tokens for the SCM
    integration's runner and host that were created using the OAuth app will be

    pat can be set to enable or disable Personal Access Tokens support. When
    disabling PATs, any existing Host Authentication Tokens for the SCM
