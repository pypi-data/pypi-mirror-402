# Test: octal_values rule (implicit octals can cause confusion)
# Expected violations: 3 (YAML 1.2 doesn't support implicit octals, but 1.1 did)

name: fast-yaml
version: 0.2.0

permissions:
  file_mode: 0644  # violation: looks like octal but is decimal in YAML 1.2
  dir_mode: 0755   # violation: potentially confusing octal-like value

server:
  port: 8080
  timeout: 030  # violation: leading zero suggests octal intent

config:
  retry_count: 0  # OK: single zero is fine
  max_attempts: 10  # OK: no leading zero
