# CA cdk8s Constructs

This repository contains a collection of opinionated cdk8s constructs that are commonly used in CA applications.

## Installation

The project is available on PyPi under [ca-cdk8s-constructs](https://pypi.org/project/ca-cdk8s-constructs/). Use your project manager of choice to install it.

## Features

There are currently constructs available for:

To request new constructs, please raise an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/citizensadvice/ca-cdk8s-constructs/issues).

## Custom Resource Definitions

The CRDs are found in the `cdk8s.yaml` file, which contains a list of URLs to the CRD definitions.

The generated classes are imported into the `ca_cdk8s_constructs/imports` directory.

If the CRDs are updated, the imports need to be refreshed. There is an Actions workflow that will run weekly to refresh the imports if there are any changes.

### Manually Refreshing CRD Imports

To refresh the CRD imports, run the following command:

```bash
cdk8s import --output ca_cdk8s_constructs/imports
```

## Versioning

New versions of this library will be released via Github Releases and will follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) wherever possible.
