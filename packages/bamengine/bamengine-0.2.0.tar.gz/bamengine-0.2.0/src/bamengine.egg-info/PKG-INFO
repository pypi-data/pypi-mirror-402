# BAM Engine

**Modular Python Framework for the Agent-based BAM Model**

BAM Engine is a high-performance Python implementation of the BAM model from *Macroeconomics from the Bottom-up* (Delli Gatti et al., 2011, Chapter 3). Developed as part of MSc thesis research at the University of Piraeus, it provides a modular, extensible agent-based macroeconomic simulation framework built on ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture with fully vectorized NumPy operations.

Documentation: [https://bam-engine.readthedocs.io](https://bam-engine.readthedocs.io)

> **Note**: This release is feature-complete for the core BAM model but APIs may change in future releases before v1.0.0.

## Features

- **Complete BAM Model Implementation**: Full BAM model with firms, households, and banks interacting across labor, credit, and goods markets
- **Emergent Macroeconomic Dynamics**: Reproduces all simulation results from the reference BAM model, including business cycles, unemployment dynamics, and inflation patterns
- **Research-Ready Output**: Collect time series data and export to pandas DataFrames for econometric analysis
- **Reproducible Simulations**: Deterministic execution with seed control for exact replication of results
- **YAML Configuration**: Modify model parameters without touching code
- **Extensible**: Add custom agent variables and economic events

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install bamengine
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.11+. NumPy and PyYAML are installed automatically.

### Basic Usage

```python
import bamengine as bam

# Initialize and run simulation
sim = bam.Simulation.init(n_firms=100, n_households=500, seed=42)
results = sim.run(n_periods=100)

# Export to pandas DataFrame
df = results.to_dataframe()
```

## Architecture

BAM Engine uses an ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture: agents are lightweight entities with immutable IDs, state lives in Role components stored as NumPy arrays, and behavior is defined by Event systems executed via a YAML-configurable pipeline. This design separates data from logic, enabling high performance through vectorized operations while maintaining extensibility for custom roles, events, and relationships.
