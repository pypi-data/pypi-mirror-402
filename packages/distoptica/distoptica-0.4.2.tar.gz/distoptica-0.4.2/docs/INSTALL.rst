Instructions for installing and uninstalling ``distoptica``
===========================================================



Installing ``distoptica``
-------------------------

For all installation scenarios, first open up the appropriate command line
interface. On Unix-based systems, you would open a terminal. On Windows systems
you would open an Anaconda Prompt as an administrator.

Before installing ``distoptica``, it is recommended that users install
``PyTorch`` in the same environment that they intend to install ``distoptica``
according to the instructions given `here
<https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ for their preferred PyTorch
installation option.



Installing ``distoptica`` using ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing ``distoptica``, make sure that you have activated the
(virtual) environment in which you intend to install said package. After which,
simply run the following command::

  pip install distoptica

The above command will install the latest stable version of ``distoptica``.

To install the latest development version from the main branch of the
`distoptica GitHub repository <https://github.com/mrfitzpa/distoptica>`_, one
must first clone the repository by running the following command::

  git clone https://github.com/mrfitzpa/distoptica.git

Next, change into the root of the cloned repository, and then run the following
command::

  pip install .

Note that you must include the period as well. The above command executes a
standard installation of ``distoptica``.

Optionally, for additional features in ``distoptica``, one can install
additional dependencies upon installing ``distoptica``. To install a subset of
additional dependencies (along with the standard installation), run the
following command from the root of the repository::

  pip install .[<selector>]

where ``<selector>`` can be one of the following:

* ``tests``: to install the dependencies necessary for running unit tests;
* ``examples``: to install the dependencies necessary for executing files stored
  in ``<root>/examples``, where ``<root>`` is the root of the repository;
* ``docs``: to install the dependencies necessary for documentation generation;
* ``all``: to install all of the above optional dependencies.

Alternatively, one can run::

  pip install distoptica[<selector>]

elsewhere in order to install the latest stable version of ``distoptica``, along
with the subset of additional dependencies specified by ``<selector>``. 



Installing ``distoptica`` using ``conda``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before proceeding, make sure that you have activated the (virtual) ``conda``
environment in which you intend to install said package. For Windows systems,
users must install ``PyTorch`` separately prior to following the remaining
instructions below.

To install ``distoptica`` using the ``conda`` package manager, run the following
command::

  conda install -c conda-forge distoptica

The above command will install the latest stable version of ``distoptica``.



Uninstalling ``distoptica``
---------------------------

If ``distoptica`` was installed using ``pip``, then to uninstall, run the
following command::

  pip uninstall distoptica

If ``distoptica`` was installed using ``conda``, then to uninstall, run the
following command::

  conda remove distoptica
