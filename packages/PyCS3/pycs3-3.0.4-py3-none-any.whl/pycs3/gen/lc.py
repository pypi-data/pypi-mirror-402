    A class to handle light curves of lensed QSO images.

    The actual information is stored into independent "vectors" (1D numpy arrays) : one for time, one for magnitude...

    An exception to this is the properties attribute : a list of dicts, one for each data point,
    usually all containing the same fields.

    Note that a lightcurve MUST always be chronologically ordered, this allows faster algorithms.
    See methods :meth:`pycs3.gen.lc.LightCurve.sort` and :meth:`pycs3.gen.lc.LightCurve.validate`.
    Importation functions should automatically sort().

    .. note:: There is only one remaining philosophy about handling shifts of lightcurves:  use :meth:`pycs3.gen.lc.LightCurve.shifttime` and cie, this is fast and you do not change the actual data (recommended)
