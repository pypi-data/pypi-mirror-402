"""
What we call a season is in fact a way of specifying any "connected" range of points in a lightcurve.
Seasons are needed for microlensing, polynomial methods, etc.
Functions that want or return "seasons" usually handle lists of these season objects.
And as such lists of seasons are so common, there are a few functions below that directly handle lists of seasons.
