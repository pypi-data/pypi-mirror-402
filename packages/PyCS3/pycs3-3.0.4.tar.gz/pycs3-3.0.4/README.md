PyCS3 is a software toolbox to estimate time delays between multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars, developed within the [COSMOGRAIL](http://www.cosmograil.org) collaboration. This is an update of [PyCS](https://github.com/COSMOGRAIL/PyCS), which is no longer maintained. 


Proceed to the [documentation](https://cosmograil.gitlab.io/PyCS3/) to get further information. In case of any questions, feel free to open an issue here on GitLab.
