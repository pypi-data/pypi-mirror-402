## ⚡ The Pain

The **EU AI Act** is here. If your software uses ML libraries (e.g., `torch`, `sklearn`, `face_recognition`), you are likely regulated.

* **Fines:** Up to 7% of global turnover.
* **Lawyers:** €500/hour.
* **Manual Work:** Weeks of spreadsheet hell.

## 🛡️ The Solution

`ai-act-check` is the open-source standard. It scans your code, identifies regulated libraries, and tells you if you are "High Risk."

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install ai-act-check
```

### 2. Scan Your Repo

```bash
ai-act-check scan ./my-project
```

*Output: Immediate detection of High Risk libraries (Biometrics, Critical Infra, Employment).*

### 3. Draft Documentation (Teaser)

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
ai-act-check draft scan_results.json
```

*Generates a basic Annex IV draft.*
