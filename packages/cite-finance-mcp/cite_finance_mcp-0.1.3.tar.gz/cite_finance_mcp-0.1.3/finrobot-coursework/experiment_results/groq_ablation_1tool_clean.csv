- Support: none until the June low ≈ $455.

Forward 1-week playbook  
1. Expect a test of $455-460 unless the stock immediately reclaims $478 with volume.  
2. RSI already sub-35, so a reflex bounce is possible; sell any rally that stalls below $485.  
3. Earnings are out of the way, no macro catalysts scheduled → price action will follow broad tech sentiment and the dollar.  
4. Option skew is flat; long puts at the $470 or $460 strike (exp 5 Dec) cost <1.5 % of spot and offer asymmetric payoff if the break of $465 triggers",False,,[],[],

Actionable plan for the coming 5 sessions  
1. Trade bias: neutral-down; don’t chase opens above 303.  
2. Short-term swing: short rallies into 303-306 with a 278 target, stop on daily close >307.  
3. Investors: wait for a decisive close above 306 on >65 M volume to confirm resumption toward 315-320; else expect 278-270 retest first.
