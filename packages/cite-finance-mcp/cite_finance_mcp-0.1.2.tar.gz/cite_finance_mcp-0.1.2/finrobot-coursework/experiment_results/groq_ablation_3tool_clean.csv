1. Volatility spike: 6.4 % intraday range on 19 Nov (low 286.63 → high 303.81) and 5.8 % on 20 Nov; average true range has roughly doubled vs. the prior month.  
2. Failed breakout: The push above 303 on 19-20 Nov reversed hard, leaving a “bull-trap” wick and close in the lower half of the range both days.  
3. Volume confirmation: 68-74 M shares on the two reversal days vs. 20-day average ~45 M – high volume on a failed breakout is distributive, not constructive.  
4. Support/resistance: 303-306 is now a short-term ceiling; 286-288 held twice and is the first support shelf, followed by the 200-day SMA (currently ~275).

- Friday’s intraday range 6.4 % and close in the lower 25 % of the day = sellers in control.  
- No support until the June gap ~$170; next resistance $185 (last week’s breakdown level).

Actionable outlook (next 5 sessions):  
1. Short-term bias remains bearish while price stays below $185.  
2. Look for a wash-out test of $170–$172; a volume-led rebound from there would set a quick oversold bounce toward $180.  
3. If $170 fails on >300 M volume, expect acceleration toward $160.
