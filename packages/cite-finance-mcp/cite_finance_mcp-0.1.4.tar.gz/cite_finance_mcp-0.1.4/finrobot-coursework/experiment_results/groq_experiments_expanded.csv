The stock has been experiencing high volatility, with a range of $3.39 (2.2% of the current price) over the past 5 days.

**Technical indicators:**

* The stock has broken below its short-term support level of $152.
* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 40, indicating a neutral to oversold condition.

However, the dividend yield of 1.71% may attract investors and provide some support to the stock price.
