# Each dependency specifies the required version range to ensure compatibility.

# python: Specifies the Python version required for the project. 
#         Supports Python 3.12 and above.

# aioserial: A library for asynchronous serial communication.
#            Requires version 1.3.1 or higher, but below 2.0.0.

# asyncio: Provides support for asynchronous I/O operations.
#          Requires version 3.4.3 or higher, but below 4.0.0.

# psutil: A cross-platform library for retrieving information on 
#         system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors).
#         Requires version 7.0.0 or higher, but below 8.0.0.

# pyserial: A library for serial port communication.
#           Requires version 3.5 or higher, but below 4.0.

# documentation generation and theming:
#
# - `sphinx`: A tool for generating documentation, version 8.2.3 or compatible.
# - `sphinx-rtd-theme`: The Read the Docs theme for Sphinx, version 3.0.2 or compatible.
# - `sphinx-rtd-dark-mode`: Adds dark mode support to the Read the Docs theme, version 1.3.0 or compatible.
# - `sphinx-fontawesome`: Enables the use of Font Awesome icons in Sphinx documentation, version 0.0.6 or compatible.

# - The `build-backend` field specifies the backend used for building the project.
#   Here, it is set to `poetry_dynamic_versioning.backend`, which likely integrates
#   dynamic versioning functionality into the build process.
#   (The previously commented-out backend was `poetry.core.masonry.api`.)

[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning]
# This section configures the "poetry-dynamic-versioning" plugin for Poetry.
# - `enable`: Enables the dynamic versioning functionality.
# - `vcs`: Specifies the version control system to use for versioning (e.g., "git").
# - `fix-shallow-repository`: Ensures compatibility with shallow Git repositories.
# - `bump`: Automatically increments the version based on changes in the repository.
# To use the plugin it needs to get installed via:
# pipx inject poetry "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]
