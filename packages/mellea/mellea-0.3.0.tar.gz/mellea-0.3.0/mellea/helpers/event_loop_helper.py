    In Mellea, we utilize async code underneath sync code to speed up
    inference requests. This puts us in a difficult situation since most
    api providers and sdks use async clients that get bound to a specific event
    loop to make requests. These clients are typically long-lasting and sometimes
    cannot be easily reinstantiated on demand to avoid these issues.
    By declaring a single event loop for these async requests,
    Mellea avoids these client issues.

    Note: This implementation requires that sessions/backends be run only through
    the top-level / session sync or async interfaces, not both. You will need to
    reinstantiate your backend if switching between the two.
