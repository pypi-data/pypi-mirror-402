// All the business logic of this library is scattered in small object
// such as <Experiment>, <Identification>, <Ant> ,
// <FramePointer>. This class is here to avoid to scatter the
// marshalling/unmarshalling logic of this object to be scatter over
// all of them.
//
// This approach gives the benefit that the read/write logic is
// completely decoupled from these objects, and we can know supports
// different file type version, or change this logic completely
// without touching any of these objects.
//
//
// ExperimentReadWriter is therefore an abstract interface, where
// differnet file format version could use different logic by
// re-implementing <DoOpen> or <DoSave>.
//
// To save or open an <priv::Experiment> using the default file
// format, simply use the <Open> and <Save> methods.
