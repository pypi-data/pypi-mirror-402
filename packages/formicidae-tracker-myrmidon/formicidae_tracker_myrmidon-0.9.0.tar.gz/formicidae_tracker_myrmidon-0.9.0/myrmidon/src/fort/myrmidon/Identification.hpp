/**
 * Relates tags to Ant.
 *
 * An Identification relates a ::TagID to an Ant, with Time validity
 * data and geometric data.
 *
 * @note An Identification can only be created from an Experiment with
 * Experiment::AddIdentification.
 *
 * Time validy
 * ===========
 *
 * Identification are bounded in Time in the range
 * [Start(),End()[. Start() can be Time::SinceEver() and End() can be
 * Time::ForEver(). These value are modifiable with SetStart() and
 * SetEnd().
 *
 * Internally `fort-myrmidon` ensure time validity of
 * Identification. It means that:
 *
 * * Two Identification using the same TagValue cannot overlap in Time.
 * * Two Identification pointing to the same Ant cannot overlap in Time.
 *
 * Pose information
 * ================
 *
 * Identification also contains geometric information on how the
 * detected tag is related to the observed Ant. These are the
 * translation and rotation of the Ant, in the tag coordinate reference.
 *
 * Usually, this information is automatically generated from the manual
 * measurement #HEAD_TAIL_MEASUREMENT_TYPE made in
 * `fort-studio`. Alternatively, users can override this behavior by
 * setting themselves the relative pose using
 * SetUserDefinedAntPose(). ClearUserDefinedAntPose() can be used to
 * revert to the internally computed pose.
 *
 * \note Any angle is measured in radians, with a standard
 * mathematical convention. Since in image processing the y-axis is
 * pointing from the top of the image to the bottom, positive angles
 * appears clockwise.
 *
 * Tag Size
 * ========
 *
 * Identifications also contains the information of the physical tag
 * size used to identify the individual. It can be accessed and set
 * with TagSize and SetTagSize. The value DEFAULT_TAG_SIZE (i.e. 0.0)
 * indicates that the Experiment::DefaultTagSize should be
 * used. Therefore, for most Ant, this field should be kept to
 * DEFAULT_TAG_SIZE, appart for a few individuals, for examples,
 * Queens.
