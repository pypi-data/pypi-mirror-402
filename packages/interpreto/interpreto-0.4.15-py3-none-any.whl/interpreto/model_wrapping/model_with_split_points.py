    Activation selection strategies for `ModelWithSplitPoints.get_activations()`.

    - ``ALL_TOKENS``:
        the raw activations are flattened ``(n x l, d)``.
        Hence, each token activation is now considered as a separate element.
        This includes special tokens such as [CLS], [SEP], [EOS], [PAD], etc.

    - ``CLS_TOKEN``:
        for each sample, only the first token (e.g. ``[CLS]``) activation is returned ``(n, d)``.
        This will raise an error if the model is not `ForSequenceClassification`.

    - ``SAMPLE``:
        special tokens are removed and the remaining ones are aggregated on the whole sample ``(n, d)``.

    - ``SENTENCE``:
        special tokens are removed and the remaining ones are aggregate by sentences.
        Then the activations are flattened.
        ``(n x g, d)`` where `g` is the number of sentences in the input.

    """Code: [:octicons-mark-github-24: model_wrapping/model_with_split_points.py` ](https://github.com/FOR-sight-ai/interpreto/blob/dev/interpreto/model_wrapping/model_with_split_points.py)

    The `ModelWithSplitPoints` is a wrapper around your HuggingFace model.
    Its goal is to allow you to split your model at specified locations and extract activations.

    It is one of the key component of the Concept-Based Explainers framework in Interpreto.
    Indeed, any Interpreto concept explainer is built around a `ModelWithSplitPoints` object.
    Because, splitting the model is the first step of the concept-based explanation process.

    It is based on the `LanguageModel` class from NNsight and inherits its functionalities.
    In a sense, the LanguageModel class is a wrapper around the HuggingFace model.
    The `ModelWithSplitPoints` class is a wrapper around the LanguageModel class.

    We often shorten the `ModelWithSplitPoints` class as `MWSP` and instances as `mwsp`.

    Arguments:
        model_or_repo_id (str | transformers.PreTrainedModel): One of:

            * A `str` corresponding to the ID of the model that should be loaded from the HF Hub.
            * A `str` corresponding to the local path of a folder containing a compatible checkpoint.
            * A preloaded `transformers.PreTrainedModel` object.
            If a string is provided, a automodel should also be provided.

        split_points (str | Sequence[str] | int | Sequence[int]): One or more to split locations inside the model.
            Either one of the following:

            * A `str` corresponding to the path of a split point inside the model.
            * An `int` corresponding to the n-th layer.
            * A `Sequence[str]` or `Sequence[int]` corresponding to multiple split points.

            Example: `split_points='cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm'` correspond to a split
            after the LayerNorm layer in the MLM head (assuming a `BertForMaskedLM` model in input).

        automodel (type[AutoModel]): Huggingface [AutoClass](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#natural-language-processing)
            corresponding to the desired type of model (e.g. `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`).

            :warning: `automodel` **must be defined** if `model_or_repo_id` is `str`, since the the model class
                cannot be known otherwise.

        config (PretrainedConfig): Custom configuration for the loaded model.
            If not specified, it will be instantiated with the default configuration for the model.

        tokenizer (PreTrainedTokenizer | PreTrainedTokenizerFast | None): Custom tokenizer for the loaded model.
            If not specified, it will be instantiated with the default tokenizer for the model.

            :warning: If `model_or_repo_id` is a `transformers.PreTrainedModel` object, then `tokenizer` **must be defined**.

        batch_size (int): Batch size for the model.

        device_map (torch.device | str | None): Device map for the model. Directly passed to the model.

        output_tuple_index (int | None): If the output at the split point is a tuple, this is the index of the hidden state.
            If `None`, an element with 3 dimensions is searched for.
            If not found, an error is raised.
            If several elements are found, an error is raised.

    Attributes:
        activation_granularities (ActivationGranularity):
            Enumeration of the available granularities for the `get_activations` method.

        aggregation_strategies (GranularityAggregationStrategy):
            Enumeration of the available aggregation strategies for the `get_activations` method.

        automodel (type[AutoModel]): The [AutoClass](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#natural-language-processing)
            corresponding to the loaded model type.

        batch_size (int): Batch size for the model.

        output_tuple_index (int | None): If the output at the split point is a tuple, this is the index of the hidden state.
            If `None`, an element with 3 dimensions is searched for.
            If not found, an error is raised.
            If several elements are found, an error is raised.

        repo_id (str): Either the model id in the HF Hub, or the path from which the model was loaded.

        split_points (list[str]): Getter/setters for model paths corresponding to split points inside the loaded model.
            Automatically handle validation, sorting and resolving int paths to strings.

        tokenizer (PreTrainedTokenizer): Tokenizer for the loaded model, either given by the user or loaded from the repo_id.

        _model (transformers.PreTrainedModel): Huggingface transformers model wrapped by NNSight.

        In theory, we could use the same code for most granularities thanks to the `granularity_indices` argument.
        However, we do special cases to go faster for some granularities.

        The way activations indices are treated is far from trivial. Here is an example:
        This indices are the same we defined in `Granularity`, lets take an example with the `WORD` granularity.

        >>> example:list[str] = [
        ...     "A BC DEF",
        ...     "abc de f"
        ... ]
        >>> indices = Granularity.WORD.get_indices(example, tokenizer)
        >>> indices
        [
             [ [0], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5] ],
             [ [0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5] ],
        ]

        Here, the word `"abc"` belongs to the second sample;
        therefore, we need to look at the second element of the `indices` list.
        `"abc"` is the first word, thus the first granular element of this second sample.
        Therefore, `[0, 1, 2]`,
        which tells us that the word `"abc"` is formed with the first three tokens of the second sample.

        If we had to use this information to obtain the activations of the word `"abc"`,
        we would look at the activations of shape (n, l, d).
        Then extract the elements of interest by `activations[1, [0, 1, 2], :]`,
        the second sample, first three tokens, all of the model dimensions.
        The final step would be the aggregation over the token dimension.

        By applying this operation to all words, we would obtain six activation vectors, as we have six words.
        Words are kept by sample, here there are two samples, sol the list has two elements.
        Each element is a tensor of shape (g, d), where g is the number of granular elements in one input.
        In our case g is 3 for both samples, so the list has two elements of shape (3, d).

                Token activations of shape  n * (l, d) are aggregated on the sequence length dimension.
                The concatenated into (ng, d) tensors.

                Existing strategies are:

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.SUM``:
                    Tokens activations are summed along the sequence length dimension.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.MEAN``:
                    Tokens activations are averaged along the sequence length dimension.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.MAX``:
                    The maximum of the token activations along the sequence length dimension is selected.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.SIGNED_MAX``:
                    The maximum of the absolute value of the activations multiplied by its initial sign.
                    signed_max([[-1, 0, 1, 2], [-3, 1, -2, 0]]) = [-3, 1, -2, 2]

            pad_side (str | None):
                'left' or 'right' — side on which to apply padding along dim=1 only for ALL strategy.
                Forced right for classification models and left for causal LMs.

            tqdm_bar (bool):
                Whether to display a progress bar.

            include_predicted_classes (bool):
                Whether to include the predicted classes in the output dictionary.
                Only applicable for classification models.

            flatten_activations (bool):
                Whether to flatten the activations tensors.

                - If True, the activations will be flattened from (n, l, d) to (n x l, d).
                    It allows stocking the activations for a given layer in a single tensor.

                - If False, for each layer, a list of sample-wise activations will be returned.

            model_forward_kwargs (dict):
                Additional keyword arguments passed to the model forward pass.

        Returns:
            (dict[str, LatentActivations]) Dictionary having one key, value pair for each split point defined for the model. Keys correspond to split
                names in `self.split_points`, while values correspond to the extracted activations for the split point
                for the given `inputs`.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.activation_granularities.ALL_TOKENS``:
                    the raw activations are flattened ``(n x l, d)``.
                    Hence, each token activation is now considered as a separate element.
                    This includes special tokens such as [CLS], [SEP], [EOS], [PAD], etc.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.activation_granularities.CLS_TOKEN``:
                    for each sample, only the first token (e.g. ``[CLS]``) activation is returned ``(n, d)``.
                    This will raise an error if the model is not `ForSequenceClassification`.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.activation_granularities.SENTENCE``:
                    special tokens are removed and the remaining ones are aggregate by sentences.
                    Then the activations are flattened.
                    ``(n x g, d)`` where `g` is the number of sentences in the input.
                    The split is defined by `interpreto.commons.granularity.Granularity.SENTENCE`.
                    Requires `spacy` to be installed.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.activation_granularities.TOKEN``:
                    the raw activations are flattened, but the special tokens are removed.
                    ``(n x g, d)`` where `g` is the number of non-special tokens in the input.
                    This is the default granularity.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.activation_granularities.WORD``:
                    the special tokens are removed and the remaining ones are aggregate by words.
                    Then the activations are flattened.
                    ``(n x g, d)`` where `g` is the number of words in the input.
                    The split is defined by `interpreto.commons.granularity.Granularity.WORD`.

                Strategy to aggregate token activations into larger inputs granularities.
                Applied for `WORD` and `SENTENCE` activation strategies.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.MEAN``:
                    Tokens activations are averaged along the sequence length dimension.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.MAX``:
                    The maximum of the token activations along the sequence length dimension is selected.

                - ``ModelWithSplitPoints.aggregation_strategies.SIGNED_MAX``:
                    The maximum of the absolute value of the activations multiplied by its initial sign.
