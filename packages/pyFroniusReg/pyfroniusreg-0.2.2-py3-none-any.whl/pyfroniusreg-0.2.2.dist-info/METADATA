# pyFroniusReg

The aim of this python library is to provide some nice to use abstractions to interact with Fronius(tm) solar inverters and storage systems over ModBus. It is tested on a Gen24 Primo 5kW system with an attached BYD battery storage system using 'float' mode of the sunspec ModBus over TCP protocol. Some testing has been done in int&sf mode.

# Installation

Currently you can grab the .whl from the releases page. I'll figure out PyPI addition eventually

# Examples

check_peak.py: Designed to be run from a cron job to check if we have enough storage to run the house for the peak pricing periods.

force_charge.py: Use the library to force my system to charge at 2.5kW

read_regs.py: Use the library to read some relevant registers from the non-storage inverter

read_regs_storage.py: use the library to read some relevant registers from the storage inverter

reset_charge.py: Use the library to set my storage system back to defaults


# Acknowledgements

A lot of ideas and some orignating code came from:

Special thanks to VK2TTY <@vk2tty@mastodon.radio> for their generous assistance in bringing me up to speed with a more pythonic way of doing things!
