# [PyPtP](https://github.com/phasetophase/pyptp)

Open-source Python SDK for electrical grid calculations and modelling.

PyPtP enables Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and developers to integrate with Phase to Phase's electrical network modeling ecosystem. Access electrical network data in the native formats used by Gaia (LV networks) and Vision (MV networks) software.

> **Alpha status**: PyPtP is currently in alpha. The library provides full coverage of VNF and GNF data models and we aim for production-quality code, but documentation is still limited and the API may change between releases. We make every effort to minimize disruption, but reserve the right to make breaking changes as we refine the library based on real-world usage.
>
> Moving to beta is contingent on API stability. The best way to support the library right now is to share feedback on developer experience, usage patterns, and API design—via [email](mailto:pyptp@phasetophase.com), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/phasetophase/pyptp/discussions), or [Issues](https://github.com/phasetophase/pyptp/issues).
