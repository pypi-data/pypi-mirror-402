# Vpop calibration

## Description

A set of Python tools to allow for virtual population calibration, using a non-linear mixed effects (NLME) model approach, combined with surrogate models in order to speed up the simulation of QSP models.

The approach was mainly inspired from [^Grenier2018].

### Currently available features

- Surrogate modeling using gaussian processes, implemented using [GPyTorch](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch)
- Synthetic data generation using ODE models. The current implementation uses [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html), parallelized with [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
- Non-linear mixed effect models, see the [dedicated doc](./docs/nlme_model.md):
  - Log-distributed parameters
  - Additive or multiplicative error model
  - Covariates handling
  - Known individual patient descriptors (i.e. covariates with no effect on other descriptors outside of the structural model)
- SAEM: see the [dedicated doc](./docs/saem_implementation.md)
  - Optimization of random and fixed effects using repeated longitudinal data

## Getting started

- [Tutorial](./examples/saem_gp_model.ipynb): this notebook demonstrates step-by-step how to create and train a surrogate model, using a reference ODE model and a GP surrogate model. It then showcases how to optimize the surrogate model on synthetic data using SAEM
- Other available examples:
  - [Data generation using Sobol sequences](./examples/generate_data_ranges.ipynb)
  - [Data generation using a reference NLME model](./examples/generate_data_nlme.ipynb)
  - [Training and exporting a GP using synthetic data](./examples/train_gp.ipynb)
  - [Running SAEM on a reference ODE model](./examples/saem_ode_model.ipynb). Note: the current implementation is notably under-optimized for running SAEM directly on an ODE structural model. This is implemented for testing purposes mostly
  - [Training a GP with a deep kernel](./examples/train_deep_kernel.ipynb)
