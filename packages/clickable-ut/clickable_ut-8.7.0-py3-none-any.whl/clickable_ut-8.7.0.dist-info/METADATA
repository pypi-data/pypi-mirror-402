## Code Editor Integrations

Start QtCreator shipped by Clickable in a project folder via `clickable ide`.

## Development

Please base any development on the branch `dev` and file merge requests against it.

### Run Clickable from Repository

Make sure to install the dependencies listed in `setup.py`, via your package
manager or pipx.

You can run Clickable directly from sources via the `clickable-dev` script.
Add the `--verbose` option for additional output.

It is recommended to add your clickable repo folder to `PATH`.
This can be done by adding `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/clickable"` to your `.bashrc`.
Replace `$HOME/clickable` with your path.

### Linting

Clickable uses flake8 and pylint for linting as well as autopep8 for formatting.
Install them using `pipx install flake8 pylint autopep8`.
Inject some dependencies with
`pipx inject pylint requests PyYaml jsonschema cookiecutter` to avoid
false-positives import-error lints.

Run `make lint` to lint and `make format` to format the source code.

### Run the tests

Install the pytest modules: `pipx install pytest pytest-cov`.

Run pytest to complete the tests: `make test`.
