## 1. Quick Start

### Installation
Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install blackice
```

### Usage (Library)
Use `RegimeDetector` to embed stability logic directly into your Python services.

```python
from blackice import RegimeDetector, RegimeState

# 1. Initialize detector (defaults: window=60, sigma=3.0)
detector = RegimeDetector()

# 2. Feed data points (e.g., from Kafka/Prometheus)
# Returns a DetectionEvent object
event = detector.update(45.5)

# 3. Act on findings
if event.is_anomaly:
    print(f"Instability detected: {event.reason}")
    print(f"Severity: {event.zscore:.2f}σ")
    
if event.state == RegimeState.SHIFTED:
    # Use explicit Enums for type-safety
    trigger_pager(f"Regime shift confirmled: {event.duration}s")
```

### Usage (CLI)
Run the full analysis pipeline on your own data.

```bash
blackice --data <logs.csv> --machine <server_id> --report
```

**Universal Input Requirements:**
- **Input**: A CSV file with columns `['machine_id', 'timestamp', 'cpu_util', 'mem_util']`.
- **Output**: Generates an incident report at `reports/analysis_<server_id>.md`.
- **Logic**: Filters noise using the persistence logic defined in `configs/default.yaml`.

## 2. Motivation

Infrastructure monitoring is plagued by **alert fatigue**. Traditional threshold-based alerting generates noise from transient spikes, while complex ML models introduce opacity and drift.

**BLACKICE** addresses this by shifting focus from *point anomalies* to *persistent regime shifts*. It acknowledges that infrastructure data is inherently noisy and bursty. Instead of training complex models to predict every spike, BLACKICE uses rigorous statistical persistence validation to distinguish between:
1.  **Transient Instability**: Burstiness that returns to baseline (filtered out).
2.  **Structural Deviation**: Shifts that persist beyond a confidence interval (reported).

The system avoids "AI magic" in favor of deterministic, explainable signal processing that can be debugged by an SRE at 3 AM.

## 3. Architecture Overview

BLACKICE is engineered as a streaming processing pipeline, not a batch analysis script. It operates in O(1) memory per metric tracker.

    IR[Incident Report]
  end

    DD[Deviation Detect]
  end

  %% 4. Control Plane Flow

  %% 5. Feedback Loop

```

### Components
- **Baseline Modeling**: Welford's algorithm for numerically stable, streaming mean/variance without history retention.
- **Deviation Detection**: Real-time z-score computation against rolling baselines.
- **Persistence Validation**: Deterministic filter requiring deviations to sustain magnitude and duration thresholds to trigger state changes.
- **State Machine**: Formal transition logic (NORMAL → UNSTABLE → SHIFTED) providing clean audit trails.
- **RegimeDetector**: High-level facade that encapsulates the entire engine into a single, easy-to-use API.
- **Metrics/Reporting**: Generates label-free stability metrics and automated incident analysis files.

---

## 4. Key Features

- **Streaming-First Design**: Processes infinite streams chunk-by-chunk using minimal resources.
- **Constant Memory**: O(window_size) memory complexity regardless of dataset size.
- **Label-Free Metrics**: Quality metrics (detection latency, spike rejection) computed without ground truth labels.
- **Noise Rejection**: Aggressive persistence layer filters 80-90% of transient noise typical in cloud workloads.
- **Automated Reporting**: Instantly generates production-grade Markdown incident reports.
- **CLI-Driven**: Unix-philosophy operational interface.

## 6. Example Output

BLACKICE generates structured incident reports designed for engineering transparency.

### Report Sections:
- **Executive Summary**: Immediate text verdict (HEALTHY/UNHEALTHY) based on confirmed shifts.
- **Signal Summary**: Detailed breakdown of CPU/Memory behavior patterns.
- **Detection Statistics**: Tables showing total events vs. confirmed shifts (often 100% rejection rate for stable but bursty machines).
- **Infra Interpretation**: Automated diagnosis of workload characteristics (e.g., "High variance but stable").

A "Health" verdict often accompanies high instability counts. This is **correct behavior**: it proves the system successfully identified thousands of spikes as non-critical noise, preventing thousands of false pages.

## 7. Design Philosophy

1.  **Conservative by Design**: We prefer missing a subtle shift over waking an engineer for a false positive.
2.  **Deterministic > Probabilistic**: Given the same input, the system must produce the exact same state transitions.
3.  **Explainability > Complexity**: Every regime shift has a clear reason (e.g., *"Deviation persisted for >10 points"*), traceable back to specific timestamps.

## 8. System Properties

### Guarantees
- **Deterministic output** for identical input streams
- **O(1) update time** per data point
- **Bounded memory usage** (O(window_size))
- **No training phase** or learned parameters

### Non-Goals
- Not a forecasting system
- Not a root-cause analysis engine
- Not a replacement for TSDBs or Prometheus
