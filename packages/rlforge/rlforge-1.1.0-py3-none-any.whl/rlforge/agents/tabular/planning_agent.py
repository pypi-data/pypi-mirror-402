class PlanningAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Abstract tabular agent that integrates planning steps to accelerate convergence.

    This agent maintains a Q-table and, optionally, a model of the environment
    for planning-based updates. The planning mechanism allows the agent to
    simulate experience from its learned model, improving sample efficiency
    compared to purely online learning.

    Notes
    -----
    - This is a base class meant to be subclassed. The method
      :meth:`update_q_values` is intentionally left empty and must be
      implemented by derived classes (e.g., SARSA, Q-learning, Expected SARSA).
    - Planning is optional and controlled via the ``planning`` flag and
      ``planning_steps`` parameter.
