and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Support for Python 3.14 is back

### Changed

- Replaced `aiopath` dependency with `anyio.Path`
- Updated dependencies

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- Many big speed improvements
    - Some things are now done in parallel
    - Asynchronous access to the filesystem, should greatly increase responsiveness on slow disks
    - Some widgets are now not showing until they are ready
    - Check for cached doesn't happen for every single entry
    - Loading indicator on startup to let things load faster in the background
    - Config options for loading times notifications and for ignoring cache, mainly for development purposes
- Backspace and left arrow to go back up a level (content → resources → providers)
- Header with status bar, project links and a logo

### Changed

- Redesigned layout
- Providers by the `opentofu` organization are not displayed, because they are forks and originals should be used
- Purge from cache doesn't appear (and doesn't work) when the item is not cached
- Code block selection is now shown in the content window, not as a maximized window

### Fixed

- When exiting the Table of Contents, the document will no longer scroll to the top
- Copy code blocks window now disappears when it loses focus
- tofuref will try to strip long documents to prevent from freezing, target configurable by `markdown_length_target` (default 40 000)
  - For example, `kubernetes_deployment_v1` document is over 170k characters long with many different elements
    that are demanding for underlying libraries to process. For now we're stripping based on heading for
    nested sections, with less nested sections being stripped last.

### Removed

- Temporarily dropped python 3.14 support because `aiopath` is not yet compatible, the speed is worth it for now
- Fullscreen mode, redesigned layout should be good even on narrow viewports
- Log widget, if need be a log file might be added later
- Subtitles moved to the header from subtitles in the border

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- Improved perceived responsiveness during app launch and when loading large providers
    - Subtitles now inform what is happening in the background
    - The screen gets refreshed more often, resulting in somewhat working loading indicators
    - Eliminate initial layout “jumping”
    - Note: Launch may be slightly slower; changes focus on perceived responsiveness

### Changed

- Default borders changed from `ascii` to `vkey`, you can still revert to `ascii` with your local configuration
- Welcome content was refreshed

### Fixed

- Normalized em/en dashes to hyphens so headings render correctly in the content viewer
- Corrected the cache purge notification to refer to the right item type (Resource vs Provider)
- Set a more descriptive subtitle for resource content pages
- Open in browser in the welcome tab now opens this changelog instead of crashing the application

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- Cached guides now display their intended page title instead of their 'name' taken from a doc filename
- In provider window, GitHub repo of the provider can now be opened in a browser with `ctrl+g`
- In provider window, GitHub stats for a provider's repo can now be shown with `s`
- Content can now be opened in browser (on OpenTofu registry web) with `B` for easier searching and sharing

### Changed

- Headers (frontmatter) of markdown documents in the registry are now handled by a proper library
- Numbers are now formatted according to locale
- Number of providers now have spaces around the `/` (out of) symbol

### Changed

- The footer has been cleaned up, less important keybinds are now hidden

### Fixed

- Fallback for providers had an incorrect path

  (they probably didn't work on Windows previously), macOS cache and config move as
  a result of this change

### Added

- API responses are now persistently cached on the filesystem
    - Index of providers is valid for a month, to force refresh: `rm ~/.cache/tofuref/index.json`
    - Providers themselves are valid forever because they are versioned
- If the initial fetch of the provider index fails, a fallback version with top 50 providers and 5 newest versions is
  used
- `u`se (`y`ank) now works in the content window; it lets you select which codeblock found in the content to copy
- `escape` can now be used to cancel search
