## Contributions / Support

This tool is maintained by the Professional Services team and is not included in your GitLab Support if you have a license. For support questions please create [an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate/-/issues/new?issuable_template=evaluate-support) using our [Evaluate support issue template](./.gitlab/issue_templates/evaluate-support.md).

## Use Case

GitLab Professional Serivces shares this script with Customers to run against their GitLab instance or group. Then the customer can send back the output files to enable GitLab engagement managers to scope engagements accurately. There is a [single file generated](reading-the-output.md).

## Install Method

### Versioning

- For GitLab versions < 16.0. use Evaluate version <= 0.24.0. Evaluate switched to using GraphQL queries instead of REST API requests, which can cause some issues retrieving data from older GitLab instances
- For GitLab versions >= 16.0 use Evaluate version > 0.24.0, ideally the latest

### Docker Container

[Docker containers with evaluate installed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate/container_registry) are available to use.

```bash
# For GitLab versions older than 16.0. Evaluate versions newer than 0.24.0 switched to using GraphQL queries instead of REST API requests which can cause some issues retrieving data from older GitLab instances
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate:0.24.0

# For GitLab versions newer than 16.0
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate:latest

# Spin up container
docker run --name evaluate -it registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate:latest /bin/bash

# In docker shell
evaluate-gitlab -t <access-token-with-api-scope> -s https://gitlab.example.com
evaluate-jenkins -s https://jenkins.example.com -u <jenkins-admin-user> -t <access-token-or-password>
evaluate-bitbucket -s https://bitbucket.example.com -t <access-token> # BETA
evaluate-ado -s https://dev.azure.com/<your-org> -t <personal-access-token> # BETA
```

### Pipeline schedule

To schedule Evaluate to run on a regular basis we recommend using the following pipeline:

```yml
image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate:latest

stages:
    - evaluate

run-evaluate:
    stage: evaluate
    # variables:
    #   REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: "/custom/certs/my-cert.crt"  # If you need a custom Root-ca-certificate
    timeout: 4h
    script:
        - evaluate-gitlab -t $API_TOKEN -s https://<gitlab-hostname> -p <number-of-processes>
    artifacts:
        name: Report
        paths:
            - evaluate_report.xlsx
        expire_in: 1 week
```

**NOTES:**

- Configure `API_TOKEN` as CI variable with Admin personal access token and `read_api` or `api` scope
- Add Runner `tags` for using a `docker` executor and **Linux** Runner
- Adjust the number of processes based on [recommendation](#recommended-processes-per-project-count)
- Adjust `timeout` after the 1st run
- Create pipeline schedule under _Build -> Pipeline schedules_

### Local (development / troubleshooting)

Requires Python 3.8 through 3.12 (Python 3.13 is not yet supported).

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate.git   # or SSH
cd evaluate
pip install gitlab-evaluate

# In local terminal
evaluate-gitlab -t <access-token-with-api-scope> -s https://gitlab.example.com
evaluate-jenkins -s https://jenkins.example.com -u <jenkins-admin-user> -t <access-token-or-password>
evaluate-bitbucket -s https://bitbucket.example.com -t <access-token> # BETA
evaluate-ado -s https://dev.azure.com/<your-org> -t <personal-access-token> # BETA
```

To test latest branch commits, remove your local install of `site-packages/gitlab_evaluate*`, e.g.

```sh
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.8/site-packages/gitlab_evaluate*
```

and from the local branch run:

```sh
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate.git@<branch-name>
```

## Usage

### GitLab

Evaluate is meant to be run by an **OWNER** (ideally system **ADMINISTRATOR**) of a GitLab instance to gather data about every project on the instance or group (including sub-groups).

1. A GitLab **OWNER** (ideally system **ADMINISTRATOR**) should provision an access token with `api` and, if your instance has [admin mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/sign_in_restrictions/#admin-mode) enabled, `admin_mode` scope:
   - [Personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token) for instance
     - If you are using admin mode, ensure you enter admin mode for the user running the script
   - [Group access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html#create-a-group-access-token-using-ui) for group
2. Install `gitlab-evaluate` from the [Install](#install-method) section above,
3. Run :point_down:

    For evaluating a GitLab instance

    ```bash
    evaluate-gitlab -t <access-token-with-api-scope> -s https://gitlab.example.com
    ```

    For evaluating a GitLab group (including sub-groups)

    ```bash
    evaluate-gitlab -t <access-token-with-api-scope> -s https://gitlab.example.com -g 42
    ```

    See [Recommended Processes per Project Count](#recommended-processes-per-project-count) to specify the number of processes to use.

    **NOTE:** If you have configured rate limits on your instance to be more strict than the default settings, start with one process (`-p 1`) and adjust accordingly up to the recommended number of processes for your sized instance

    **NOTE:** In the event Evaluate freezes or doesn't finish running while scanning a GitLab instance, re-run your evaluate command with an additional `-r` or `--generate-report` flag to generate a report based on the data retrieved so far

4. This should create a file called `evaluate_report.xlsx`

   For more information on these files, see [reading the output](reading-the-output.md)
5. If you're coordinating a GitLab PS engagement, email these files to the GitLab account team.

#### Recommended Processes per Project Count

Evaluate uses 4 processes by default, which is sufficient for smaller GitLab instances, but may result in a slower scan time for larger instances. Below is a table covering recommended processes based on the overall number of projects on an instance:

| Number of Projects | Recommended Processes |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| < 100              | 4 (default)           |
| < 1000             | 8                     |
| < 10000            | 16                    |
| < 100000           | 32                    |
| > 100000           | 64-128                |

The number of processes is limited by a few factors:

- API rate limits on the GitLab instance itself
- Overall stability of the GitLab instance
- Not as critical as the first two, but overall available memory on the machine running Evaluate is another factor to consider

You can ramp up the number of processes on a smaller instance to speed up the scans, but the performance gains for a large number of processes on a smaller instance will eventually plateau.

```

### Jenkins

Evaluate supports scanning a Jenkins instance to retrieve basic metrics about the instance.

Evaluate is meant to be run by an admin of a Jenkins instance to gather data about jenkins jobs and any plugins installed on the instance. If the Jenkins jobs config are stored on a SCM repo like Github or Gitlab, you will need a token with read repository access to the SCM repo for a deeper analysis.

1. A Jenkins **ADMINISTRATOR** should provision an API token for Evaluate to use during the scan.
2. Install `gitlab-evaluate` from the [Install](#install-method) section above,
3. Run :point_down:

    ```bash
    evaluate-jenkins -s https://jenkins.example.com -u <jenkins-admin-user> -t <access-token-or-password>
    ```

4. This should create a file called `evaluate_jenkins.xlsx`
5. If you're coordinating a GitLab PS engagement, email these files to the GitLab account team.

#### Command help screen

```sh
Usage: evaluate-jenkins [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s, --source TEXT  Source URL: REQ'd

  -i, --insecure     Set to ignore SSL warnings
  --gitlab-token TEXT Optional GitLab token for fetching Jenkinsfile from GitLab repos
  --github-token TEXT Optional GitHub token for fetching Jenkinsfile from GitHub repos
  --help             Show this message and exit.
```

### [BETA] BitBucket

Evaluate supports scanning a Bitbucket Server/Data Center to retrieve relevant metadata about the server.

You can use either a admin or a non-admin token to do the evaluation but non-admin tokens can't pull users information.

1. A user should provision an access token for Evaluate to use during the scan.
2. Install `gitlab-evaluate` from the [Install](#install-method) section above,
3. Run :point_down:

    ```bash
    evaluate-bitbucket -s https://bitbucket.example.com -t <access-token>
    ```

4. This should create a file called `evaluate_bitbucket.xlsx`
5. If you're coordinating a GitLab PS engagement, email these files to the GitLab account team.

#### Command help screen

```sh
Usage: evaluate-bitbucket [OPTIONS]

Options:

```

### [BETA] Azure DevOps

Evaluate supports scanning an Azure DevOps to retrieve relevant metadata about the organization.

<details><summary>

You need to use [Personal Access Token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows) with [Read scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#scopes) to most of the services. Ensure the user who owns the PAT has at least Basic [access level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#supported-access-levels) to avoid missing repository information.

</summary>
