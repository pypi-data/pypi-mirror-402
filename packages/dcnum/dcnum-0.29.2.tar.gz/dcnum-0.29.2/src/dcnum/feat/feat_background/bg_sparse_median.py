        """Sparse median background correction with cleansing

        In contrast to the rolling median background correction,
        this algorithm only computes the background image every
        ``split_time`` seconds, but with a larger window (default kernel
        size is 200 frames instead of 100 frames).

        1. At time stamps every `split_time` seconds, a background image is
           computed, resulting in a background series.
        2. Cleansing: The background series is checked for images that
           contain event data using a lengthy algorithm that is documented
           in the source code (sorry). In short, this gets rid of
           background images that contain streaks of RBCs.
        3. Each frame gets the background image closest to it
           based on time from the background series.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_data: array-like or pathlib.Path
            The input data can be either a path to an HDF5 file with
            the "evtens/image" dataset or an array-like object that
            behaves like an image stack (first axis enumerates events).
        output_path: pathlib.Path
            Path to the output file. If `input_data` is a path, you can
            set `output_path` to the same path to write directly to the
            input file. The data are written in the "events/image_bg"
            dataset in the output file.
        kernel_size: int
            Kernel size for median computation. This is the number of
            events that are used to compute the median for each pixel.
        split_time: float
            Time between background images in the background series
        thresh_cleansing: float
            A positive floating point value for scaling the thresholding
            operation when excluding background images from the series.
            Larger values mean more background images are excluded.
            Set to zero to enforce a fixed fraction via `frac_cleansing`.
        frac_cleansing: float
            Fraction between 0 and 1 indicating how many background images
            must still be present after cleansing (in case the cleansing
            factor is too large). Set to 1 to disable cleansing altogether.
        offset_correction: bool
            The sparse median background correction produces one median
            image for multiple input frames (BTW this also leads to very
            efficient data storage with internal HDF5 basins). In
            case the input frames are subject to frame-by-frame brightness
            variations (e.g. flickering of the illumination source), it
            is useful to have an offset value per frame that can then be
            used in a later step to perform a more accurate background
            correction. This offset is computed here by taking a 20px wide
            slice from each frame (where the channel wall is located)
            and computing the median therein relative to the computed
            background image. The data are written to the "bg_off" feature
            in the output file alongside "image_bg". To obtain the
            corrected background image, add "image_bg" and "bg_off".
            Set this to False if you don't need the "bg_off" feature.
        compress: bool
            Whether to compress background data. Set this to False
            for faster processing.
        num_cpus: int
            Number of CPUs to use for median computation. Defaults to
            `dcnum.common.cpu_count()`.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.23.5

            The background image data are stored as an internal
            mapped basin to reduce the output file size.
