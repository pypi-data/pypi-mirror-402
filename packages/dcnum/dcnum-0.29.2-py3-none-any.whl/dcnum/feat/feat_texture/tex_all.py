    The following texture features are excluded

    - feature 6 "Sum Average", which is equivalent to `2 * bright_bc_avg`
      since dclab 0.44.0
    - feature 10 "Difference Variance", because it has a functional
      dependency on the offset value and since we do background correction,
      we are not interested in it
    - feature 14, because nobody is using it, it is not understood by
      everyone what it actually is, and it is computationally expensive.

    This leaves us with the following 11 texture features (22 if you count
    avg and ptp):

    - 1. `tex_asm`: (1) Angular Second Moment
