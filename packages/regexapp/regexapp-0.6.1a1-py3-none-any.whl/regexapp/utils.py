"""
regexapp.utils
==============

Utility functions and helpers for the regexapp framework.

This module provides reusable functions to support regular expression
construction, validation, and file handling. It centralizes common logic
to reduce duplication across regexapp modules and ensures consistent
error handling, formatting, and integration with YAML configuration
files.

class File:
    """
    Utility class for file operations within the regexapp framework.

    Provides safe and consistent methods for reading, writing, and
    parsing files, with a focus on YAML configuration files used by
    regexapp. This class centralizes file handling logic to ensure
    maintainability, error handling, and consistent encoding practices.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        If a file cannot be opened or read.
    ValueError
        If a filename or file content is empty when required.
    yaml.YAMLError
        If YAML content is invalid or cannot be parsed.

        buffering : int, default -1
            Buffering policy (-1 uses system default).

            Encoding to use for text mode.
        errors : str, optional
            Error handling scheme for encoding/decoding.

        """
        Read and return the full content of a file.

        This method opens the specified file using `get_file_stream` in
        read mode, reads its entire content into memory, and returns it
        as a string. By default, the file is read with UTF‑8 encoding.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            Path to the file to read.
        encoding : str, default "utf-8"
            Text encoding used to decode the file content.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The complete contents of the file as a string.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `filename` is empty after normalization.
        OSError
            If the file cannot be opened or read.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method reads the entire file into memory at once. For
          very large files, consider using a streaming approach instead.
        - Relies on `get_file_stream` for consistent error handling and
          filename normalization.

        Read a file and exit the program on failure.

        Attempts to read the contents of the given file using `cls.read`.
        If an error occurs (e.g., file not found, permission denied, or
        encoding issues), the exception is printed to stderr and the
        program terminates with exit code 1`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            Path to the file to be read.
        encoding : str, default "utf-8"
            Text encoding used to open the file.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The file contents as a string if reading succeeds.

        Raises
        ------
        Exception
            Always raised if any exception occurs while reading the file.
            The exit code is 1.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method is intended for command-line tools or scripts where
          failure to read a file should immediately terminate execution.
        - For safer error handling without exiting, use `FileUtils.read`
          directly instead.

        Write text content to a file.

        This method opens the specified file in write mode using
        `get_file_stream`, writes the provided string into it, and
        returns once the operation is complete. By default, the file
        is written with UTF‑8 encoding.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            Path to the file to write. If the file does not exist,
            it will be created. If it exists, its contents will be
            overwritten.
        content : str
            The text content to write into the file.
        encoding : str, default "utf-8"
            Text encoding used to encode the file content.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method performs a side effect (writing to disk) but
            does not return a value.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `filename` is empty after normalization.
        OSError
            If the file cannot be opened or written to.

        Notes
        -----
        - The file is opened in text mode with write access (`"w"`),
          which overwrites any existing content.
        - For appending instead of overwriting, use `"a"` mode with
          `get_file_stream`.
