**NOW-LMS** is a modern, lightweight Learning Management System built with Flask and Bootstrap, designed to be simple to deploy, configure, and use. It empowers institutions, instructors, and learners by combining essential e-learning features—course management, enrollment, communication, assessments, and certification—into one accessible platform.  


With flexible configuration options, role-based access control, support for multiple databases, and built-in monetization tools, NOW-LMS addresses both pedagogical and andragogical needs in today’s learning environment.

**Version 1.0.0** marks the first stable release of NOW LMS. This release has been validated through comprehensive testing with 880+ automated tests, manual testing of all major features, and multi-database backend validation. The system is ready for production use.

## Documentation

-   Course Creators, refer to the [course creation doc](https://bmosoluciones.github.io/now-lms/course-creator/).
-   System Administrators, refer to the [system administration documentation](https://bmosoluciones.github.io/now-lms/setup/).
-   Contributors, refer to the [development guide](
https://bmosoluciones.github.io/now-lms/CONTRIBUTING/).

Live demo: https://now-lms-demo.onrender.com/

```
User: lms-admin
Password: lms-admin
```

The demo data is reset on every deployment. Please allow time for the free Render instance to wake up.


## Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in the NOW-LMS project!

### Implemented Software Stack

- **Backend:** Python with Flask microframework  
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 with Alpine.js  
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy

### Dependencies

- Requires **Python >= 3.11**

### Quick Start

To start a local server, simply execute:

```bash
# Python >= 3.11
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install now_lms
venv/bin/lmsctl database init
venv/bin/lmsctl serve
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.
The default admin credentials are:

```
User: lms-admin
Password: lms-admin
```

For production deployments, see the [user manual](https://bmosoluciones.github.io/now-lms/setup.html).

Never use the default admin user and password in an Internet-accessible environment. It is recommended not to use easily guessable administrator usernames such as admin, root, or administrator.
Choosing a custom admin username makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your platform.
