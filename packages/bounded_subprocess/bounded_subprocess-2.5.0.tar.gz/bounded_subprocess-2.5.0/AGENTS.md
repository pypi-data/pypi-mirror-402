## Publishing Process

Increment the version number as appropriate in pyproject.toml. Delete old
builds from dist/. Run uv sync to update the lock file. Commit the changes,

and then `uv publish`. In the interactive prompt, you MUST enter __token__
for the username. I know it says that, but I don't read what's on the screen.
The password is in the keychain.
