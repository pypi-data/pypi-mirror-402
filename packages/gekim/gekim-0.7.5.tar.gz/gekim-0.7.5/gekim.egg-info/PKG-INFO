# GeKiM (Generalized Kinetic Modeler)

## Description

GeKiM (Generalized Kinetic Modeler) is a Python package designed for creating, interpreting, and modeling arbitrary kinetic schemes. Schemes are defined by the user in a dictionary of species and transitions, which is used to initialize an instance of the System class. Choose (or make) and initialize a simulator for the instance and run it. Field-specific practices are found in gekim/fields.

## Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install gekim
```

Or directly from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kghaby/GeKiM.git
cd GeKiM
pip install --editable . 
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use GeKiM to create and simulate a kinetic system:

```python
import gekim as gk
from gekim.fields.bio.enzyme.inhib import irrev as ii 

# Define your kinetic scheme in a configuration dictionary
concI0,concE0 = 100,1
scheme = {
    'species': {
        "I": {"y0": concI0, "label": "I"},
        "E": {"y0": concE0, "label": "E"},
        "EI": {"y0": 0, "label": "EI"},
        "E-I": {"y0": 0, "label": "E-I"},
    },    
    'transitions': {
        "kon": {"k": 0.01, "source": ["E","2I"], "target": ["EI"]},
        "koff": {"k": 0.1, "source": ["EI"], "target": ["E","2I"]},
        "kinact": {"k": 0.01, "source": ["EI"], "target": ["E-I"]}, # irreversible step
    }
}

# Initialize a system with your schematic dictionary
system = gk.System(scheme, quiet=False)

# Choose a simulator and go
#   In this example we're doing a deterministic 
#   simulation of the concentrations of each species over time.
sim = system.set_simulator(gk.simulators.ODESolver)
sim.simulate() # Note the lack of time-scale input. It's predicted!

# Fit the data to experimental models to extract mock-experimental measurements
t = system.simout["t"]
final_state = system.species["E-I"].simout["y"]
all_bound = system.sum_species_simout(blacklist=["E","I"])

fit_output = ii.kobs_uplim_fit_to_occ_final_wrt_t(
    t, final_state, 
    nondefault_params={"Etot":{"value":concE0, "vary":False}})

```
