    - flags:
      - `--maxfail-streak=N`: Stop test execution after `N` consecutive failures.
<br> <br>
- ✅ **fail2skip**: Change failing tests to skipped, allowing for better test management and reporting.
- flags:
  - `--fail2skip`: Enable the fail2skip feature.
    - `@pytest.mark.fail2skip`: Decorator to mark tests that should be skipped on failure.

- ✅ **verbose-param-ids**: Enhance test IDs with parameter names for better clarity in pytest reports.
- flags:
    - `--verbose-param-ids`: Include parameter names in pytest test IDs (e.g., `(param1: value1, param2: value2)` instead of `(param1-param2))`
