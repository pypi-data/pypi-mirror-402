# Compressed FHIR

A Python library for storing FHIR JSON resources in a compressed form in memory, optimizing memory usage while maintaining fast access to FHIR data.

## Overview

Compressed FHIR is a specialized library that provides efficient memory storage for FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) JSON resources. It uses zlib or msgpack for compression while ensuring quick access to the stored healthcare data.

## Features

- Efficient memory storage of FHIR resources
- Fast access to compressed FHIR data
- Compatible with standard FHIR JSON formats
- Minimal memory footprint
- Python 3.10+ support

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install compressedfhir
```

Or using pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install compressedfhir
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- msgpack >= 1.0.0
- orjson >= 3.10.16

## Usage

```python
from typing import Any
from collections import OrderedDict

from compressedfhir.fhir.fhir_resource import FhirResource
from compressedfhir.utilities.compressed_dict.v1.compressed_dict_storage_mode import CompressedDictStorageMode


resource1 = FhirResource(
    initial_dict={"resourceType": "Observation", "id": "456"},
    storage_mode=CompressedDictStorageMode.default(),
)

my_dict: OrderedDict[str,Any] = resource1.dict()
my_plain_dict: dict[str, Any] = resource1.to_plain_dict()
my_json: str = resource1.json()

with resource1.transaction():
   assert "email" not in resource1
   assert resource1.get("name") == "Custom Mode User"
   assert resource1.get("active") is True
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
