State Probabilities - All Probability Types (FCFS)

This example demonstrates computation of various types of state probabilities:
- Marginal aggregated probabilities (get_prob_aggr)
- Marginal detailed probabilities (get_prob)
- Joint aggregated probabilities (get_prob_sys_aggr)
- Joint detailed probabilities (get_prob_sys)
