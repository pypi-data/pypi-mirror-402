# LINE Solver for Python 
This folder includes the Python version of the [LINE solver](http://line-solver.sf.net).

## Installation
Requirements: Python 3.10 or later.

## Documentation
The Python syntax is nearly identical to the MATLAB one, see for example the scripts in the Python `examples/gettingstarted/` folder compared to the ones in the corresponding MATLAB `examples/gettingstarted/` folder.

A Python version of the [manual](https://line-solver.sourceforge.net/doc/LINE-python.pdf) is also available.

## Example
Solve a simple M/M/1 model with 50% utilization running: ```python3 mm1.py```. You should then get as output the following pandas DataFrame
```
    Station   JobClass   QLen  Util  RespT  ResidT  Tput
0  mySource     Class1    0.0   0.0    0.0     0.0   0.5
1   myQueue     Class1    1.0   0.5    2.0     2.0   0.5
```
Alternatively, you can open and run mm1.ipynb in Jupyter.

## Getting Started Examples
The `examples/gettingstarted/` folder contains tutorial examples demonstrating key LINE features. Notable examples include:
