# LINE Solver for Python 
This folder includes the Python version of the [LINE solver](http://line-solver.sf.net).

## Installation
Requirements: Python 3.10 or later.

## Documentation
The Python syntax is nearly identical to the MATLAB one, see for example the scripts in the Python `examples/gettingstarted/` folder compared to the ones in the corresponding MATLAB `examples/gettingstarted/` folder.

A Python version of the [manual](https://line-solver.sourceforge.net/doc/LINE-python.pdf) is also available.

## Example
Solve a simple M/M/1 model with 50% utilization running: ```python3 mm1.py```. You should then get as output the following pandas DataFrame
```
    Station   JobClass   QLen  Util  RespT  ResidT  Tput
0  mySource     Class1    0.0   0.0    0.0     0.0   0.5
1   myQueue     Class1    1.0   0.5    2.0     2.0   0.5
```
Alternatively, you can open and run mm1.ipynb in Jupyter.

## Getting Started Examples
The `examples/gettingstarted/` folder contains tutorial examples demonstrating key LINE features. Notable examples include:

## Version
This version is an early alpha release with support for basic models with open and closed classes. MVA, Fluid, MAM, and JMT solvers are mostly functional. Examples that have still some missing functionalities are marked as incomplete by a warning in the header.
