"""
setup.py for the genericlib package
===================================

This script defines the packaging configuration for the `genericlib` library,
enabling distribution via PyPI or installation in local environments. It uses
`setuptools` to specify metadata, dependencies, and packaging rules.

Overview
--------
- Package Name: `genericlib`
- Version: 0.6.0a0 (alpha release)
- License: BSD-3-Clause
- Author/Maintainer: Tuyen Mathew Duong
- Repository: https://github.com/Geeks-Trident-LLC/genericlib

Features
--------
- Provides reusable utilities for accelerating Python development, including
  support for regex generation and textfsm generation.
- Streamlines workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling efficient,
  adaptable, maintainable applications.

Configuration Details
---------------------
- Long description is loaded from `README.md` and rendered as Markdown.
- Dependencies: requires `pyyaml`.
- Packages: discovered automatically via `find_packages`, excluding common
  non-distribution directories (tests, examples, docs, build, dist, venv).
- Project URLs:
  - Documentation: GitHub Wiki
  - Source: GitHub repository
  - Issue Tracker: GitHub Issues
- Classifiers: specify development status, supported Python versions (3.9–3.12),
  operating systems (MacOS, Linux, Windows), intended audiences, and topics.

Usage
-----
This file is executed when installing the package via:

    pip install .

or when building distributions:

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

It ensures that `genericlib` is packaged correctly with metadata, dependencies,
and resources included.
