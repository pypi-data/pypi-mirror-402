Before beginning, <b>ensure all deposits are in the public domain</b> to avoid copyright Infringement<br /><br />

A <b>Deposit Template</b> has been added by default to guide the process of completing the metadata information for datasets in this collection. Select the <b>ADD DATA</b> and <b>New Dataset</b> option on the right-hand side of this page (<i>not the option at the top of the page</i>) when ready to start depositing data. <br /><br />

<b>The purpose</b> of this sub-collection is to store <i>critical climate and health</i> datasets accessible at various locations in one place. Because these datasets are extracted with minimal modification, complete metadata that notes where appropriate citation data can be found is especially important to note. <br /><br />

<b>Additional deposit guidance:</b><br />
1) <b>Subsets of a source dataset:</b> If the deposit is a subset of the source data (ie: selecting subset of variables, specific geographic area, etc.), this should be noted in the <b>Title</b> and <b>Description</b> metadata fields. Include any available metadata, and other information available from the source data website.<br />

2) <b>Metadata About Data Sources</b> field: Include all information that is available. Specific fields to include have been noted in the <b>Deposit Template</b><br />

3) <b>Licensing: </b>Licensing determines the possibility of extraction and posting in this sub-collection. Please review any relevant information to ensure data extraction and posting is permitted. By default, this collection includes ""CC0"" as the license. This can be modified per data deposit and before publishing by clicking on the ""TERMS"" tab of a DRAFT dataset.<br />
4) <b>Adding additional metadata</b>: After uploading the initial requested information and saving your deposit, click the <b>Edit Dataset</b> option on the dataset page to add any additional metadata. <br />
5) <b>Submit for Review</b> : Continue to ""edit"" the DRAFT dataset until you have entered all the available metadata. Once your draft is ready for review, select the ""Submit for Review"" option on your dataset page's top right-hand corner.
