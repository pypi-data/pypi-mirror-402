This module creates some keyboard shortcuts to allow resizing tree view
columns when having some cell in the column focused (in edit mode for
that cell / row). This can improve efficiency, since users don't need to
reach for the mouse when wanting to resize columns.

The following shortcuts are added:

- By default, the width is adjusted in steps of 20 pixels per key press.
- ``Shift + Down Arrow``: Decrease the width of the focused column.
- ``Shift + Up Arrow``: Increase the width of the focused column.

The changed width of columns is reset back to the original once focusing
out of the current row, since this functionality is designed for
temporary visibility enhancement during editing sessions and not for
permanent layout changes. Users can use the standard mouse drag resizing
for permanent width adjustments.
