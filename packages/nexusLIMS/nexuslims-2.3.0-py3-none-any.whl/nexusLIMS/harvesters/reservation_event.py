A representation of calendar reservations.

This module contains a class to represent calendar reservations and
associated metadata harvest metadata from various calendar sources.
The expectation is that submodules of this module will have a method named
``res_event_from_session`` implemented to handle fetching a ReservationEvent
object from a :py:class:`nexusLIMS.db.session_handler.Session` object.

@dataclass
class ReservationEvent:
    """
    A representation of a single calendar reservation.

    The representation is independent of the type of calendar the reservation was
    made with. ``ReservationEvent`` is a common interface that is used by the record
    building code.

    Any attribute can be None to indicate it was not present or no value was
    provided. The :py:meth:`as_xml` method is used to serialize the information
    contained within a ``ReservationEvent`` into an XML representation that is
    compatible with the Nexus Facility ``Experiment`` schema.

    Parameters
    ----------
    experiment_title
        The title of the event
    instrument
        The instrument associated with this reservation
    last_updated : datetime.datetime
        The time this event was last updated
    username
        The username of the user indicated in this event
    user_full_name
        The full name of the user for this event
    created_by
        The username of the user that created this event
    created_by_full_name
        The full name of the user that created this event
    start_time
        The time this event was scheduled to start
    end_time
        The time this event was scheduled to end
    reservation_type
        The "type" or category of this event (such as User session, service,
        etc.)
    experiment_purpose
        The user-entered purpose of this experiment
    sample_details
        A list of the user-entered sample details for this experiment. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_pid`` and
        ``sample_name``.
    sample_pid
        A list of sample PIDs provided by the user. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_details`` and
        ``sample_name``.
    sample_name
        A list of user-friendly sample names (not a PID). The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_details`` and
        ``sample_pid``.
    project_name
        A list of the user-entered project names for this experiment. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``project_id`` and
        ``project_ref``.
    project_id
        A list of the specific project IDs within a research group/division. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``project_name`` and
        ``project_ref``.
    project_ref
        A list of (optional) links to this project in another database. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``project_name`` and
        ``project_id``.
    internal_id
        The identifier assigned to this event (if any) by the calendaring system
    division
        An identifier of the division this experiment was performed for (i.e.
        the user's division)
    group
        An identifier of the group this experiment was performed for (i.e.
        the user's group)
    url
        A web-accessible link to a summary of this reservation
