# Test environment variables for NexusLIMS
# This file is loaded by tests/unit/conftest.py if it exists
# Variables here will be available during testing but won't override
# the hardcoded test environment variables set in conftest.py

# IMPORTANT: All test environment variables MUST start with NX_TESTS_*
# to be loaded into the environment. This naming convention prevents
# conflicts with actual application variables and ensures test isolation.

# NX_TESTS_KEEP_DOCKER_RUNNING - Controls whether Docker containers
# should be kept running after integration tests complete.
# Set to "1" to keep containers running for debugging.
# Set to "0" or unset to stop containers after tests (default behavior).
NX_TESTS_KEEP_DOCKER_RUNNING=0
# NX_TESTS_KEEP_DOCKER_RUNNING=1

# Note: The main test configuration (paths, database, etc.) is still
# controlled by tests/unit/conftest.py to ensure test isolation and reproducibility
