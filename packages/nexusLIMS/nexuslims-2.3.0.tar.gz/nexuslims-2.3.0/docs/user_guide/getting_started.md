Welcome to NexusLIMS! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

```{note}
**Upgrading from v1.x?** See the {ref}`migration` guide for step-by-step instructions on migrating from NexusLIMS v1.4.3 to v2.0+.
```

```{important}
**🆕 What's New in v2.0+?**

Users will not notice significant changes, but the infrastructure powering NexusLIMS has received major upgrades, including:

- **Pydantic Metadata Schemas**: All metadata is validated internally using type-specific schemas
- **EM Glossary v2.0**: NexusLIMS uses standardized field names from the emerging [community ontology](https://emglossary.helmholtz-metadaten.de/)
- **Pint Unit Integration**: Type-safe quantity handling with automatic unit conversion (with future connection to the [QUDT unit ontology](https://qudt.org/) planned)
- **Better Validation**: Strict schema validation catches errors before record building

See [NexusLIMS Internal Schema](../dev_guide/nexuslims_internal_schema.md) for more details on how NexusLIMS handles data internally.
```

## What is NexusLIMS?

NexusLIMS is an electron microscopy Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that automatically generates experimental records by:

- Extracting metadata from microscopy data files
- Harvesting information from reservation calendar systems (like [NEMO](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO))
- Building structured XML records conforming to the [Nexus Experiment schema](https://doi.org/10.18434/M32245)
- Uploading records to a [CDCS](https://github.com/datasophos/nexuslims-cdcs/) (Configurable Data Curation System) frontend

Originally developed at NIST, NexusLIMS is now maintained by [datasophos](https://datasophos.co).

### Key Features

- **Automatic Record Generation**: Creates comprehensive experimental records without manual data entry
- **Multiple File Format Support**: Reads metadata from `.dm3/.dm4`, `.tif`, `.ser/.emi`, `.spc/.msa` files
- **Standardized Metadata** *(New in v2.2.0)*: Uses EM Glossary ontology for field names and units
- **Schema Validation** *(New in v2.2.0)*: Pydantic schemas ensure metadata quality before record building
- **Calendar Integration**: Connects with NEMO lab management systems
- **Temporal File Clustering**: Intelligently groups files into acquisition activities using KDE
- **CDCS Integration**: Publishes records to web-accessible data repositories
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based extractors and instrument profiles for customization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Linux or macOS (Windows is not officially supported)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended) or pip

### Install NexusLIMS

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/datasophos/NexusLIMS.git
cd NexusLIMS

# Install with uv
uv sync
```

Using pip:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/datasophos/NexusLIMS.git
cd NexusLIMS

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

Check that NexusLIMS is installed correctly:

```bash
python -c "import nexusLIMS; print(nexusLIMS.version.__version__)"
```

## Configuration

NexusLIMS requires configuration through environment variables, typically stored in a `.env` file.

### Quick Start

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your settings. At minimum, you'll need to set:
   - `NX_INSTRUMENT_DATA_PATH` - Path to instrument data
   - `NX_DATA_PATH` - Path for NexusLIMS data
   - `NX_DB_PATH` - Path to SQLite database
   - `NX_CDCS_URL`, `NX_CDCS_TOKEN` - CDCS API credentials
   - `NX_NEMO_ADDRESS_N`, `NX_NEMO_TOKEN_N` - NEMO integration

```{seealso}
For complete configuration documentation including all available settings, validation rules, and troubleshooting, see the {ref}`configuration` guide.
```

## Database Setup

### Initialize the Database

NexusLIMS uses SQLite to track instruments and sessions. Initialize the database:

```bash
# Create database with schema
sqlite3 $NX_DB_PATH < nexusLIMS/db/dev/NexusLIMS_db_creation_script.sql
```

### Configure Instruments

Add your instruments to the database. Each instrument requires:

- **name**: Instrument identifier
- **harvester**: "nemo" or "sharepoint"
- **filestore_path**: Path relative to `NX_INSTRUMENT_DATA_PATH`
- **timezone**: Timezone for datetime handling
- **api_url**: NEMO API URL (for NEMO harvester)
- **calendar_name**: NEMO tool name (must match NEMO configuration)

Example SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO instruments (name, harvester, filestore_path, timezone, api_url, calendar_name)
VALUES (
    'FEI Titan',
    'nemo',
    'Titan_data',
    'America/New_York',
    'https://nemo.example.com',
    'FEI Titan TEM'
);
```

## Quick Start

### Run the Record Builder

Once configured, run the record builder:

```bash
# Full orchestration (recommended)
# Includes file locking, timestamped logging, email notifications
nexuslims-process-records

# Dry-run mode (find files without building records)
nexuslims-process-records -n

# Verbose output
nexuslims-process-records -vv
```

### Understanding the Workflow

NexusLIMS follows this process:

1. **Harvest**: NEMO harvester polls API for new/ended reservations
2. **Track**: Creates `session_log` entries with START/END events
3. **Find Files**: Locates files modified during session window
4. **Cluster**: Groups files into Acquisition Activities by temporal analysis
5. **Extract**: Reads metadata from each file using format-specific extractors
6. **Validate** *(New in v2.2.0)*: Validates metadata using Pydantic schemas ({py:obj}`~nexusLIMS.schemas.metadata.ImageMetadata`, {py:obj}`~nexusLIMS.schemas.metadata.SpectrumMetadata`, etc.)
7. **Build**: Generates XML record conforming to Nexus Experiment schema
8. **Upload**: Publishes record to CDCS

The validation step (6) ensures all metadata meets quality standards before record generation. Invalid metadata causes extraction to fail with detailed error messages, preventing bad data from entering the system.

### Session States

NexusLIMS tracks your sessions through several states:

| Status | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `WAITING_FOR_END` | Session in progress | Continue using instrument normally |
| `TO_BE_BUILT` | Session ended, record pending | Wait for automated processing |
| `COMPLETED` | Record successfully created | View record in CDCS |
| `NO_FILES_FOUND` | No data files detected | Check if files were saved to correct location |
| `ERROR` | Record generation failed | Contact facility administrator |
| `NO_CONSENT` | A user did not consent to have their data harvested for the session | Provide consent by clicking "Agree" in NEMO questions (post-run, pre-run, or reservation) |
| `NO_RESERVATION` | There was no matching reservation found for this session | Make sure you made a reservation for your usage event |
