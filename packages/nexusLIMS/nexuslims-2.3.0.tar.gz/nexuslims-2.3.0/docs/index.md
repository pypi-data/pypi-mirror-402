# NexusLIMS

<p align="center">
  <img src="_static/logo_horizontal_text.png" alt="NexusLIMS" width="100%">
  <br>
  <em>An automated Laboratory Information Management System for electron microscopy</em>
</p>

NexusLIMS automatically generates experimental records by extracting metadata from microscopy data
files and harvesting information from laboratory calendar systems.

## Key Features

- **Automated Record Building** - Automatically build metadata records for electron microscopy experiments, with metadata
extraction from proprietary formats, preview image generation,
and more!
- **Facility Management Integration** - NexusLIMS integrates
with the
[NEMO lab management](https://www.atlantislabs.io/nemo/)
system for harvesting of experimental sessions and
instrument information.
- **Comprehensive support for common Electron Microscopy file formats** - NexusLIMS extracts detailed metadata from DigitalMicrograph DM3/DM4 files, FEI/Thermo TIF images, Tescan TIF images, Zeiss TIF images, FEI TIA (.ser/.emi), EDAX (.spc/.msa) EDS spectra, and more
- **Temporal File Clustering** - Intelligent grouping of files into Acquisition Activities based on temporal analysis (with customizable sensitivity)
- **Extensible Architecture** - Plugin-based extractor system and instrument profiles for easy customization
- **Structured XML Records** - Standards-compliant records with comprehensive session and technical metadata
- **Metadata Standardization** - Emerging standardization using [EM Glossary](https://emglossary.helmholtz-metadaten.de/) terms and Pydantic validation (work in progress)
- **Physical Unit Management** - Automatic normalization of physical quantities (voltages, distances, times) to preferred units via Pint
