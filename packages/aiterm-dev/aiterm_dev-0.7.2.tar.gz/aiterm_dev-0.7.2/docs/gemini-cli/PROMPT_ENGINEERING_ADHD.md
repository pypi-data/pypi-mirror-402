# ⚡️ ADHD-Friendly Prompting Guide

**Goal:** Get the right answer fast. Don't overthink it.

## 1. The Golden Formula 🧪
**Role + Task + Constraints = Success**

*   **Role:** Who am I? (e.g., "Senior Python Dev")
*   **Task:** What do I do? (e.g., "Fix this bug")
*   **Constraints:** How do I do it? (e.g., "No explanations, just code")

## 2. ⚡️ Quick Tips (The "Do This" List)

*   **Be Bossy:** Start with a verb.
    *   ✅ "Write a function..."
    *   ❌ "I was wondering if you could maybe..."
*   **Use Keywords:** Like search tags.
    *   "Python, Pandas, CSV, Error Handling"
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Give an example.
    *   "Input: `[1, 2]`. Output: `3`."
*   **One Thing at a Time:**
    *   If it's big, break it. Ask for step 1 first.

## 3. 📝 The Structure (Fill in the Blanks)

Copy-paste this template:

> **Role:** [Expert R Programmer]
> **Goal:** [Create a function to calculate mean]
> **Input:** [A list of numbers]
> **Output:** [The average value, return 0 if empty]
> **Style:** [Concise, use tidyverse]

## 4. 🛑 "No-Go" Zones (Avoid These)

*   **Wall of Text:** Don't write paragraphs. Use bullets.
*   **Vague Words:** Avoid "fix it" or "make it better." Say "remove the loop" or "add comments."
*   **Ambiguity:** "Short" means different things. Say "under 50 words."

## 5. ✅ Checklist (Review Before Sending)

1.  [ ] Did I say **what** I want? (Code, text, list?)
2.  [ ] Did I say **how** I want it? (Bullet points, JSON, Python?)
3.  [ ] Is it **short**? (Can I read it in 5 seconds?)

**Example (Bad vs. Good)**

❌ **Bad:**
"Hey, so I have this data and it's kind of messy and I need to clean it up so I can maybe analyze it later, can you help?"

✅ **Good:**
"Clean this CSV data. Remove null rows. Convert 'Date' column to datetime. Output: Cleaned Python list."
