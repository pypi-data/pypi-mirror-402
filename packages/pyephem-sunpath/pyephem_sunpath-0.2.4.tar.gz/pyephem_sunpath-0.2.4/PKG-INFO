Calculate sunpath using pyephem

*Note:* Pyephem has been depreciated. See https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/. A good alternate is skyfield https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/

Introduction
------------

**Pyephem_sunpath** is built upon pyephem_ an astronomical computation package. From the pyephem_ website we have:

    "**PyEphem** provides basic astronomical computations for the Python programming language. Given a date and location on the Earth’s surface, it can compute the positions of the Sun and Moon, of the planets and their moons, and of any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites whose orbital elements the user can provide. Additional functions are provided to compute the angular separation between two objects in the sky, to determine the constellation in which an object lies, and to find the times at which an object rises, transits, and sets on a particular day."

Pyephem_sunpath uses the a small part of pyephem to calculate the sun position and sun path for any location on earth. The big advantage of using pyephem, is that we will get a high degree of accuracy in the calculations.

Features
--------

- **sunpos()** calculates sun position (in altitude and azimuth) using local time and timezone
- **sunpos_radiance** and **sunpos_radiancexyz** also calculate the sun position. The arguments and results are designed for users of the `Radiance Software <https://www.radiance-online.org>`_.
- function details are in the module documentation and docstrings

Usage
-----

Find the sun position in New Delhi at 1pm::

    from pyephem_sunpath.sunpath import sunpos
    from datetime import datetime

    thetime = datetime(2018, 5, 23, 13)
    lat = 28.6
    lon = 77.2
    tz = 5.5

    alt, azm = sunpos(thetime, lat, lon, tz, dst=False)
    print(alt, azm)
    
    >> 77.5362391561 232.336370505
