"""Upgrade utilities for R2X Core.

This module provides the upgrade execution infrastructure including:

- **UpgradeType**: Enum defining FILE vs SYSTEM upgrade operations
- **UpgradeStep**: Named tuple representing a single upgrade operation
- **shall_we_upgrade()**: Version-based upgrade decision logic
- **run_datafile_upgrades()**: Execute file-based upgrades in priority order
- **run_system_upgrades()**: Execute system data upgrades in priority order

The upgrade system uses a priority queue where lower numbers execute first.
Version comparison is delegated to configurable VersionStrategy implementations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    FILE : str
        File system operations on raw data files (rename, move, modify).

        This is the default upgrade type used in the normal parser workflow.
    SYSTEM : str
        System object modifications for cached systems.
        Applied when loading saved systems via System.from_json(upgrader=...).
        Only used when loading cached systems, not in the default parser workflow.

    r"""Execute a single upgrade transformation on data.

    Applies the upgrade function defined in the step, automatically detecting
    whether the function accepts an upgrader_context parameter using introspection.
    This allows flexibility in step function signatures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Any
        Input data to be upgraded by the step function.
    step : UpgradeStep
        The upgrade step to execute with func, name, and target_version.
    upgrader_context : Any | None
        Optional context object passed to the upgrade function if it accepts
        upgrader_context as a parameter (detected via inspect.signature).
        Allows steps to access global upgrader state. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    Result[Any, str]
        Ok(upgraded_data) on success, Err(error_message) on failure.

    Raises
    ------
    (via Result)
        ValueError if step function signature detection fails (wrapped in Err)
        Other exceptions from step.func are caught and wrapped as Err with message

    Notes
    -----
    Introspection behavior:
    - If function has upgrader_context parameter: called with upgrader_context kwarg
    - If function accepts \\*\\*kwargs: called with upgrader_context kwarg
    - Otherwise: called with only data argument

    This allows upgrade steps to optionally use context without explicit interface.
