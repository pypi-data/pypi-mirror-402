# Authress SDK for Python

This is the Authress SDK for Python. Authress provides an authorization API for user identity, access control, and api key management as a drop in SaaS.

The Nuget package connects to the [Authress API](https://authress.io/app/#/api). You can use Authress to build authentication and authorization directly into your applications and services. Additionally, Authress can be used locally to develop faster without needing an [Authress Account](https://authress.io).
