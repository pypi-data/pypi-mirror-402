# gittwig

A terminal user interface (TUI) for viewing and switching git branches, built with Python and [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

I built this because I wanted a quick way to view git branches and switch between them. Vibe-coded with Claude code.

## Features

- Browse local and remote branches in a navigable list
- View changed files compared to your default branch
- View commit history unique to each branch
- Syntax-highlighted diff viewer
- Checkout branches with Enter
- Create and delete branches
- Fetch, push, and pull operations
- Filter branches with `/` search
- Vim-style keyboard navigation

## Installation

Requires Python 3.12 or later.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RhetTbull/gittwig.git
cd gittwig

# Install with uv (recommended)

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
