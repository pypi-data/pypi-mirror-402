# djvuviewer_examples
This directory contains example files for the [djvu-viewer](https://github.com/WolfgangFahl/djvu-viewer/) project

The examples are taken from [GenWiki (CompGen e.V.)](https://wiki.genealogy.net) where
some 2000 DjVu files needed to be converted from unbundled to bundled to mitigate followup
issues arising from the MediaWiki migration to Version 1.39+
