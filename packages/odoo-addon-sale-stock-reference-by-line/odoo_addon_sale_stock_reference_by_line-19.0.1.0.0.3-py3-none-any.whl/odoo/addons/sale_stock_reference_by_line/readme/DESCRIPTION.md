This module was written to extend the functionality of stock references
(previously: procurement groups) created from a sale order

On itself, this module does nothing. It is a requirement for modules
that need to create a stock reference for each individual sale order
line.

This module was previously known as "Sale Procurement Group by Line"
(``sale_procurement_group_by_line``)
