## Overview

**HashPrep** is a Python library for intelligent dataset profiling and debugging that acts as a comprehensive pre-training quality assurance tool for machine learning projects.
Think of it as **"Pandas Profiling + PyLint for datasets"**, designed specifically for machine learning workflows.

It catches critical dataset issues before they derail your ML pipeline, explains the problems, and suggests context-aware fixes.  
If you want, HashPrep can even apply those fixes for you automatically.

## Features

Key features include:

- **Intelligent Profiling**: Detect missing values, skewed distributions, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
- **ML-Specific Checks**: Identify data leakage, dataset drift, class imbalance, and high-cardinality features.
- **Automated Preparation**: Get suggestions for encoding, imputation, scaling, and transformations, and optionally apply them automatically.
- **Rich Reporting**: Generate statistical summaries and exportable reports for collaboration.
- **Production-Ready Pipelines**: Output reproducible cleaning and preprocessing code that integrates seamlessly with ML workflows.

HashPrep turns dataset debugging into a guided, automated process - saving time, improving model reliability, and standardizing best practices across teams.
