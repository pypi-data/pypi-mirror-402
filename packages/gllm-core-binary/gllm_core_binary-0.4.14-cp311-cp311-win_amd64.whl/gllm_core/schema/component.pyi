class Component:
    '''An abstract base class for all components used throughout the Gen AI applications.

    Every instance of Component has access to class-level `_default_log_level` and `_logger`, as detailed below.
    For components that require high observability, it is recommended to set `_default_log_level` to `logging.INFO`
    or higher.

    Defining Custom Components:
        There are two ways to define the main execution logic for a component:

        1. **Using the @main decorator (Recommended)**:
           Decorate an async method with `@main` to mark it as the primary entrypoint.
           This is the preferred approach as it provides explicit control over the main method.

           ```python
           class MyComponent(Component):
               _default_log_level = logging.INFO

               @main
               async def execute(self, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
                   return "Hello from @main!"
           ```

        2. **Implementing _run method (Deprecated)**:
           Override the abstract `_run` method. This is the traditional approach and still supported.

           ```python
           class MyComponent(Component):
               _default_log_level = logging.INFO

               async def _run(self, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
                   return "Hello, World!"
           ```

        The `run()` method resolves the main entrypoint using the following precedence:
        1. Method decorated with @main in the current class.
        2. Method decorated with @main in the nearest ancestor class.
        3. Method named in __main_method__ property.
        4. The _run method (with deprecation warning).

    Attributes:
        run_profile (RunProfile): The profile of the `_run` method.
            This property is used by `Pipeline` to analyze the input requirements of the component.
            In most cases, unless you are working with `Pipeline` and `PipelineStep`s, you will not need to use this
            property.

            **Do not override this property in your subclass.**

            You also do not need to write this attribute in your component\'s docstring.

        This validates the __main_method__ property and checks for multiple @main decorators
        within the current class definition. Uses MainMethodResolver for consistent validation logic.

        Note: Multiple inheritance conflicts are intentionally deferred to runtime (get_main())
        to allow class definition to succeed.

        Raises:
            AttributeError: If __main_method__ refers to a non-existent method.
            TypeError: If multiple methods are decorated with @main in the same class.

                `None` when no entrypoint can be determined.
