    The StreamEventHandler class provides methods to manage an asynchronous stream, allowing data to be sent and
    retrieved in a non-blocking manner. The stream method yields items from the queue, and the emit method adds
    items to the queue. The stream can be closed by calling the close method, which ensures no further items
    are processed.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name assigned to the event handler.
        color_map (dict[str, str]): The dictionary that maps certain event types to their
            corresponding colors in Rich format.
