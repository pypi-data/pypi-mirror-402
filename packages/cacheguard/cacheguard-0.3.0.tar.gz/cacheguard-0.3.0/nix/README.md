# Nix Development

Here is a basic provided nix shell for development.  I use it as a NixOS developer, however, I use the minimum plumbing to get a "typical" python development experience using virtual environments and not nix for python dependencies.  

## Suggested `.envrc`

See `./config/README.md` for the `.envrc` file that I use.
