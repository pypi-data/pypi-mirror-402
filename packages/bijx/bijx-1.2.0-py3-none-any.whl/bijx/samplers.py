"""
Composite samplers combining distributions and bijections.

This module provides distribution classes that compose base distributions
with bijections to create more complex sampling mechanisms. These are
fundamental building blocks for normalizing flows and other generative models.

Key classes:

- Transformed: Applies bijection to transform samples from a base distribution
- BufferedSampler: Caches samples to avoid expensive recomputation

All samplers implement the standard :class:`Distribution` interface with
sample() and log_density() methods.

class Transformed(Distribution):
    r"""Distribution obtained by applying a bijection to a base distribution.

    Implements the pushforward distribution
    $p_Y(y) = p_X(f^{-1}(y)) \abs{\det J_{f^{-1}}(y)}$
    where $Y = f(X)$ and $f$ is the bijection.

    The transformed distribution supports both sampling (by transforming samples
    from the base distribution) and density evaluation (by inverse transforming
    and applying the change of variables formula).

    Important: Assumes that the bijection does not change the shape/pytree structure
    of the input in the `log_density` method. This is because it defaults to using
    the given prior to determine the batch shape of the input. If this is not true,
    this class can be extended with a manual implementation of `get_batch_shape`.

    Example:
        >>> prior = bijx.IndependentNormal(event_shape=(2,))
        >>> bijection = bijx.Sigmoid()
        >>> transformed = bijx.Transformed(prior, bijection)

        sampling operations. This is compatible with flax.nnx's state
        management.
