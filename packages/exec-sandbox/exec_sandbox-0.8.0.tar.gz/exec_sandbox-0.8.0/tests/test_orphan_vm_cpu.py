"""Tests for orphan VM CPU behavior.

These tests verify that orphan VMs (VMs where the host disconnected without
proper cleanup) consume minimal CPU instead of busy-looping at 100%.

The fix involves two components:
1. vm_manager.py: QemuVM.destroy() now properly terminates processes
2. guest-agent: Detects EPOLLHUP on virtio-serial disconnect and backs off

Background:
- When host disconnects from virtio-serial, kernel returns POLLHUP immediately
- Without backoff, guest-agent would busy-loop consuming 100% CPU
- With the fix, guest-agent uses exponential backoff (50ms -> 1s) allowing
  the CPU to enter WFI (Wait For Interrupt) idle state

These tests intentionally orphan VMs to verify the fix works under various
scenarios including:
- Simple orphan (no destroy called)
- Orphan with network (gvproxy)
- Multiple concurrent orphans
