"""Tests for PID 1 zombie reaping in guest-agent.

The guest-agent runs as PID 1 inside QEMU microVMs and must reap orphan
processes that would otherwise become zombies.

Key insight: A simple os.fork() does NOT create an orphan - the parent
continues running. To create an orphan, we need a double-fork pattern:

    Main → forks → Child A → forks → Grandchild B
                          ↓
                     A exits immediately
                          ↓
                B is orphaned, reparented to PID 1

Integration tests require QEMU + images (run 'make build-images').
