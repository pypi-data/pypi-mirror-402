This library is a proof of concept and I cannot recommend using it. Do so at your own risk.\n|\n\n| **Credits:**\n\n- `Rapptz <https://github.com/Rapptz>`_ for the original library this fork is based on. Without it, the project would not exist.\n- `arandomnewaccount <https://www.reddit.com/user/obviouslymymain123/>`_ for help when the project was first started.\n\nKey Features\n-------------\n\n- Modern Pythonic API using ``async`` and ``await``.\n- Proper rate limit handling.\n- Optimised in both speed and memory.\n- Mostly compatible with the upstream ``discord.py``.\n- Prevents user account automation detection.\n- Implements vast amounts of the user account-specific API. For a non-exhaustive list:\n\n  * Sessions\n  * Read states\n  * Connections\n  * Relationships\n  * Experiments\n  * Protobuf user settings\n  * Application/team management\n  * Store/SKUs/entitlements\n  * Billing (e.g. subscriptions, payments, boosts, promotions, etc.)\n  * Interactions (slash commands, buttons, etc.)\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n**Python 3.10 or higher is required.**\n\nTo install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:\n\n.. note::\n\n    A `Virtual Environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ is recommended to install\n    the library, especially on Linux where the system Python is externally managed and restricts which\n    packages you can install on it.\n\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    # Linux/macOS\n    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self\n\n    # Windows\n    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self\n\nOtherwise to get voice support you should run the following command:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    # Linux/macOS\n    python3 -m pip install -U \"discord.py-self[voice]\"\n\n    # Windows\n    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self[voice]\n\n\nTo install the development version, do the following:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self\n    $ cd discord.py-self\n    $ python3 -m pip install -U .[voice]\n\n\nOptional Packages\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `PyNaCl <https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/>`__ (for voice support)\n\nPlease note that on Linux installing voice you must install the following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. ``apt``, ``dnf``, etc) before running the above commands:\n\n* libffi-dev (or ``libffi-devel`` on some systems)\n* python-dev (e.g. ``python3.6-dev`` for Python 3.6)\n\nUsing with Upstream\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you would like to use the library alongside upstream ``discord.py``, you can install ``selfcord.py`` instead of ``discord.py-self``. Check out the `renamed branch <https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/renamed/README.rst>`_ for more information.\n\nQuick Example\n--------------\n\n.. code:: py\n\n    import discord\n\n    class MyClient(discord.Client):\n        async def on_ready(self):\n            print('Logged on as', self.user)\n\n        async def on_message(self, message):\n            # only respond to ourselves\n            if message.author != self.user:\n                return\n\n            if message.content == 'ping':\n                await message.channel.send('pong')\n\n    client = MyClient()\n    client.run('token')\n\nBot Example\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: py\n\n    import discord\n    from discord.ext import commands\n\n    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='>', self_bot=True)\n\n    @bot.command()\n    async def ping(ctx):\n        await ctx.send('pong')\n\n    bot.run('token')\n\nYou can find more examples in the examples directory.\n\nLinks\n------\n\n- `Documentation <https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_\n- `Project updates <https://t.me/dpy_self>`_\n- `Discussion & support <https://t.me/dpy_self_discussions>`_\n\n\n<!-- vendorization-metadata: {commit_hash: 759ad60d8c47c375d4ddaf101b65b5210e813db0, upstream_version: 2.1.0, vendorized_version: 2.1.0} -->",
