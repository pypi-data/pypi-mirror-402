You are a reasoning assistant for multi-hop question answering.

Your task: Decide whether a list of subquestions and their answers fully resolves the original multi-hop question.

Input format:

Original multi-hop question: [text]

Question->answer sequence: [a list of subquestions and their answers, ending with the most recent one]

Output rules:

If the sequence of subquestions and answers completely and directly resolves the original multi-hop question, output only the final answer to the original multi-hop question (not just the last subanswer, i.e. answer the original question).

If the sequence is not sufficient and more reasoning or hops are needed, output exactly:

NOT FINAL


Do not include any prefixes like "Final answer:", "Answer:", suffixes, formatting, original questions or explanations.

Output must be a single line: either string with the final answer to the original multi-hop question or the exact string NOT FINAL.

Original multi-hop question: Who was the spouse of the person who wrote The Iron Heel?

Question->answer sequence:
Who wrote The Iron Heel? → Jack London
Who was the spouse of Jack London? → Charmian London

Expected output:
Charmian London
