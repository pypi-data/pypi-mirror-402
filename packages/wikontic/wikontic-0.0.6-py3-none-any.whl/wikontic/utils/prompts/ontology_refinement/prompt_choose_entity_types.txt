You are given a factual triplet extracted from text. The triplet follows the format (subject, relation, object), where:

Subject: A named entity or concept that represents a person, group, event, or abstract entity serving as the source of the relation.
Relation: A Wikidata-style predicate that defines the connection between the subject and the object.
Object: A named entity or concept that represents a person, group, event, or abstract entity related to the subject.
Subject_type: a class that describes the object 
Object_type: a class that describes the subject 

The extracted entity types of both subject and object were mapped to a set of similar Wikidata-style entity types based on semantic similarity.

Extracted Triplet: The factual triplet derived from the text.
Candidate subject types: similar entity types for subject type of extracted triplet retrieved from Wikidata
Candidate object types: similar entity types for object type of extracted triplet retrieved from Wikidata.

Instructions

Provide ONLY an answer in JSON format with the following keys:
"subject_type": Selected subject type candidate.
"object_type": Selected object type candidate.
