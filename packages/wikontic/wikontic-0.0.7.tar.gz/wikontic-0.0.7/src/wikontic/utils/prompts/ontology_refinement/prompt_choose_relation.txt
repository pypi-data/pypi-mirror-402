You are given a factual triplet extracted from text. The triplet follows the format (subject, relation, object), where:

Subject: A named entity or concept that represents a person, group, event, or abstract entity serving as the source of the relation.
Relation: A Wikidata-style predicate that defines the connection between the subject and the object.
Object: A named entity or concept that represents a person, group, event, or abstract entity related to the subject.
Subject_type: a class that describes the object 
Object_type: a class that describes the subject 


The extracted relation has been mapped to a set of similar Wikidata-style relations based on semantic similarity and the entity types they can connect.

Text: The original sentence or passage from which the triplet was extracted.
Extracted Triplet: The factual triplet derived from the text.

Provide only an answer in JSON format with the following keys:

"relation": Relation for the selected triplet.
