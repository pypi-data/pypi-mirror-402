    """Check whether any given parameter combination amounts to instant reheating.

    Checks for corner cases where w_reh=1/3 or DeltaN_reh=0 or DeltaN_minus1=0, where we assume
    instant reheating and apply simplified formulas.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N_star : float
        Number of e-folds of inflation after horizon crossing of pivot scale `K_STAR`.
        If this parameter is given, then this assumes non-instant reheating and returns `False`.
        (Even though we could in principle pass the N_star value that would amount to w=1/3 and
        DeltaN_reh=0. However, we would have to actually do the calculation, and this function is
        about checking for the instant reheating corner case before doing the actual reheating
        computation.)
    rho_reh_GeV : float
        Energy density at the end of reheating in GeV.
    w_reh : float
        Equation of state parameter during reheating.
    DeltaN_reh : float
        Number of e-folds during reheating.
    DeltaN_minus1 : float
        Contribution to the calibration of `N_star` or `N_end` that comes from reheating
        but is agnostic to the details of reheating. See Martin & Ringeval (2010), where
        this is called `-lnR_rad`.
