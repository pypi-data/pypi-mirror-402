## [3.0.0a4] - 2023-12-18

- Fixed pyproject.toml packaging.

## [3.0.0a3] - 2023-12-18

- Removed tests and documentation from the packaged archive to reduce its size.
Package size was exceeding Pypi limit.

## [3.0.0a2] - 2023-12-13

### Fixed
- Fix parser format for Coordinates reference system

### Changed
- Moved packaging from setup.py to pyproject.toml ; a bare setup.py has been kept for compatibility with older pip versions
- `\_version.py` file is now generated by `setuptools_scm` during the installation
This rolls back on the possibility of using the library as a submodule without installing it.

## [3.0.0a1] - 2023-11-22

### Added
- Define packer classes
- Add type and shape check for array packer
- Unit tests for packer/unpacker functions
- New packer/unpacker function for object properties
- Black-list for OSEF types to not check parser
- Parse timestamps of OSEF frames without unpacking all the frame content
- Lazy parser ; same interface as the classic one, but data is only unpacked at read
- Lazy packing of an OSEF frame (on lazy parsed data only)
- Non-blocking parsing by separating the`connection` and the `read` functions.
- Add getters in the `osef_frame` module for smoothed pose, road marking bits and ground plane bits
- Custom `FieldException` and `ObjectIdException` when field or object ID is missing in the OSEF frame
- Add properties to get the array of bbox vertices from the TrackedObjects

### Changed
- Deploy library on pypi for every tag
- Update pylint to `2.17.3`
- Use standard array packer for pose and pose array
- Group packers and unpackers
- Update extra keys for OSEF data
- Update named tuple definition for TLV data
- Change object class IDs unpacker to extract only the IDs
- Use OSEF specification keys for types
- **[test_requirements]** update `black`, `pytest-cov`, `pylint`, `responses` version
- Refactored `OsefStream` to split tcp stream and file handling. 
`OsefStream` is now an abstract class, and `create_osef_stream` should be used to get the previous tcp/file indifferent behaviour.
- Update some typings in the `osef_frame` to match the OSEF Specification (some fields are not output by default)
- Enabled OSEF to be used as a project submodule by providing a default `\_\_version\_\_` value
- Move cloud extraction corresponding to an object ID in the osef_frame module
- Remove bindings and definitions attributes in `Zones` to make the class complitely read-only
- Improve field classes initialization (switch to namedtuple)
- Build translations and rotations of Pose arrays before initialization
- Rework the TrackedObjectData list extraction with a condition and optimization
- Optimize computation of bbox vertices and bbox footprint vertices of a TrackedObjectData

### Removed
- Deployment to Nexus
- Remove LidarModel for packing, and just use standard value packer
- Remove streamer and saver
- Remove BoundingBoxData to make TrackedObjectData initialization faster

### Refactored
- Project architecture refactored
- Move edition functions and setters from the `osef_frame` module to a dedicated one in order to have read-only classes.
- Create a `spec` sub-package for modules related to the OSEF specification, types definition, etc...
- Rename modules in `data_types` sub-package
- Move field dataholder classes from `osef_frame` to `field_classes` module
