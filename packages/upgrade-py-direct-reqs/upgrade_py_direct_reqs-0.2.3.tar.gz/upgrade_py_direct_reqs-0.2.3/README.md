# upgrade-py-direct-reqs

**Upgrade only direct dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` safely.**

A Python CLI tool that lets you review and upgrade **only direct dependencies** in a project’s `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, while keeping your pinned versions up to date.

Developed by Miteshkumar N Raval with guidance and scripting assistance from coding agents.
---

## Features

- Lists outdated direct dependencies.
- Prompts for confirmation before upgrading.
- Supports both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` (with `[project.dependencies]`).
- Updates `requirements.txt` with new pinned versions.
- Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- CLI installable via pip in a virtual environment or globally.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Recommended: install inside your existing project virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate  # or myenv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install upgrade-py-direct-reqs
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Explicitly specify your requirements file
upgrade-py-direct-reqs requirements.txt

# Or specify your pyproject.toml
upgrade-py-direct-reqs pyproject.toml
```

- The CLI lists outdated direct dependencies.
- Review versions and confirm before upgrading.
- After upgrade, the `requirements.txt` file is updated with pinned versions.

## Test instructions 

### To run CLI tests with pytest:
``` 
 1. pip install .  (to install dependencies listed in pyproject.toml)
 2. Ensure pytest is installed in your environment: pip install pytest
 3. Run tests from the project root:
       pytest tests/test_cli.py
 4. Tests cover:
       - requirements.txt only
       - pyproject.toml only
       - conflicting dependencies in both files
       - empty requirements.txt
       - invalid toml file name (refer PEP 621 for more details)
