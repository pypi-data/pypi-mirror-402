===========
ScanCode.io
===========

ScanCode.io provides a Web UI and API to run and review complex scans in rich scripted pipelines, on different kinds of containers, docker images, package archives, manifests etc, to get information on licenses, copyrights, sources, and vulnerabilities.

Why Use ScanCode.io?
====================

ScanCode.io provides an easy-to-use front-end to ScanCode Toolkit and other AboutCode projects.The flexible pipeline technology supports advanced scanning tasks such as container scanning and deploy-to-develop analysis. You can run ScanCode.io in a Docker container or install it on a Linux server. It provides full support for generating and consuming CycloneDX and SPDX SBOMs.

Getting Started
===============

Instructions to get you up and running on your local machine are at `Getting Started <https://scancodeio.readthedocs.org/>`_

The ScanCode.io documentation also provides:

- prerequisites for installing the software.
- instructions guiding you to start scanning code.
- tutorials that provide hands-on guidance to ScanCode features.
- how to customize your own pipelines.
- how to use a GitHub action to run ScanCode.io pipelines from your GitHub Workflows. 
- references explaining integration with other AboutCode projects.
- guidelines for contributing to code development.

If you have questions that are not covered by our documentation, 
please ask them in `Discussions <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/discussions>`_.
