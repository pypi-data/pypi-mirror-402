# Cloud Run Scalability Optimizations for 100+ Concurrent Users

This document explains the optimizations made to ensure Cloud Run apps can successfully scale to 100+ concurrent users.

## Executive Summary

The Cloud Run deployment has been optimized to handle 100+ concurrent users efficiently through:
- ✅ **Reduced timeouts** (3000s → 300s) for better resource management
- ✅ **CPU throttling** enabled for cost optimization during idle periods
- ✅ **Startup CPU boost** for faster cold starts and scale-up
- ✅ **Optimized surge upgrades** for smoother traffic distribution during scaling
- ✅ **Thread limiting** in Docker to prevent CPU oversubscription

## Current Capacity

### Standard Apps (judge, ai-consequences, what-is-ai, etc.)
- **Configuration**: 2Gi memory, 2 CPU, concurrency=40
- **Max instances**: 50
- **Theoretical capacity**: 40 × 50 = **2,000 concurrent users** ✅
- **Actual capacity (safe)**: ~1,500 concurrent users (75% utilization)

### Model Building Game Apps (all language variants)
- **Configuration**: 4Gi memory, 2 CPU, concurrency=40
- **Max instances**: 100
- **Theoretical capacity**: 40 × 100 = **4,000 concurrent users** ✅
- **Actual capacity (safe)**: ~3,000 concurrent users (75% utilization)

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Timeout Reduction (3000s → 300s)

**Before:**
```yaml
--timeout=3000  # 50 minutes
```

**After:**
```yaml
--timeout=300  # 5 minutes
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents resource exhaustion from hung connections
- Forces clients to implement proper retry logic
- Faster cleanup of zombie processes
- Better resource allocation for active users

**Rationale:**
Interactive Gradio apps should respond within seconds. A 5-minute timeout is generous for any legitimate user interaction while preventing resource waste.

### 2. CPU Throttling

**Added:**
```yaml
--cpu-throttling
```

**Benefits:**
- CPU allocation scales down when container is idle
- Reduces costs during low-traffic periods
- No impact on performance during active use
- Automatic scaling up when load increases

**How it works:**
When a container receives no requests, Cloud Run reduces CPU allocation. This doesn't affect memory or the ability to serve requests—just reduces billing for idle CPU cycles.

### 3. Startup CPU Boost

**Added:**
```yaml
--startup-cpu-boost
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster cold starts (estimated 20-30% improvement)
- Quicker response to traffic spikes
- Better user experience during scale-up
- Minimal cost impact (only during startup)

**How it works:**
Temporarily allocates additional CPU during container initialization, reducing the time for Python imports, Gradio initialization, and first request handling.

### 4. Optimized Surge Upgrades

**Standard apps (50 max instances):**
```yaml
--max-surge-upgrade=3
```

**High-scale apps (100 max instances):**
```yaml
--max-surge-upgrade=5
```

**Benefits:**
- Smoother traffic distribution during scaling events
- Reduces "thundering herd" problems
- Better handling of sudden traffic spikes
- More predictable performance during scale-up

**How it works:**
Controls how many new instances Cloud Run can start simultaneously during a scaling event. Higher values = faster scale-up but more aggressive resource allocation.

### 5. Docker-Level Thread Limiting

**Already configured in Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
ENV OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 \
    MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 \
    OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
    VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1 \
    NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents NumPy/Pandas from spawning excessive threads
- Avoids CPU oversubscription on 2-vCPU instances
- Lets Gradio manage concurrency at the application level
- Better CPU utilization per request

**Critical for scaling:**
Without these, each request might try to use all CPUs, causing thread contention and drastically reducing effective concurrency from 40 to just 2-3 requests.

## Performance Expectations

### For 100 Concurrent Users

**Standard Apps (judge, ai-consequences, what-is-ai):**
- Required instances: 100 / 40 = 3 instances
- Cold start time: ~3-4 seconds (with startup CPU boost)
- Steady-state latency: 50-200ms
- Memory per instance: ~800MB-1.2GB (out of 2GB allocated)
- CPU per instance: ~50-70% (2 vCPU)

**Model Building Game Apps:**
- Required instances: 100 / 40 = 3 instances  
- Cold start time: ~4-6 seconds (larger memory footprint)
- Steady-state latency: 100-300ms (ML operations)
- Memory per instance: ~1.5-2.5GB (out of 4GB allocated)
- CPU per instance: ~60-80% (2 vCPU)

### Scaling Timeline

**Traffic Pattern: 0 → 100 users in 30 seconds**

| Time | Event | Active Instances |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| T+0s | First request arrives | 0 (cold start begins) |
| T+4s | First instance ready | 1 (handles ~40 users) |
| T+6s | 2nd instance spins up | 2 (handles ~80 users) |
| T+8s | 3rd instance ready | 3 (handles ~120 users) |
| T+10s | **Fully scaled** | 3 instances, 100 users comfortably served |

**With startup-cpu-boost**: Cold start times reduced by ~20-30%

### Cost Implications

**100 concurrent users, 8 hours/day, 20 days/month:**

Standard apps (3 instances × 8 hrs × 20 days):
- CPU-hours: 3 × 2 vCPU × 8 × 20 = 960 vCPU-hours
- Memory-hours: 3 × 2 GB × 8 × 20 = 960 GB-hours
- Requests: 100 users × ~10 req/min × 480 min = ~480,000 requests

**Estimated monthly cost per app:** $5-10 (well within Cloud Run free tier and budget)

With CPU throttling, idle time costs virtually nothing.

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Request Latency (p50, p95, p99)**
   - Target: p95 < 500ms for standard apps
   - Target: p95 < 1000ms for model building apps
   - Alert: p99 > 2000ms

2. **Instance Count**
   - Monitor scaling patterns
   - Adjust min-instances if cold starts are frequent
   - Verify max-instances is never hit

3. **Container CPU Utilization**
   - Target: 50-75% average
   - Alert: Sustained > 90%
   - Indicates need for more instances or resources

4. **Container Memory Utilization**
   - Target: < 80% of allocated
   - Alert: > 90%
   - May indicate memory leak or need for more memory

5. **Error Rate**
   - Target: < 0.1%
   - Alert: > 1%
   - Watch for timeout errors specifically

### Setting Up Alerts

```bash
# Example: Alert on high latency
gcloud monitoring policies create \
  --notification-channels=CHANNEL_ID \
  --display-name="High Latency - Judge App" \
  --condition-display-name="P95 Latency > 2s" \
  --condition-threshold-value=2 \
  --condition-threshold-duration=60s
```

## Load Testing Recommendations

### Automated Load Tests Available

Comprehensive load tests are now available in `tests/load_tests/`. See the [Load Tests README](tests/load_tests/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Quick Start - Manual Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r tests/load_tests/requirements.txt

# Run test with 100 concurrent users
cd tests/load_tests
locust -f locustfile_gradio_apps.py \
  --host=https://judge-HASH-uc.a.run.app \
  --users 100 \
  --spawn-rate 10 \
  --run-time 5m \
  --headless \
  --html=load_test_report.html
```

### Automated Testing via GitHub Actions

Use the workflow to test deployed apps:

1. Go to **Actions** → **Load Test Gradio Apps**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select target app (or "all")
4. Configure users, spawn rate, and duration
5. Review results and download HTML reports

### Expected Results
- **Success rate**: > 99%
- **Mean response time**: < 500ms
- **P95 response time**: < 1000ms
- **Failed requests**: < 1%

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: High Latency During Scale-Up

**Symptoms:**
- Users experience slow responses when traffic increases
- Latency spikes every 1-2 minutes

**Solutions:**
1. Increase `--min-instances` to 1 or 2 for frequently-used apps
2. Verify `--startup-cpu-boost` is enabled
3. Check if database/external API is the bottleneck

### Issue: Containers Running Out of Memory

**Symptoms:**
- OOM (Out of Memory) errors in logs
- Container restarts
- 502/503 errors

**Solutions:**
1. Increase `--memory` allocation (2Gi → 4Gi)
2. Check for memory leaks in app code
3. Review Gradio queue size and concurrent request handling

### Issue: Cold Start Too Slow

**Symptoms:**
- First request after idle period takes 10+ seconds
- Users complain about initial loading

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `--startup-cpu-boost` is enabled
2. Set `--min-instances=1` for critical apps
3. Optimize Docker image size (current: ~500MB is good)
4. Review Python import paths (use lazy imports where possible)

## Future Optimizations

### For 500+ Concurrent Users

If you need to scale beyond current capacity:

1. **Regional Distribution**
   - Deploy to multiple regions (us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1)
   - Use Cloud Load Balancer for geo-routing
   - Reduces latency for global users

2. **Increase Concurrency**
   - Test increasing `--concurrency` to 60-80
   - Monitor CPU and memory utilization
   - May require memory increase to 3Gi or 4Gi

3. **Database Optimization**
   - If using external database, implement connection pooling
   - Cache frequent queries in Redis/Memcached
   - Use Cloud SQL with high availability

4. **CDN Integration**
   - Serve static assets via Cloud CDN
   - Cache Gradio UI assets
   - Reduces load on Cloud Run instances

### For 1000+ Concurrent Users

1. **Migrate to Kubernetes (GKE)**
   - Better control over autoscaling policies
   - Can use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
   - More granular resource management

2. **Implement Request Queuing**
   - Use Cloud Tasks or Pub/Sub
   - Queue non-interactive requests
   - Smooth out traffic spikes

3. **Consider Dedicated Instances**
   - For predictable high traffic, use `--min-instances=10+`
   - Eliminates cold starts entirely
   - Higher cost but better performance
