# Scene Transitions

Craft guidance for moving between scenes—temporal jumps, location changes, seamless weaving, and scene breaks.

---

## Temporal Jumps

### Core Principle

Always orient the reader. State the current time or how much time has passed whenever you skip time, summarize, or move backward/forward.

### Time Skips

**The Trigger Method:**
Lead into time jumps with a trigger—an object, sensory detail, dialogue, or narrative element that serves as a linking device.

> A character touches a photograph, triggering a jump backward or forward.

**Cut the Boring Parts:**
If George just needs to get from the coffee shop to his office, skip the travel. Write only what moves the plot forward.

**Summary Paragraphs:**
When something happens between scenes worth knowing but not worth dramatizing, use a quick summary paragraph at the start of the new scene.

### Flashbacks

**Use flashbacks only when there's no other effective way to convey essential information.** Each flashback must enhance the story; if it doesn't, cut it.

**Transition Techniques:**

1. **Tense shifts** - Use past perfect for first few lines, then transition to simple past
2. **Formatting cues** - Italics, asterisks, line breaks, or white space
3. **Scene breaks** - Add a scene break before entering the flashback

### Common Mistakes

**Multiple flashbacks for one issue:** Write one compelling flashback instead of five making the same point.

**Flashbacks as exposition dumps:** Don't use them as story cheats.

**Interrupting natural flow:** Don't let flashbacks stall narrative momentum.

**When exposition would work:** Don't show an entire backstory scene when a brief summary would suffice.

## Location Changes

### Core Principle

Orient the reader in new locations. Make it clear when you've shifted to a different place.

### The "Arrive Late, Leave Early" Rule

Plunge readers into the middle of action. Don't show unnecessary travel or mundane movement.

Bad:
> When Rachel arrived at her sister's house to borrow the thousand dollars, she rang the doorbell and waited...

Good:
> Rachel sat across from her sister. "I need a thousand dollars."

### Transition Techniques

**Transitional Sentences:**
> Three days later, they arrived in the city.

**Sensory Grounding:**
Use sensory details to evoke the new setting. The scent of salt air and cry of gulls establishes a coastal setting without explicit explanation.

**The Bridging Technique:**
Choose something at the end of the previous scene that mirrors the beginning of the next. An image, symbol, or similar element connecting the scenes creates elegant transitions.

### When Location Changes Don't Need Full Scenes

If characters are on a continuous journey through multiple locations, scene breaks aren't necessary. Geographic distance doesn't matter—only whether the jump feels jarring.

### Common Mistakes

**Travel Descriptions:**
Don't take too much time showing the transition. Don't describe everything along the way unless something important happens during travel.

## Seamless Weaving

### Core Philosophy

Readers shouldn't notice your transitions—that's the goal. Good transitions feel seamless, happening right under a reader's nose.

### What Makes Transitions Jarring

1. **Jump cuts with no setup** - Dropping readers into a new scene without context
2. **Time or location ambiguity** - Readers can't tell how much time passed or where they are
3. **Emotional dissonance** - Character leaves heartbroken, enters next scene cheerful with no explanation
4. **Missing information** - Awkward shifts making readers wonder what happened

### Techniques for Seamless Flow

**Scene Anchors and Emotional Echoes:**
Anchors give readers clarity (when/where). Echoes give readers continuity (emotional throughline).

**Emotional and Thematic Connections:**
Powerful shifts often begin with subtle tone changes or minor details hinting at upcoming developments.

**Use Dialogue Effectively:**
A conversation that sparks revelation or hints at future conflict drives plot forward naturally.

**Mood Continuity:**
If scenes carry similar emotional weight, transitions feel more natural.

**Avoid Over-Explaining:**
Let readers infer changes. Show, don't tell. Effective transitions whisper and invite the reader to follow.

### Good vs Bad

Bad (Cop-Out):
> Chapter end: "Three steps in, the floorboard creaked. 'Braaiinssss,' a zombie moaned."
> Next chapter: "Jane was still mad at Bob for jumping out at her the night before."

Cheats readers out of the payoff. Let scenes play out.

Good (Increasing Quality):

1. "Jane crossed the room and entered the bathroom." (functional but boring)
2. "Jane found the bathroom behind a ripped curtain someone had nailed up to replace the missing door." (adds detail)
3. "Jane pulled her nine mil and crept toward what looked like the bathroom. Probably no one there, but why take chances." (adds tension and character)

## Scene Breaks

### What Are Scene Breaks?

White spaces or typographical symbols indicating a shift within a chapter. More subtle than chapter breaks but serving similar purposes.

**Scene break:** Brief dimming of lights (like in a stage play)
**Chapter break:** Drawing the curtain so stagehands can switch sets

### When to Use Scene Breaks

**Time Changes:**
Small time shifts—morning to evening, skipping ahead a few days. Most common use.

**Location Changes:**
Significant shifts in setting. Only necessary if the jump feels jarring.

**POV Changes:**
Always use a passage break when changing narrator or POV character.

**Flashbacks and Dreams:**
Use scene breaks to signpost flashbacks, differentiating present from past.

**Participant Structure Changes:**
Major change in which characters are present, dramatic revelation, sudden appearance of important character.

**Building Tension:**
Cut right before revealing something important. Hero about to open door to murder scene—break as they turn the handle.

### How to Format Scene Breaks

**White Space:**
Skip one or two lines between passages. Often enough of a visual cue.

**Dinkus (Symbols):**

- Three asterisks centered (\*\*\*)
- Three hashmarks (###)
- Dash with hashmark (-#-)

**The Rule:**
You MUST give readers some visual cue that the scene has changed. Don't stop and jump ahead without warning.

### Best Practices

**The Movie Test:**
Imagine where the director would cut or fade to black. Scene changes in prose work similarly.

**Avoid Over-Breaking:**
Don't break every time you hit a good hook line—feels choppy. Each scene should have closure before leaving.

**Good Scene Breaks:**
Should make the reader think "ooooh" and keep reading. Serves a purpose and adds to overarching narrative.

## Interactive Fiction Considerations

### Modular Scene Construction

Each scene segment needs clear entry and exit points for various narrative paths. Scenes must function coherently regardless of how readers arrive.

### Branch Transitions

**Acknowledge Player Choices:**
Create connecting text that acknowledges previous choices while introducing new scenarios.

**Continuity Across Branches:**
Even when story takes dramatic turns, transitions should feel natural. Characters must react consistently with established personalities.

## Quick Reference

| Transition Type | When to Use | Technique |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Time skip | Boring parts | Cut directly, summary paragraph |
| Flashback | Essential backstory only | Tense shift, formatting cues |
| Location change | New setting | Arrive late, sensory grounding |
| Scene break | Time/location/POV shift | White space or dinkus |
| Bridging | Smooth flow | Mirror imagery between scenes |
| Seamless | Always | Emotional echoes, avoid over-explaining |
