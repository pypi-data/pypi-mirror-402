# Character Voice

Craft guidance for creating distinct character voices through idiolect, POV consistency, and vocabulary choices.

---

## Idiolects

### What Is Idiolect?

A person's idiolect is their particular, personal language pattern—like a linguistic fingerprint. It's shaped by personality, age, job, origin, and life experience. Every character should have one.

### Verbal Signatures

Give each character verbal elements that instantly identify them:

**Repeated Phrases:**
Gatsby's "old sport" appears over 40 times in *The Great Gatsby*, revealing his constructed identity and desire to appear as old money.

**Vocal Mannerisms:**

- Clearing throat frequently
- Stuttering under stress
- Filler words ("um," "like," "you know")
- Trailing off mid-sentence

**Unique Word Choices:**

- Blunt vs elaborate language
- Positive vs negative framing
- Literal vs metaphorical thinking
- Complete vs fragmented sentences

### The Author Voice Problem

The most common mistake: all characters sound like the author. Every character asks questions the same way, reacts to trouble the same way, greets others the same way.

If you removed all dialogue tags, could you tell who's speaking? If not, you have an author voice problem.

### Good vs Bad Example

Bad (All Sound the Same):
> "Hello, how are you today?" asked John.
> "I'm fine, thank you. How are you?" replied Sarah.
> "I'm doing well, thanks for asking," said Tom.

Good (Distinct Voices):
> "Yo, what's up?" John nodded.
> Sarah cleared her throat. "Good afternoon. Lovely weather we're having."
> "Oh, you know, can't complain. Well, I could, but..." Tom trailed off with a shrug.

## POV Consistency

### The Cardinal Rule

Limit yourself to one perspective character per scene. Preferably per chapter. Readers need to know where to situate their consciousness within the novel.

### Deep POV

Deep POV removes psychic distance between reader and character. Instead of the narrator interpreting events, readers experience the story AS the character—through their eyes and physical experience.

### Eliminating Filter Words

Filter words distance readers and remind them they're reading. Common filters: see, hear, notice, feel, knew, wondered, thought.

Bad (With Filters):
> He heard the cry of a newborn.
> She saw a car veer onto the sidewalk.
> She wondered if it would hurt.

Good (Deep POV):
> A newborn's cry shattered the sanctuary's hush.
> A car veered onto the sidewalk.
> Would it hurt?

### Head-Hopping

Head-hopping jumps from one character's POV to another within a scene without transition.

Bad:
> Charlie gripped the steering wheel, evaluating the track ahead. He'd have to overcome his terrible starting position. Lucy, at the head of the pack, chuckled to herself: she was poised to win!

We've jumped from Charlie's thoughts to Lucy's internal state.

Good:
> Charlie gripped the steering wheel. He'd have to overcome his terrible starting position. Up ahead, Lucy's shoulders shook—was she laughing at him?

Now we only see Lucy through Charlie's external observation.

### Common POV Violations

Bad: "The irony escaped Anna." (Anna can't notice what she doesn't notice)

Bad: "Anna's expression turned cold." (Anna can't see her own face)

Bad: "Lisa eyed Anna, looking for signs of a lie." (Anna can't know why Lisa is staring)

Good:
> Anna didn't catch the irony.
> Anna felt her jaw tighten, her teeth grinding.
> Lisa stared at her, eyes narrowed. Searching for something?

## Voice vs Dialogue

### Three Ways to Create Character Voice

1. **Narrative voice** - The words a narrator uses in description
2. **Written dialogue** - How characters speak
3. **Other characters' descriptions** - How others describe someone's voice

A character's voice should permeate all three, not just dialogue.

### Free Indirect Discourse

Free indirect discourse writes a character's first-person thoughts in the third-person narrator's voice. It blurs the line between narrator commentary and internal monologue.

Example:
> She stared at the letter. What was she supposed to do with this? As if she didn't have enough problems already.

The second and third sentences are the character's thoughts, delivered without quotation marks or "she thought."

### The Uncle Charles Principle

From James Joyce: narrative style shifts to fit the language of the focal character. The narration is like a chameleon, shifting tone, diction, and syntax to match whoever's perspective we're in.

### Internal Monologue Formatting

**The One Real Rule:** Don't use quotation marks for internal dialogue. Reserve those for spoken words. Some writers use italics for direct internal thought.

Bad:
> Jason thought to himself, "I'm not interested in this conversation."

Good (Deep POV):
> Not interested.

Good (With Action):
> Jason peered out the window. Were they coming for him? Distant hoofbeats echoed.

## Character-Specific Vocabulary

### Diction Levels

**High/Formal** - Professional, academic, strict grammar
**Middle/Neutral** - Neither formal nor informal
**Low/Informal** - Casual, slang, colloquial

### Education Level Indicators

**Well-Educated Characters:**
Use large words and small ones together naturally—equally at ease with all vocabulary.

**Characters Projecting Intelligence:**
Use many large words in a row (intentionally projecting an image). May come across as insecure or pretentious.

**Less Formal Education:**
Can still show intelligence and curiosity through other means. Vocabulary reflects background, not worth.

### Regional and Professional Language

**Regional Elements:**

- Slang and idioms
- Regional sayings and proverbs
- Unusual phrasing ("wee" for small in Scottish)

**Professional Vocabulary:**
A lawyer speaks differently than a mechanic, a doctor differently than a bartender. Profession shapes not just vocabulary but metaphors and reference points.

### Dialect Best Practices

**Less Is More.** Heavy phonetic spelling frustrates readers.

Bad (Overuse):
> "Ah wuz jes' thinkin' 'bout how ye'd be comin' 'round t'see me."

This is hard to parse and risks stereotyping.

**Better Approach:**
Use word choice and syntax rather than phonetic spelling. Choose one or two defining pronunciations and use them consistently.

In Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck captures Depression-era California speech through clipped sentences, dropped consonants ("an'," "outa"), and rural slang—without heavy nonstandard spelling.

## Sentence Rhythm and Personality

### Short, Clipped Sentences

Suggest no-nonsense, business-like characters. Also works for anxious or focused mental states.

> She checked the window. Clear. The door. Locked. Time to move.

### Long, Meandering Sentences

Suggest chaotic, dreamy, or contemplative characters. Stream of consciousness.

> She stood at the window watching the rain trace patterns on the glass, remembering how her mother used to call them "sky tears" and wondering if somewhere, somehow, her mother was watching too.

### Mixed Rhythm

Strings of long words sound more formal. Basic vocabulary strikes readers as intimate and down-to-earth. Vary to match mood.

## Voice in Interactive Fiction

### Maintaining Voice Across Branches

In branching narratives, character voice must remain consistent regardless of which path the player takes.

**Challenges:**

- Different authors may write different branches
- Time between writing sessions creates voice drift
- Player choices may put characters in unfamiliar situations

**Solutions:**

- Create voice sheets with example sentences for each character
- Include forbidden phrases (what this character would never say)
- Write sample dialogue for high-stress and low-stress situations
- Review branches side-by-side for consistency

### Voice Under Player Pressure

Players may force characters into situations that test their voice:

**The stress test:** How does this character sound when threatened?

- Does vocabulary simplify or complexify?
- Do sentences shorten or fragment?
- Do verbal tics increase or disappear?

**The intimacy test:** How does this character sound when emotionally exposed?

- More or less formal?
- More or less direct?
- What defenses emerge in speech?

**The deception test:** How does this character sound when lying?

- Overexplanation?
- Unusual word choices?
- Body language contradicting speech?

### Player Character Voice

In second-person IF, the "you" protagonist presents unique challenges:

**Options:**

1. **Blank slate:** Minimal characterization—player projects themselves
2. **Defined character:** Strong voice—player inhabits a specific person
3. **Hybrid:** Light characterization with player-shaped specifics

Each approach requires different consistency rules. A blank slate protagonist should have minimal verbal tics; a defined character needs consistent voice regardless of player choices.

## Testing Your Voices

### The Cover Test

While reading your draft, cover character names above dialogue. If you can't tell who's speaking, there's a problem.

Each character should have identifiable patterns in:

- Vocabulary choices
- Sentence length and rhythm
- Formality level
- Response patterns

### Accept Limitations

You may have 3-4 core "voices" in you. Differentiate further through content, concerns, and other character dimensions rather than trying to create infinite distinct speech patterns.

## Quick Reference

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Idiolect | Unique speech fingerprint |
| Verbal tics | Quick character identification |
| Deep POV | Eliminates reader distance |
| Filter words | Cut them for immediacy |
| Free indirect | Thoughts without "she thought" |
| Diction level | Shows background/education |
| Dialect | Sparingly, through syntax not spelling |
| Rhythm | Matches personality and mood |

## Research Basis

Sources on character voice and POV:

| Concept | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Idiolect in fiction | David Crystal, *The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language* (1987) |
| Deep POV | Marcy Kennedy, *Deep Point of View* (2015); Jill Elizabeth Nelson, *Rivet Your Readers with Deep Point of View* (2012) |
| Uncle Charles Principle | Hugh Kenner, *Joyce's Voices* (1978), analyzing James Joyce |
| Free indirect discourse | Monika Fludernik, *The Fictions of Language and the Languages of Fiction* (1993) |
| Dialect in fiction | June Casagrande, *The Best Punctuation Book, Period* (2014); various articles on avoiding stereotyping |

The Uncle Charles Principle—named for Joyce's character—describes how third-person narration can absorb the vocabulary and sensibility of the focal character without explicitly marking it as thought or speech.
