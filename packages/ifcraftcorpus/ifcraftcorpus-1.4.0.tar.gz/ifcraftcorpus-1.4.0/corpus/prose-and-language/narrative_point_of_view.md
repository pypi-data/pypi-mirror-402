# Narrative Point of View in Interactive Fiction

How to choose and maintain point of view (POV) in interactive fiction—camera position, pronoun choice, psychic distance, and when (and how) to shift POV without confusing or betraying the player.

POV decisions affect:

- How close the reader feels to characters.
- How much the player feels like **the** protagonist vs **controlling** one.
- What information can be known or hidden.
- How natural choices and prompts feel.

## Core POV Options

Most IF uses one of three broad POV families:

- **First person** – “I stepped into the alley.”
- **Second person** – “You step into the alley.”
- **Third person** – “She steps into the alley.”

### First Person

**Strengths**

- Strong character interiority—thoughts and emotions can flow naturally.
- Easy to express bias and unreliable narration.
- Works well for confession, journals, and introspective stories.

**Risks in IF**

- Player may feel more like an **advisor** than the “I” speaking.
- Choices can clash with the established personality if not carefully framed.
- Multiple first-person POVs can be disorienting without clear labeling.

**Usage Patterns**

- Great for:
  - Strong-voice protagonists.
  - Confessional or diary structures.
  - Stories where unreliability is central.
- Less ideal for:
  - Highly customizable protagonists with many player-defined traits.
  - Very large casts with frequent POV shifts.

### Second Person

The traditional default in parser IF and common in many choice-based games.

**Strengths**

- Directly addresses the player: high sense of agency.
- Aligns UI and narration (“You type X” / “You choose Y”).
- Makes prompts for choice selection feel natural.

**Risks**

- Can create friction when the text asserts feelings or history that the player does not endorse.
- “You” can be ambiguous—player, protagonist, both?

**Good Second-Person Practice**

- Be specific about **who “you” are**:
  - Establish key facts early: age, role, world position.
  - Decide whether “you” is a blank slate or a defined character.
- Be careful asserting internal states:
  - Prefer observable reactions: “Your hands shake” vs “You are terrified.”
  - Let choices express interiority: offer emotional and cognitive options.

### Third Person

**Strengths**

- Flexible camera: can zoom in and out, follow different characters.
- Easier to handle multiple POV characters.
- Less direct conflict between player and protagonist identity.

**Risks**

- Can feel more distant in IF if not balanced with strong interior access.
- Tooling/UI that speaks directly to the player (“Choose…”, “You can…”) may clash with a distant narrator.

**Common Choices**

- **Third-person limited**: tied closely to one character’s perceptions.
- **Third-person omniscient**: narrator may reveal anything, including other minds and hidden facts.

In IF, **third-person limited** is generally safer; omniscient narration can accidentally spoil tension if it over-explains.

## Psychic Distance (Camera Distance)

Beyond pronoun choice, **psychic distance** controls how “close” the narration sits to the character’s mind.

Roughly:

1. Very far: “It was a cold autumn morning; the city prepared for another day.”
2. Far: “Lena walked through the chilly streets, unseen by the crowds.”
3. Middle: “Lena hunched deeper into her coat, wishing she’d left earlier.”
4. Close: “She was late again. Of course. Why did she always do this?”
5. Very close / deep POV: “Late again. Brilliant. Maybe if I sprint I can pretend I meant to be.”

Key ideas:

- **Closer distance** → more direct access to thoughts, emotions, and voice.
- **Farther distance** → more summary, world overview, and authorial commentary.

In IF:

- Deep POV pairs well with **character-driven choice design** (“Do you apologize?”).
- Slightly more distant POV can help when:
  - Exposition about systems or mechanics is needed.
  - You’re foreshadowing or hinting at facts the character doesn’t fully realize.

Consistency matters more than the exact level. Sudden unmotivated jumps between far and deep can feel like POV breaks.

## POV Consistency and Head-Hopping

### Head-Hopping Defined

“Head-hopping” is an abrupt, unmarked switch of viewpoint inside a scene—jumping from one character’s internal thoughts to another’s without clear transition.

Example:

> Lena hated this alley; it always smelled like rot. She wondered if she’d made a mistake coming alone.  
>  
> Marcus watched her approach, both excited and afraid she’d see the knife hidden in his sleeve.

Both internal states appear in one continuous moment without transition; the camera leaps from inside Lena to inside Marcus.

In linear fiction this is usually considered sloppy; in IF it’s even more confusing, because:

- The player needs to know **whose choices** they are making.
- Sudden POV shifts can feel like losing control or context.

### Rules of Thumb

- **One POV per scene/section** unless there is a clear structural marker:
  - New chapter, labeled section, or explicit POV tag.
  - Visual separator plus a clear re-introduction of the new POV.
- When shifting POV:
  - Anchor the new viewpoint quickly (“As Marcus watched from the rooftop…”).
  - Re-orient the player to where they are, what they know, and what they can do.

### IF-Specific Head-Hopping Hazards

- Having both narration and UI speak as different entities:
  - Narration: “You draw your sword.”  
  - Choice UI: “Have the hero flee” / “Have the hero fight.”
- In multiplayer or party-POV IF, be explicit:
  - “You now control Maia.”
  - “Next, we shift to the detective’s POV.”

## Multi-POV Structures in IF

Many interactive stories benefit from **multiple POV characters**—especially mysteries, epics, and ensemble cast stories.

### Common Multi-POV Patterns

1. **Alternating Chapters**
   - Each chapter/episode is told from a different character’s viewpoint.
   - Clear labeling: “Chapter 3: Noor” or “Day 2 – The Detective.”
2. **Hub Character Plus Satellites**
   - Most content is from a main POV; occasional sections switch to other characters for contrast.
3. **Scenario-Based POV**
   - Different branches follow different POVs based on player choices (e.g., protagonist A vs protagonist B route).

### Design Considerations

- **Player Orientation**
  - Always remind the player whose POV they’re in at the start of a section.
  - Adjust the available choices to match what that character can actually do or know.
- **Information Structure**
  - Use different POVs to control who knows what, when.
  - Be careful not to spoil mystery routes by giving omniscient or overlapping POVs too much information too early.
- **Save/Load and Recaps**
  - With multiple POVs, players may come back after a break and forget who they are.
  - Short recap paragraphs can restate “who you are, where you are, what you’re aiming for.”

## POV and Player Agency

The relationship between **narrator POV** and **player agency** is central to IF design.

### Defined Protagonist vs Player Avatar

Two extremes:

- **Defined protagonist**
  - The character has backstory, voice, and strong preferences.
  - POV usually deep first person or second person with strong characterization.
  - Choices are about how they express themselves within that frame.
- **Player avatar**
  - The character is intentionally thin; the player’s identity and preferences fill the gaps.
  - POV may still be second person, but the narration avoids strong claims about interior life.

Most IF sits somewhere in the middle. Decide explicitly where your project lies and let POV reflect that.

### POV and Choice Wording

Align the **POV voice** and the **choice UI**:

- In second person:
  - Narration: “You stand at the fork in the road.”  
  - Choices: “Take the forest path” / “Take the cliffside road.”
- In third person:
  - Narration: “Kira stands at the fork in the road.”  
  - Choices: “Have Kira take the forest path” / “Have Kira take the cliffside road.”

Mixing styles leads to subtle friction.

### POV and Internal Choices

Choices can address **internal** decisions (thoughts, feelings) as well as external actions:

- “Admit to yourself that you’re afraid.”
- “Decide that the mission matters more than your safety.”

Deep POV supports these internal choices more naturally; distant POV may require more explicit narration of internal states.

## IF-Specific POV Pitfalls

Common failure modes:

- **POV Lie**
  - The narrator presents something as objective fact, then later contradicts it without clear unreliability framing.
- **Knowledge Leaks**
  - Limited POV reveals information the character couldn’t know (secret conversations elsewhere, private thoughts of others).
- **UI / Narration Clash**
  - Menu text or choice descriptions use a different voice or POV than the main narration (“I punch him” choices under a third-person narrator).
- **Abrupt Persona Shifts**
  - The text suddenly injects slang, jokes, or tonal shifts that don’t match the established narrator.

Strategies to avoid these:

- Maintain a short **POV bible**: pronouns, distance level, tone, knowledge limits.
- Audit scenes for “omniscient slips”: anything the current POV character shouldn’t perceive.
- Keep choice phrasing consistent with the narrative voice.

## Where This Doc Fits in the Corpus

This POV guidance connects to several other craft concerns:

- **Prose and Voice**
  - POV is a major component of narrative voice; it interacts with diction, rhythm, and sentence patterns.
- **Structure**
  - Multi-POV and POV shifts are structural tools for pacing, mystery construction, and thematic contrast.
- **Accessibility and Clarity**
  - Clear POV helps readers understand who they are, what they know, and what they can affect.
