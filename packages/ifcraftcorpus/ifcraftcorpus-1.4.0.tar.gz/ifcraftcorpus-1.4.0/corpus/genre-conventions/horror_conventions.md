# Horror Genre Conventions for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing horror—fear mechanics, atmosphere, threat design, pacing, and content considerations.

---

## Horror Subgenres

### Psychological Horror

**Core Conventions:**

- Fear comes from within the character's mind
- Reality becomes uncertain
- Paranoia, obsession, deteriorating mental state
- Readers question what's real
- Minimal or ambiguous supernatural elements
- The monster may be the protagonist themselves

**Techniques:**

- Unreliable narration
- Gaslighting and manipulation
- Dreams bleeding into reality
- Isolation amplifying internal fears

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Player choices may be unreliable
- Multiple "true" interpretations possible
- Sanity mechanics tracking mental state
- Same scene plays differently based on psychological state

### Supernatural Horror

**Core Conventions:**

- Ghosts, demons, curses, hauntings
- Rules for the supernatural (even if mysterious)
- Often tied to place, object, or unfinished business
- Possibility of defeating or appeasing the threat
- Violation of natural order creates dread

**Types:**

- Ghost stories (spirits with unfinished business)
- Demonic (malevolent entities from elsewhere)
- Cursed objects (items carrying evil)
- Haunted places (locations with dark history)

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Investigation of supernatural rules
- Rituals and countermeasures as mechanics
- Location-based horror with exploration
- Choices about confronting vs fleeing

### Cosmic Horror (Lovecraftian)

**Core Conventions:**

- Universe is indifferent or hostile to humanity
- Knowledge itself is dangerous
- Entities beyond human comprehension
- Madness as inevitable consequence of understanding
- Human insignificance in vast cosmos
- No true victory possible—only survival or delay

**Techniques:**

- Describing the indescribable
- Forbidden knowledge with costs
- Scale that dwarfs human concerns
- Protagonists who wish they didn't know

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Knowledge/sanity tradeoffs
- Investigation that hurts the investigator
- No "good" endings—only less bad ones
- Accepting mystery vs pursuing truth

### Body Horror

**Core Conventions:**

- Violation of physical form
- Transformation, mutation, infestation
- Loss of bodily autonomy
- Visceral, physical disgust
- Often metaphors for disease, aging, identity

**Techniques:**

- Detailed physical description
- Slow transformation over time
- Loss of control over one's own body
- Familiar made grotesque

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Transformation mechanics
- Choices with physical consequences
- Body as resource or liability
- Identity questions as body changes

### Gothic Horror

**Core Conventions:**

- Atmosphere of decay and gloom
- Ancestral curses and family secrets
- Crumbling castles, manor houses, isolated settings
- Romance intertwined with terror
- The past haunting the present
- Transgression and punishment

**Setting Elements:**

- Fog, shadows, candlelight
- Old architecture with hidden passages
- Portraits watching, rooms sealed for generations
- Graveyards, crypts, cellars

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Exploration of layered spaces
- Uncovering family secrets
- Past choices affecting present
- Romance and horror intertwined

### Survival Horror

**Core Conventions:**

- Resource scarcity creates tension
- Fight or flight decisions
- Vulnerable protagonist
- Safe spaces that may not stay safe
- Inventory management as gameplay
- Death as real possibility

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Resource tracking (health, items, sanity)
- Strategic retreat as valid choice
- Save points and checkpoints
- Multiple death states with different causes

## Fear Mechanics

### Dread vs Shock

**Dread (Sustained Fear):**

- Building anticipation of something bad
- Knowing something is coming
- The walk down the dark hallway
- More effective for sustained engagement

**Shock (Jump Scares):**

- Sudden revelation or attack
- Immediate startle response
- Brief but intense
- Diminishing returns if overused

**Balance:** Use dread to build tension, shock to release it. Too much shock numbs; too much dread exhausts.

### The Unseen vs The Revealed

**The Unseen:**

- Imagination fills in worst possibilities
- Sound, shadow, implication
- What's behind the door
- Often more terrifying than revelation

**The Revealed:**

- Confirmation of threat
- Allows direct confrontation
- Can disappoint if execution weak
- Necessary eventually for resolution

**Technique:** Delay revelation as long as tension serves the story. When revealing, show less than expected—leave room for imagination.

### The Rule of Less

What you don't show is often scarier than what you show.

- Sound of footsteps, not the creature making them
- Blood trail, not the violence that caused it
- Aftermath, not the event
- Reaction shots, not the horror itself

### Fear Through Identification

Horror works when readers fear FOR the character. Build sympathy first, then threaten what readers care about.

- Establish character's hopes and relationships
- Show vulnerability
- Make character's fears relatable
- Threaten what character loves

---

## Atmosphere and Setting

### Creating Dread Through Setting

**Isolation:**

- Geographic (remote cabin, island, space station)
- Social (no one believes protagonist)
- Communication (phones don't work, no signal)
- Temporal (night, storm, locked in)

**Wrongness:**

- Things slightly off
- Uncanny valley effects
- Familiar made strange
- Rules that don't quite work

**Decay:**

- Physical deterioration
- Abandoned spaces
- Things falling apart
- Time's destructive passage

### Sensory Horror

**Sound:**

- Silence that shouldn't exist
- Sounds that shouldn't be there
- Familiar sounds in wrong contexts
- Things that shouldn't make noise

**Smell:**

- Decay, rot, copper of blood
- Wrong smells (flowers in winter, perfume of the dead)
- Absence of expected smells

**Touch:**

- Temperature (cold spots, unnatural warmth)
- Texture (wet, sticky, crawling)
- Air movement (breath on neck)
- Physical contact from unseen source

**Sight:**

- Darkness and what it hides
- Movement in periphery
- Things that shouldn't be visible
- Light behaving wrongly

### Safe Spaces

Even horror needs respite. Safe spaces:

- Allow readers to process
- Make danger feel dangerous by contrast
- Can be violated for maximum impact
- Should feel earned after danger

---

## Threat Design

### Human Threats

**Advantages:**

- Immediately understandable
- Relatable motivations
- No explanation needed
- Real-world plausibility

**Types:**

- Serial killers
- Cults
- Corrupt authorities
- Family members
- The protagonist themselves

### Supernatural Threats

**Advantages:**

- Can violate natural law
- Mystery adds fear
- Symbolism and metaphor
- Can be defeated through special means

**Requirements:**

- Internal consistency
- Rules (even if hidden)
- Weakness or limit
- Clear enough to fear properly

### Cosmic Threats

**Advantages:**

- Unlimited scale and power
- Cannot be understood
- Victory impossible—only survival
- Existential dread

**Challenges:**

- Hard to depict directly
- Can feel arbitrary
- Must maintain stakes despite hopelessness

### Ambiguous Threats

**Advantages:**

- Imagination fills gaps
- Multiple interpretations valid
- Uncertainty is itself frightening
- Resists easy resolution

**Challenges:**

- Can frustrate readers wanting answers
- Must commit eventually (or commit to ambiguity)

## Pacing for Horror

### The Tension Curve

Horror needs rhythm: build tension, partial release, build higher, release.

**Pattern:**

1. Establish normalcy
2. First hint of wrongness
3. Investigation/escalation
4. False resolution
5. Major revelation/confrontation
6. Climax
7. Resolution (often ambiguous)

### Quiet Moments

Essential for horror to work:

- Allow processing of fear
- Make loud moments louder by contrast
- Develop character under pressure
- Build toward next scare

**Don't:** Make every scene maximally scary. Readers become numb.

### Escalation

Each encounter should raise stakes:

- First: hints and suggestions
- Second: direct evidence
- Third: close call
- Fourth: real consequences
- Climax: full confrontation

### Release and Rebuild

After major scares:

- Allow brief safety
- Characters process what happened
- Then: new threat or escalation
- Safety itself becomes uncertain

## Content Considerations

### Content Warnings

Horror often contains disturbing material. Best practices:

**Be Specific:**

- "Contains graphic violence" not just "mature content"
- "Includes depictions of self-harm"
- "Contains body horror and gore"

**Be Upfront:**

- Before reader commits significant time
- At beginning, not buried in menus

**Non-Spoilery:**

- Warn about presence, not details
- "Contains major character death" not "Character X dies"

### What Requires Warning

Common triggers to consider:

- Graphic violence and gore
- Sexual violence
- Self-harm and suicide
- Child endangerment
- Animal harm
- Specific phobias (spiders, needles, etc.)
- Psychological abuse
- Body horror

### Responsible Horror

Horror can explore dark themes responsibly:

- Purpose beyond shock
- Not gratuitous—serves story
- Consequences shown
- Not exploitative of real trauma
- Offers something beyond nihilism

---

## Interactive Horror Considerations

### Player Vulnerability

Horror works when players feel vulnerable:

- Limited resources
- Imperfect information
- Consequences for failure
- Inability to save everyone
- Time pressure

### Choice Under Fear

Horror choices should feel pressured:

- Not enough time to think
- No clearly good options
- Information incomplete
- Consequences unclear

### Agency and Helplessness

**Balance needed:**

- Too much agency removes fear
- Too little frustrates players
- Sweet spot: agency that doesn't guarantee safety

### Death States

In horror IF:

- Death should feel possible
- But not cheap or random
- Warn through atmosphere
- Give players chance to avoid
- Make deaths meaningful, not frustrating

### Branching in Horror

**Considerations:**

- Multiple endings (survival, death, corruption)
- Choices affecting who survives
- Investigation depth affecting understanding
- Moral choices about sacrifice
- Knowledge that comes at cost

### Sanity/Corruption Mechanics

Common in horror IF:

- Track mental state
- Choices affect corruption
- Sanity affects perception
- Low sanity changes available options
- Multiple "failure" states beyond death

## Common Mistakes

### Jump Scare Dependency

Over-relying on sudden scares. Diminishing returns make each scare less effective.

**Fix:** Build sustained dread. Use shock sparingly for release.

### Explaining Too Much

Horror often diminishes when fully explained. Mystery feeds fear.

**Fix:** Leave some questions unanswered. Imply rather than state.

### Invincible Protagonist

If protagonist never truly threatened, tension evaporates.

**Fix:** Show real consequences. Kill supporting characters. Injure protagonist.

### Gratuitous Content

Violence and horror without purpose numbs rather than frightens.

**Fix:** Every disturbing element should serve the story.

### Predictable Patterns

If readers know when scares come, anticipation replaces fear.

**Fix:** Vary timing. Subvert expected patterns.

### Tone Whiplash

Mixing horror with incompatible tones (broad comedy, romance) can undermine both.

**Fix:** Maintain tonal consistency. Comic relief should be brief and nervous.
