# Historical Fiction Conventions for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing historical fiction—research balance, period voice, handling historical figures, and avoiding anachronisms.

---

## Research and Accuracy

### The Research Balance

**The Challenge:**

Too much accuracy bogs down story. Too little accuracy breaks immersion. Find the balance where historical detail serves narrative.

**Guideline:** Research deeply, use sparingly. Know ten times more than you show.

### When Accuracy Matters

**Critical (Get Right):**

- Major historical events
- Technology that affects plot
- Social structures and laws
- Death and life of real figures
- Geography and distances

**Flexible (Can Adjust):**

- Exact dialogue of real people
- Minor timeline adjustments
- Composite characters
- Telescoping events for drama

**Minimal Importance:**

- Weather on specific days
- Exact menus and recipes
- Precise fashion details (unless plot-relevant)

### Research Sources

**Primary Sources:**

- Diaries, letters, newspapers from the period
- Government records and documents
- Contemporary accounts

**Secondary Sources:**

- Academic histories
- Biographies
- Period-specific encyclopedias

**Caution Sources:**

- Wikipedia (starting point only)
- Historical fiction (other authors' interpretations)
- Movies and TV (often inaccurate)

### The "Small Lies, Big Truth" Principle

You can change small details to serve story as long as you preserve the larger historical truth.

**Acceptable:**

> Moving a meeting from Tuesday to Thursday for dramatic timing.

**Not Acceptable:**

> Having the wrong side win a famous battle.

## Period Voice

### Dialogue Challenges

**The Problem:**

Authentic period dialogue can be unreadable. Modern dialogue breaks immersion.

**The Solution:**

Create the illusion of period speech without literal transcription.

### Techniques for Period Voice

**Vocabulary Selection:**

- Remove obvious anachronisms
- Use period-appropriate terms for technology
- Match formality to era and class
- Avoid modern slang and idioms

**Sentence Structure:**

- Slightly more formal than modern speech
- Period-appropriate contractions (or lack thereof)
- Address forms matching social relationships

**Rhythm and Flow:**

- More important than vocabulary
- Read period sources aloud to internalize rhythm
- Match speech patterns to era

### What to Avoid

**Archaic Overload:**

Bad:
> "Prithee, good sirrah, wouldst thou deign to inform mine humble personage of the hour?"

This is unreadable and often historically inaccurate.

Good:
> "What time is it?" (Even historical people asked simple questions simply)

**Modern Intrusions:**

Bad:
> "I'm totally stressed about the war."

Good:
> "This war weighs on me."

**Inconsistent Register:**

Bad:
> "Methinks we should check out that tavern."

Mixing archaic and modern reads as parody.

### Class and Education

Different characters speak differently:

- Educated upper class: more formal, longer sentences
- Working class: simpler vocabulary, regional patterns
- Servants to masters: deferential forms
- Friends among equals: relaxed versions of above

## Daily Life Details

### Why Details Matter

Period details create immersion. The reader should feel transported. Small authentic touches matter more than grand historical set pieces.

### Categories of Detail

**Domestic Life:**

- How people wake, eat, sleep
- Lighting and heating
- Clothing and dressing routines
- Food preparation and meals

**Social Interactions:**

- Greeting customs
- Forms of address
- Gender expectations
- Class interactions

**Work and Commerce:**

- How money works
- What jobs exist
- Trade and shopping
- Travel methods and times

**Technology:**

- What exists and what doesn't
- How things actually work
- Limitations and dangers
- Rate of adoption

### The Lived-In Test

**Ask:** Could my character describe their morning routine?

If you can't answer basic questions about daily life, research more.

### Common Era-Specific Considerations

**Medieval:**

- Limited mobility and communication
- Church as central authority
- Feudal obligations
- High mortality rates

**Victorian:**

- Rigid class structure
- Industrialization's impact
- Empire and colonialism
- Gender restrictions

**WWII:**

- Rationing and shortages
- Censorship and propaganda
- Home front vs combat
- Technology of war

**Regency:**

- Social season structure
- Marriage market
- Etiquette rules
- Limited female agency

## Handling Historical Prejudices

### The Challenge

Historical periods had views modern readers find abhorrent: racism, sexism, homophobia, religious persecution, colonialism.

### Approaches

**Acknowledge Without Endorsing:**

- Show prejudice existed
- Don't have characters approve
- Let readers see injustice
- Avoid making oppression "normal"

**Protagonist Perspective:**

- Protagonist can hold modern-ish values (rare but existing)
- Or can learn and grow
- Or can be complicit (darker narratives)
- Avoid protagonist lectures on modern values

**Marginalized Perspectives:**

- Consider whose story you're telling
- Research how affected groups actually lived
- Avoid trauma tourism
- Consult sensitivity readers

### What to Avoid

**Sanitizing:**

Pretending prejudice didn't exist. Breaks historical authenticity and erases real suffering.

**Gratuitous Depiction:**

Detailed portrayal of violence against marginalized groups without purpose.

**Modern Savior:**

Protagonist solving historical injustice with modern enlightenment.

**Anachronistic Attitudes:**

Characters with 21st-century progressive values in 1600s without explanation.

### Interactive Fiction Considerations

- Player choices around prejudice (participate, resist, avoid)
- Consequences reflecting historical reality
- Multiple perspective characters
- Content warnings for period-accurate content

## Real Historical Figures

### When to Include Them

Real figures add authenticity and interest. But they bring responsibilities.

**Good Uses:**

- Brief appearances establishing setting
- Known figures doing documented things
- Background characters (crowds, officials)

**Risky Uses:**

- Extended dialogue and scenes
- Private moments with no historical record
- Actions contradicting historical record

### Guidelines

**Respect the Record:**

- Don't contradict well-documented facts
- Can fill gaps in record with plausible fiction
- Mark clearly what's invented vs documented

**Death and Life:**

- Don't change when/how documented deaths occurred
- Don't resurrect the dead
- Be careful with causes of death if uncertain

**Character Assassination:**

- Don't depict historical figures negatively without evidence
- Particularly careful with descendants still living
- Libel concerns with recent figures

**Sympathy for Villains:**

- Can humanize without excusing
- Show complexity, not rehabilitation
- Don't make historical monsters misunderstood heroes

### Dialogue Attribution

When putting words in real people's mouths:

- Base on documented views and speech patterns
- Don't have them say things contrary to record
- Acknowledge in author's notes what's invented

---

## Common Anachronisms

### Vocabulary Anachronisms

Words that didn't exist or meant different things:

- "Okay" (19th century American)
- "Mob" (17th century, from Latin mobile vulgus)
- "Boyfriend/girlfriend" (early 20th century)
- "Stressed" (modern psychological sense)
- "Scientist" (1834)

**Research:** Check etymology of any word that feels modern.

### Technology Anachronisms

Using technology before invention:

- Matches before 1826
- Telegraphs before 1840s
- Anesthesia before 1846
- Photographs before 1820s
- Antibiotics before 1928

### Conceptual Anachronisms

Modern concepts applied to past:

- Modern psychology before Freud
- Evolution before Darwin
- Nationalism before 19th century
- Privacy expectations in communal societies
- Individual rights before Enlightenment

### Social Anachronisms

Modern social patterns in historical settings:

- Casual mixed-gender socializing in strict societies
- Class mobility in rigid hierarchies
- Women's independence before legal changes
- Racial integration before it occurred

### Food and Drink

Foods not yet available:

- Potatoes/tomatoes in Europe before 1500s
- Coffee/tea in Europe before trade routes
- Sugar before it became affordable
- Specific dishes before cultural exchange

## Interactive Fiction Considerations

### Player Choice vs Historical Constraint

**The Tension:**

History is fixed. Player agency requires choice. How to balance?

**Solutions:**

**Fictional Protagonist:**

- Real history happens around fictional character
- Player choices affect personal story, not major events
- History constrains options but doesn't eliminate them

**Alternate History:**

- Explicitly diverge from real history
- Player choices create alternate timeline
- Clear signals about historical divergence

**Micro vs Macro:**

- Macro history fixed (wars, rulers, technology)
- Micro history flexible (individual lives, personal outcomes)

### Consequences of Anachronistic Choices

If player can make ahistorical choices, show consequences:

- Social rejection for breaking norms
- Legal consequences for forbidden behavior
- Practical failures (technology that doesn't exist)

### Multiple Paths Through History

Different paths can show different aspects of period:

- Upper class vs lower class perspectives
- Different geographic locations
- Different professions
- Different marginalized experiences

### Research Burden

Historical IF requires more research than contemporary:

- Location descriptions must be period-accurate
- NPC dialogue must fit era
- Available choices constrained by period
- Consequences must reflect historical reality

---

## Common Mistakes

### Protagonist Knows Too Much

Character knows things they couldn't know:

- Future events
- Scientific discoveries not yet made
- Other countries' secrets
- Information not available to their class/gender

### Everyone Is Remarkably Modern

All sympathetic characters have 21st-century values. Feels false and breaks immersion.

### History Tourism

Using historical setting as backdrop without engaging with it. Characters could be in any era.

### Info Dumping Period Details

Stopping story to explain historical context. Integrate through action and dialogue.

### Inconsistent Level of Detail

Some aspects carefully researched, others clearly wrong. Inconsistency breaks trust.

### Assuming Universal Experience

Writing one class/gender/region as if universal. Medieval peasant life differs vastly from noble life.
