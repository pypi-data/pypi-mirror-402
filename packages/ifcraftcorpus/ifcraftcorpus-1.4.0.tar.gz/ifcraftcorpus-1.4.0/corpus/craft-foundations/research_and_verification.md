# Research and Verification for Creative Work

Craft guidance for assessing certainty, structuring research findings, and handling uncertain facts in fiction—from corroborated history to plausible invention.

---

## Why Research Posture Matters

Not all facts are equally certain. Fiction writers need to know:

- What they can state with confidence
- What requires hedging
- What sources conflict
- What has no backing at all

**Posture** captures this certainty level, enabling informed creative decisions.

---

## The Posture Framework

### Posture Levels

| Posture | Definition | Confidence |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Corroborated | Multiple reliable sources agree | High |
| Plausible | Reasonable based on available evidence | Medium |
| Disputed | Sources actively conflict | Variable |
| Uncorroborated | No sources found | Low |

### Corroborated

**Definition:** Multiple reliable sources agree on the claim.

**Indicators:**

- 2+ independent, reputable sources confirm
- Wikipedia plus one other source agree
- Academic or government sources confirm
- Multiple news sources report consistently

**Surface Treatment:** State directly without hedging.

**Example:**
> Victorian London began installing electric street lamps in 1878.

### Plausible

**Definition:** Reasonable to assume based on available evidence.

**Indicators:**

- One good source (encyclopedia, textbook)
- Logical extension of corroborated facts
- Expert opinion without contradiction

**Surface Treatment:** Soft hedge—"believed to be," "thought to have been."

**Example:**
> The practice was believed to have originated in the northern provinces.

### Disputed

**Definition:** Sources actively conflict; multiple valid interpretations exist.

**Indicators:**

- Sources actively disagree
- Historical debate ongoing
- Regional or cultural variation exists

**Surface Treatment:** Present as in-world disagreement rather than stating one version as fact.

**Example:**
> Historians disagree about what sparked the uprising. Some point to the grain shortage; others blame the governor's decree.

### Uncorroborated

**Definition:** No sources found to support the claim.

**Risk Levels:**

| Risk | Impact if Wrong | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Low | Flavor detail, no story impact | Color of tavern sign, background character name |
| Medium | Could cause plot inconsistency | How organization made decisions, character motivation basis |
| High | Could break the story | Central premise, safety-critical claims, medical/legal facts |

**Surface Treatment:** Use neutral phrasing; avoid definitive claims.

**Examples:**

- Low risk: "The old lighthouse had stood for as long as anyone could remember."
- Medium risk: "It was said the council met in secret, though no records survived."
- High risk: Requires research escalation—don't proceed with central premises unsupported.

## Research Memos

### Purpose

A research memo provides decision-ready information to creative workers without overwhelming them with raw data.

### Memo Structure

| Section | Content | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Question | Exact question being answered | 1 line |
| Short Answer | Decision-ready synthesis | 2-5 lines |
| Posture | Certainty classification | 1 word + justification |
| Citations | Sources consulted | 2-5 sources |
| Caveats | What's uncertain or context-dependent | Brief list |
| Creative Implications | Affordances and constraints | 2-4 items each |
| Neutral Phrasing | Player-safe wording options | 1-2 lines |
| Handoffs | Who else needs this information | Agent/role names |

### Example Research Memo

```
Question: Did Victorian London have electric street lights?

Short Answer: Yes, limited deployment from 1878. The Holborn Viaduct
installation was first. Most streets remained gas-lit through the 1880s.
Electric lighting spread unevenly—wealthy areas first.

Posture: Corroborated (Wikipedia + 2 historical archives agree)

Citations:
- Museum of London archives
- "London: A Social History" (Roy Porter)
- British History Online primary sources

Caveats:
- Exact dates vary by district
- Private vs public lighting differed
- Quality and reliability varied significantly

Creative Implications:
  Affordances:
  - Can use contrast between lit and dark districts
  - Class divisions visible through lighting
  - Flickering/unreliable power adds atmosphere

  Constraints:
  - Widespread electric lighting anachronistic before 1890s
  - Don't assume consistent illumination
  - Gas remained dominant for residential areas

Neutral Phrasing:
"The occasional hum of electric lamps marked the newer districts,
though most streets still flickered with gaslight."

## Research Principles

### Answer Narrowly

**Problem:** Researchers dump everything they found.

**Fix:** Answer the specific question asked. Provide decision-ready synthesis, not Wikipedia summaries.

**Target:** 2-5 lines for short answer, 2-5 citations maximum.

### Preserve Creative Context

Research should support creative work, not derail it.

**Good:** "Here's what you need to know for this scene."

**Bad:** "Here's everything about Victorian street lighting, including manufacturing processes, political debates, and economic analysis."

### Report Constraints, Not Decisions

Research identifies what the world allows or forbids. Creative decisions belong to other roles.

**Good:** "Electric lighting existed in wealthy districts by 1880."

**Bad:** "You should set the scene on the Holborn Viaduct to use electric lighting."

### Never Surface Sources

Players should never see research artifacts.

**Never on player-facing surfaces:**

- "According to Wikipedia..."
- "Sources indicate..."
- "Historians believe..."
- Citation markers or footnotes

**Instead:** Integrate facts naturally into narrative.

## Handling Research Gaps

### When You Can't Find Sources

1. **Assess risk level** — How bad if wrong?
2. **Document the gap** — What exactly is unknown?
3. **Escalate if high-risk** — Central premises need resolution
4. **Provide neutral phrasing** — For low-risk gaps

### Gap Documentation

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Question | What was asked |
| Search performed | What sources checked |
| Gap identified | What couldn't be found |
| Risk assessment | Low/Medium/High |
| Recommendation | Proceed cautiously / Escalate / Block |

### Creative Options for Gaps

| Risk | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Low | Proceed with neutral phrasing |
| Medium | Flag as provisional, note in canon |
| High | Escalate—don't proceed without resolution |

## Surface Treatment by Posture

How to phrase facts based on certainty:

### Corroborated (State Directly)

> The factory opened in 1847.
> The guild controlled the waterfront trade.
> Three bridges crossed the river.

### Plausible (Soft Hedge)

> The practice was believed to date back centuries.
> By most accounts, the family had lived there for generations.
> The traditional explanation held that...

### Disputed (Present Disagreement)

> Some said the fire was accidental; others suspected arson.
> Historians disagreed about the colony's founding date.
> The truth, as with many things, depended on who you asked.

### Uncorroborated (Neutral Phrasing)

> No one knew for certain how the tradition began.
> The origins were lost to time.
> Whether by accident or design, the record was silent.

## Common Research Mistakes

### Over-Researching

**Problem:** Spending hours on details that don't affect the story.

**Fix:** Research what matters for the scene. Background details can be plausible without being verified.

### Under-Researching

**Problem:** Getting central facts wrong, breaking reader trust.

**Fix:** Verify anything readers might know or check. Historical dates, famous events, technical processes.

### Treating Fiction as Source

**Problem:** Using other novels or movies as factual reference.

**Fix:** Fiction is inspiration, not evidence. Verify against primary or academic sources.

### Assuming Universal Knowledge

**Problem:** What's common knowledge varies by reader.

**Fix:** Consider your audience. Technical readers catch technical errors.

### Displaying Research

**Problem:** Showing off research instead of serving the story.

**Fix:** Use research to write confidently, not to demonstrate expertise.

## Quick Reference

| Posture | Definition | Surface Treatment |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Corroborated | Multiple sources agree | State directly |
| Plausible | One good source or logical extension | Soft hedge |
| Disputed | Sources conflict | Present as disagreement |
| Uncorroborated | No sources | Neutral phrasing, assess risk |

| Risk Level | Impact | Action |
