# Prose Patterns for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing compelling prose in interactive fiction—focusing on immediacy, sensory grounding, and rhythm.

---

## Second Person Present Tense

### Why Interactive Fiction Uses "You Walk"

Interactive fiction traditionally uses second person ("you") present tense ("walk") to create the illusion that the player IS the protagonist. This combination amplifies immediacy and makes events feel like they're happening in real-time.

Second person gives readers the impression they actually ARE the character, not merely observing them. Present tense keeps actions active and urgent. Together, they create maximum intimacy—the reader becomes a participant rather than an observer.

### Techniques for Immediacy

**Direct Address with Present Action:**

Good:
> You step into the dimly lit room. The floorboards creak underfoot. Somewhere above, pages rustle—though you see no one.

Bad:
> You stepped into the room. It was dimly lit. The floorboards creaked.

**Layer Sensory Details in Present Action:**

Good:
> You grip the cold metal handle. It turns with a rusty groan.

Bad:
> You gripped the handle. It was cold and turned with difficulty.

### Common Mistakes

**Breaking Immediacy:** Don't slip into past tense mid-scene. Avoid distancing phrases like "You remember that..." unless intentional for flashbacks.

**Sacrificing Clarity:** Ground the "you" character with enough context so players understand who, what, and why they are there. Don't sacrifice clarity for atmospheric tone—dream-like prose can leave readers lost.

**Over-Explaining:** Trust that readers understand they're the protagonist. Don't constantly remind them of their role.

## Sensory Grounding

### The 2+1 Method

Use TWO senses automatically (typically sight and sound), then add a THIRD for interest and depth. Add fourth and fifth senses only when the scene truly calls for it.

Overwhelming every scene with all five senses slows pacing. Strategic deployment creates impact when you need it.

### Break the Visual Habit

If you're sighted, you likely over-rely on visual description. Try introducing a scene by its scent, or describe the sound first.

Good:
> You hear heavy footsteps before you smell tobacco and leather. The man who enters fills the doorway.

Bad:
> The tall man with brown hair enters the room.

### Sensory Details Anchor Abstract Moments

Introspection, dialogue, and exposition feel untethered without sensory anchors. Ground internal moments in body and environment.

Good:
> Your hands tremble as you consider the offer. The clock's tick fills the silence.

Bad:
> You think carefully about the offer. It's a difficult decision.

### Specificity Over Generic + Modifier

Choose specific nouns rather than piling on adjectives and adverbs.

Good:
> The Pit Bull barked.

Bad:
> The big dog barked loudly.

## Pacing and Brevity

### Screen Reading Fatigue

Digital reading is fragmentary. Big blocks of uninterrupted text create feelings of unease and look oppressive on screen. White space is your friend.

**Optimal Paragraph Length:** Rarely more than 3-4 sentences. Use white space generously.

### Sentence Length Controls Pace

**Short sentences** increase pace, build tension, create urgency. Ideal for action sequences.

**Longer sentences** slow down speed, suggest calm or introspection. Ideal for reflective moments.

**Sentence fragments** create the quickest pace. Use sparingly for impact.

### Match Content to Pace

Fast-paced action:
> You run. The door slams. Footsteps behind you.

Calm reflection:
> You stand at the window, watching rain trace slow patterns down the glass, each drop catching the lamplight before sliding into darkness.

### Bad vs Good Example

Bad (Wall of Text):
> You enter the cathedral and see that it's enormous with high vaulted ceilings covered in frescoes depicting scenes from ancient myths and the walls are lined with tall stained glass windows through which colored light streams in making patterns on the stone floor.

Good (White Space, Varied Rhythm):
> You enter the cathedral.
>
> The space opens around you—enormous, with vaulted ceilings covered in frescoes. Ancient myths play out in faded colors overhead.
>
> Colored light streams through stained glass, painting patterns on the stone floor.

## Paragraph Cadence

### What Is Cadence?

Cadence is the natural rise and fall of sentences—the timing that determines whether readers turn pages or close the book. While interactive fiction is read silently, the "sound" of writing still matters.

### Sentence Length Variation

Monotony kills rhythm. Mix short, medium, and long sentences for natural rise and fall.

Bad (Monotonous):
> You open the door. You see a hallway. You walk down the hallway. You hear a sound. You stop walking.

Good (Varied Cadence):
> You open the door.
>
> A long hallway stretches before you, dim and silent. You walk forward, footsteps echoing. Then—a sound. You freeze.

### Match Rhythm to Emotion

**Action Scene (Fast):**
> You run. The creature's breath rasps behind you. Closer. Your heart hammers. The exit—there—just ahead.

**Contemplative Scene (Slow):**
> You sit by the water's edge, watching light dance across small waves. Memories surface slowly, like bubbles rising from the depths.

### Punctuation as Timing

Punctuation isn't just grammar—it's rhythm.

- Well-placed comma = pause, hesitation
- Em dash = emphasis, interruption
- Period = full stop, weight

Example:
> You reach for the door—stop. Listen.

## Prose for Interactive Fiction

### Choice Lead-Ins

The paragraph before choices requires special attention. It should:

- Create context for the decision
- Present the situation without dictating the response
- End in a way that makes choices feel natural

**Good lead-in:**
> The guard's eyes narrow. He hasn't moved for the door yet, but his hand rests near his weapon.

**Bad lead-in:**
> You need to decide what to do about the guard who is blocking your path and might be dangerous.

The bad example tells the player what they already know. The good example shows the situation and lets choices complete the thought.

### Transition Prose

When choices lead to new passages, the opening prose must orient without repeating:

**After choice "Climb the tower":**

Good:
> The stairs wind upward, each step groaning under your weight. Wind howls through arrow slits.

Bad:
> You decided to climb the tower. You are now climbing the tower stairs.

The bad example narrates the choice back to the player. The good example shows the consequence in action.

### Prose Density for Screens

Interactive fiction is read on screens. Adjust prose accordingly:

| Context | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Story passages | 100-200 words typical |
| Action sequences | 50-100 words |
| Major revelations | May exceed 200 words |
| Choice text | 5-15 words each |

Dense literary prose that works in print can feel oppressive on screen. White space is structural, not decorative.

### Maintaining Consistency Across Authors

Multi-author IF projects need prose style guides covering:

- Preferred sentence lengths
- Vocabulary constraints (especially for period pieces)
- Sensory detail density
- Paragraph formatting conventions
- Punctuation preferences (em dashes, semicolons)

## Common Pitfalls

### The Info Dump

Don't front-load world-building. Reveal information as it becomes relevant to player choices.

### Mismatched Rhythm

Long, flowing sentences during panic scenes feel wrong. Short, choppy sentences during meditation jar the reader. Rhythm should reflect what the scene feels like.

### Monotonous Length

Strings of identical-length sentences quickly become tedious. Vary your rhythm.

### Reading Aloud Test

Read your prose aloud during editing. If you trip over a line, your reader will too. Listen for places you run out of breath (sentences too long) or where rhythm drags (needs variation).

## Quick Reference

| Goal | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Immediacy | Second person + present tense |
| Grounding | 2+1 sensory method |
| Fast pace | Short sentences, fragments |
| Slow pace | Longer sentences, more detail |
| Rhythm | Vary sentence lengths |
| Emphasis | White space before/after |
| Clarity | Specific nouns over adjectives |

## Research Basis

Sources on prose craft:

| Concept | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Second-person IF convention | Emily Short, various blog posts on IF craft (2006-present) |
| Sensory writing | Constance Hale, *Sin and Syntax* (2013); Gary Provost, *Make Every Word Count* (1990) |
| Sentence rhythm | Gary Provost, "This sentence has five words" (famous demonstration) |
| Screen reading | Jakob Nielsen, usability research on online reading patterns |
| White space in prose | William Zinsser, *On Writing Well* (1976) |

Provost's rhythm demonstration: "This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony."
