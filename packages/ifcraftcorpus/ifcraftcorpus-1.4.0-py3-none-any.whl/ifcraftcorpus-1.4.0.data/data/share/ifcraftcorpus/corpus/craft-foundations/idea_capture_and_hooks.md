# Idea Capture and Deferred Work

Craft guidance for capturing ideas that arise during creative work without derailing current tasks—hook types, deferral decisions, and managing creative backlog.

---

## The Problem: Ideas at the Wrong Time

Creative work generates ideas constantly. While writing one scene, you think of:

- A backstory that should exist
- A future scene that would be compelling
- A fact that needs verification
- A style pattern worth documenting
- A character detail worth developing

**The trap:** Chasing every idea derails current work.

**The solution:** Capture ideas for later without losing them.

---

## Hook Cards

### What Is a Hook?

A **hook** is a captured idea, question, or opportunity that doesn't need resolution now but should be tracked for future work.

Hooks are:

- Quick to create (don't break flow)
- Specific enough to act on later
- Tagged for appropriate follow-up
- Triaged periodically

### Hook Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| canon_gap | Lore that should exist but doesn't | "Lighthouse keeper's backstory unexplained" |
| scene_idea | Future scene worth developing | "Flashback showing the founding ceremony" |
| fact_check | Claim needing verification | "Was gaslight common in 1850s factories?" |
| style_note | Aesthetic opportunity or concern | "Consider recurring fog motif" |
| character_note | Emerging trait worth formalizing | "Foreman's nervous gesture with ring" |
| media_cue | Visual or audio enhancement | "This scene needs ambient machinery sounds" |

### Hook Structure

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Type | Hook category (see above) |
| Summary | One-line description |
| Context | Where this arose, what it connects to |
| Suggested owner | Who should address this |
| Priority hint | Urgency or importance (optional) |

### Example Hooks

**Canon Gap:**

```
Type: canon_gap
Summary: Lighthouse keeper motivation unclear
Context: Referenced in passage SB-003 as having "a secret"
         but no canon explains what secret or why
Suggested owner: lore_weaver
```

**Scene Idea:**

```
Type: scene_idea
Summary: Flashback to the night of the fire
Context: Characters reference "what happened" repeatedly;
         showing it would add impact
Suggested owner: plotwright
```

**Fact Check:**

```
Type: fact_check
Summary: Could a message reach London in one day from Edinburgh in 1845?
Context: Plot depends on urgent letter arriving overnight
Suggested owner: researcher
```

## When to Create Hooks

### Mandatory Hook Triggers

Create a hook if ANY of these occur during work:

| Trigger | Hook Type | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Lore should exist but doesn't | canon_gap | Faction history referenced but undefined |
| Scene idea for later | scene_idea | "This would make a great prologue" |
| Fact needs verification | fact_check | Historical claim you're not sure about |
| Style guidance missing | style_note | "Should weather reflect mood?" |
| Character trait emerges | character_note | Recurring behavior worth formalizing |
| Media opportunity | media_cue | Visual or audio enhancement idea |

### When NOT to Create Hooks

Don't defer what's needed NOW:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Missing information blocks current work | Research or ask—don't defer |
| Core plot element | Include in current work |
| Structural decision | Make it or escalate |
| Quality issue | Fix it now |

**Rule:** Hooks capture opportunities. Blockers require immediate attention.

## The Deferral Decision

### Decision Framework

```
Is this needed to complete current task?
├── YES → Handle now (not a hook)
└── NO → Would it improve the story?
         ├── YES → Create hook
         └── NO → Let it go
```

### Good Deferrals

- Backstory that enriches but isn't essential
- Future scenes beyond current scope
- Research that would be nice to verify
- Style patterns worth considering
- Character depth beyond immediate needs

### Bad Deferrals

- Information blocking current progress
- Structural decisions affecting current work
- Quality issues in current deliverables
- Consistency problems that will cascade

## Hook Lifecycle

### States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Proposed | Newly captured, awaiting triage |
| Accepted | Approved for development |
| Deferred | Postponed to future cycle |
| Rejected | Won't pursue (with reason) |
| Completed | Addressed and resolved |

### Triage Process

Periodically review proposed hooks:

1. **Read context** — What was this about?
2. **Assess value** — How much would this add?
3. **Assess effort** — How hard to address?
4. **Decide** — Accept, defer, or reject

### Triage Criteria

| Factor | Accept | Defer | Reject |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Value | High story impact | Nice to have | Minimal benefit |
| Effort | Manageable | Large scope | Disproportionate |
| Urgency | Blocks other work | No dependency | Never needed |
| Fit | Aligns with direction | Uncertain fit | Conflicts with vision |

## Managing Creative Backlog

### Backlog Hygiene

- **Review regularly** — Stale hooks lose context
- **Prune ruthlessly** — Not every idea deserves development
- **Group related hooks** — Patterns reveal priorities
- **Time-box triage** — Don't let backlog management consume creative time

### Prioritization

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| High | Blocks other work, high value, low effort |
| Medium | Significant value, moderate effort |
| Low | Nice to have, high effort or low value |
| Someday | Interesting but not current priority |

### Common Backlog Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Hook hoarding | Never rejecting anything | Set acceptance criteria |
| Context loss | Hooks become cryptic | Capture enough detail |
| Deferred forever | Nothing gets addressed | Schedule development time |
| Duplicate hooks | Same idea multiple times | Search before creating |

## Integration with Creative Workflow

### During Writing

1. Notice idea arising
2. Quick assessment: needed now or deferrable?
3. If deferrable: capture hook (30 seconds)
4. Return to current work immediately

### Between Writing Sessions

1. Review recent hooks
2. Quick triage: accept/defer/reject
3. Update priorities if needed
4. Continue with primary work

### Dedicated Development

1. Select accepted hooks for development
2. Work through systematically
3. Mark completed
4. Generate new hooks as needed

## Hook Quality

### Good Hook

```
Type: canon_gap
Summary: Union hall meeting procedures undefined
Context: Passage SB-007 has characters attending a union meeting
         but we have no canon for how meetings run, who speaks,
         voting procedures, etc. Currently hand-waved.
Suggested owner: lore_weaver
Priority hint: Medium - affects 3+ scenes
```

Clear, specific, actionable, contextual.

### Bad Hook

```
Type: scene_idea
Summary: Something about the lighthouse
```

Vague, no context, not actionable.

### Hook Quality Checklist

- [ ] Type correctly categorized
- [ ] Summary is specific and actionable
- [ ] Context explains where this arose
- [ ] Context explains why it matters
- [ ] Suggested owner makes sense
- [ ] Enough detail to act on later

## Quick Reference

| Hook Type | When to Use | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| canon_gap | Missing lore | Worldbuilder/Lorekeeper |
| scene_idea | Future scene | Plotter/Architect |
| fact_check | Needs verification | Researcher |
| style_note | Aesthetic pattern | Style guide owner |
| character_note | Emerging trait | Character developer |
| media_cue | Visual/audio idea | Media planner |

| Decision | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Handle now | Blocks current work |
| Create hook | Improves story, not needed now |
| Let it go | Minimal benefit |
