# Children and YA Genre Conventions

Craft guidance on the specific genre tropes and narrative patterns found in Children's (Middle Grade) and Young Adult (YA) fiction.

---

## Key Archetypes

### The Chosen One (Reimagined)

While a classic fantasy trope, in YA/MG it specifically represents **adolescent empowerment**.

* **MG Version:** Wonder and wish fulfillment. "I am special/magical."
* **YA Version:** Burden and responsibility. "Why me? I didn't ask for this."
* *Subversion:* The "Unchosen One" (the sidekick who has to save the day).

### The Absent Adult

To give young protagonists agency, adults must be removed or incapacitated.

* **The Orphan:** Classic removal of safety net.
* **The Clueless Parent:** Loving but doesn't understand the magic/stakes.
* **The Antagonistic Authority:** Adults represent oppressive systems (Dystopian).

### The Found Family

A core emotional anchor in YA.

* Protagonists find belonging not in blood relations, but in a ragtag group of misfits.
* *Mechanics:* Party banter, loyalty missions, group dynamic choices.

## Narrative Structures

### Coming of Age (Bildungsroman)

The journey from innocence to experience.

1. **Status Quo:** Childlike dependence.
2. **Inciting Incident:** Separation from home/safety.
3. **Trials:** Learning skills, failing, understanding complexity.
4. **Resolution:** Return as an independent individual (Adult).

### The School Setting

A microcosm of society.

* **Sortings/Factions:** Defines identity (Houses, Cliques).
* **The Academic Year:** Provides natural pacing (Term start, Holidays, Finals/Climax).
* **Dual Life:** Balancing homework with saving the world.

### The Masquerade (Secret Magic)

Common in Urban Fantasy YA.

* The protagonist discovers a hidden world overlapping the mundane one.
* *Tension:* Keeping the secret from parents/friends.
* *Metaphor:* Often represents the "secret self" (queer identity, neurodivergence) finding community.

## Middle Grade (MG) vs. Young Adult (YA)

| Feature | Middle Grade (8-12) | Young Adult (13-18) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Family, Friends, Adventure | Identity, Romance, Society |
| **Romance** | Crushes, hand-holding, "Ew/Cute" | Central plot, angst, sexual tension |
| **Violence** | Stylized, bloodless | Visceral, consequential |
| **Ending** | Hopeful, order restored | Bittersweet, world changed |
| **Voice** | Earnest, observant | Introspective, sometimes cynical |

---

## Writing Dystopian YA

**Core Convention:** The personal is political.

* The teen's rebellion against strict rules mirrors their internal rebellion against childhood constraints.
* *Trope:* The Love Triangle as a choice between two futures/ideologies (e.g., Safe Tradition vs. Dangerous Freedom).

---

## Quick Reference

| Trope | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Sorting** | Rapid character identity definition. |
| **Absent Parents** | Forces protagonist agency. |
| **First Love** | High stakes emotion; everything feels new/intense. |
| **The Rebellion** | Externalizing the internal teen struggle for autonomy. |
