# Scene Structure and Beat Integration

Craft guidance for structuring individual scenes—paragraph cadence, beat integration, and the handoff from structural planning to prose execution.

---

## The Brief-to-Prose Pipeline

### Two-Stage Creation

Interactive fiction benefits from separating structure from prose:

| Stage | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Planning | What happens, choices, connections | Brief |
| Writing | How it reads, voice, sensory detail | Prose |

**Why separate?**

- Structure decisions shouldn't be hostage to prose
- Prose shouldn't accidentally change structure
- Different skills, different review criteria
- Easier to iterate each independently

### What a Brief Contains

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Intent | What the player is trying to achieve |
| Stakes | What's at risk |
| Beats | Key moments that must occur |
| Choices | Options and their intents (not final wording) |
| Connections | Where choices lead (topology) |
| Constraints | What NOT to do |

### What a Brief Does NOT Contain

- Final prose (that's the writer's job)
- Voice decisions (that's style's job)
- Exact wording of choices (implies options, not text)

---

## The Three-Paragraph Cadence

### Default Scene Structure

Full scenes benefit from a three-paragraph minimum:

| Paragraph | Function | Content |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1. Lead | Image + Motion | Sensory grounding, character entering/acting |
| 2. Middle | Goal + Friction | What character wants, what's in the way |
| 3. Close | Choice Setup | Context for the upcoming decision |

### Why Three Paragraphs?

- **One paragraph** feels rushed—no room to breathe
- **Two paragraphs** often lacks choice context
- **Three paragraphs** establishes place, conflict, and decision naturally

**This is a minimum, not a maximum.** Complex scenes may need more.

### Paragraph 1: Lead Image + Motion

**Purpose:** Ground the reader in place and action.

**Contains:**

- Sensory details (2+ senses)
- Character in motion or arriving
- Immediate physical context
- Tone establishment

**Example:**
> The factory floor stretched before him, a maze of clattering looms and lint-thick air. Steam rose from somewhere deeper in, hazing the morning light that fought through grimy windows. Marcus stepped over a tangle of thread, nodding to a woman feeding cloth into a machine that screamed louder than conversation.

### Paragraph 2: Goal/Vector + Friction

**Purpose:** Establish what the character wants and what's in the way.

**Contains:**

- Character's immediate goal
- Obstacle or complication
- Rising tension
- Forward momentum

**Example:**
> He needed to find the foreman before the shift change—before anyone noticed the missing ledger. But the floor supervisor was already watching, her eyes tracking him through the machinery. She'd want to know why he wasn't at his station.

### Paragraph 3: Choice Setup

**Purpose:** Create context for the decision the reader will make.

**Contains:**

- Immediate situation requiring action
- Relevant information for decision
- Transition to choices
- (NOT the choices themselves—those are separate)

**Example:**
> The foreman's office door stood half-open at the far end. Between here and there: thirty yards of open floor, the supervisor's suspicious gaze, and a bell that would signal shift change in minutes. He could try to slip past unnoticed, or he could have a word with the supervisor first—establish a reason for being off-station.

## Micro-Beats and Transitions

### What Is a Micro-Beat?

A **micro-beat** is a brief transitional passage between full scenes. It moves the reader through time or space without full scene development.

**Characteristics:**

- 1 paragraph is acceptable (exception to three-paragraph rule)
- Connects two full scenes
- Minimal prose
- Must be explicitly framed as transition

### When to Use Micro-Beats

| Use | Don't Use |
|-----|-----------|
| Time passage ("The next morning...") | Important conversations |
| Travel between locations | Scenes with choices |
| Mood bridges | Character development moments |
| Montage effects | Plot-critical events |

### Micro-Beat Structure

**Single paragraph containing:**

- Time/place transition
- Brief sensory anchor
- Forward momentum
- Setup for next full scene

**Example:**
> The walk back to the boarding house took longer than usual. Marcus chose the route through the market district, letting the noise and crowds settle his thoughts. By the time he climbed the narrow stairs to his room, the evening bells were ringing.

### The Reflection Rule

**After a micro-beat, the next full scene must carry the reflection.**

If you compress a transition, the following scene needs to:

- Acknowledge what happened
- Show emotional aftermath
- Provide the affordances the micro-beat skipped

---

## Beat Integration

### What Are Story Beats?

**Beats** are planned moments that must occur within a scene:

- Discoveries ("Player finds the hidden letter")
- Revelations ("Character admits the truth")
- State changes ("Player gains trust of the faction")
- Choices ("Player decides whether to reveal the secret")

### Integrating Beats into Prose

Beats come from the brief. The writer's job is to make them feel natural.

**Bad integration:** Beat feels forced, interrupts flow.

**Good integration:** Beat emerges from scene action, feels inevitable.

### Beat Integration Checklist

For each beat in the brief:

- [ ] Where in the scene does it naturally fit?
- [ ] What action or dialogue delivers it?
- [ ] Does it advance or respond to character goals?
- [ ] Does the scene flow into and out of it smoothly?

### Example: Integrating a Discovery Beat

**Brief says:** "Player discovers foreman's hidden ledger."

**Bad integration:**
> Marcus looked around the office. He found a hidden ledger. It contained secrets.

**Good integration:**
> The desk drawer stuck halfway—not locked, but catching on something. He worked it open another inch and felt paper bunched at the back, deliberately wedged. A smaller ledger, bound in different leather than the others, fell into his hand when he finally freed it.

## Choice Presentation

### Choices Are Not Prose

Choices appear after the prose, as distinct options. The prose sets up the decision; the choices are the options.

**Scene prose ends before choices.**

### Choice Text Principles

| Principle | Good | Bad |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Contrastive | Different verbs/objects | Near-synonyms |
| Diegetic | In-world actions | Meta-instructions |
| Consequential | Imply different outcomes | Seem equivalent |
| Concise | Action-focused | Lengthy explanations |

### Choice Setup in Prose

The final paragraph should make choices feel natural:

- Present the situation requiring decision
- Hint at available options without listing them
- Create urgency or stakes
- Let choices complete the thought

**Example:**
> Prose: "The supervisor was waiting by the door when he emerged. Her expression suggested she wanted answers—now."
>
> Choices:
>
> - Tell her about the missing inventory
> - Claim you were checking on a sick colleague
> - Push past without explanation

## Scene Length Calibration

### When Scenes Feel Too Short

If a scene feels rushed:

- Add sensory grounding (lead paragraph)
- Develop the obstacle (middle paragraph)
- Expand choice context (close paragraph)
- Consider whether beats are earning their weight

### When Scenes Feel Too Long

If a scene drags:

- Is every paragraph advancing something?
- Could beats be combined or cut?
- Is description serving purpose or just filling space?
- Should this be multiple scenes?

### The Auto-Extension Rule

**If a draft is less than 3 paragraphs and NOT a designated micro-beat:**

Add a movement/vector paragraph before presenting choices.

This prevents thin scenes from feeling incomplete.

## Common Scene Mistakes

### Front-Loaded Exposition

**Problem:** First paragraph dumps background instead of grounding scene.

**Fix:** Start with action and place. Weave exposition into movement.

### Missing Stakes

**Problem:** Scene presents situation without showing why it matters.

**Fix:** Middle paragraph should establish what's at risk.

### Disconnected Choices

**Problem:** Choices don't feel like natural responses to the scene.

**Fix:** Final paragraph should create the decision context.

### Beat Collisions

**Problem:** Too many beats crammed into one scene.

**Fix:** Spread beats across scenes or cut less essential ones.

### Register Breaks

**Problem:** Prose shifts voice or formality mid-scene.

**Fix:** Maintain consistent register throughout.

## Quick Reference

| Scene Element | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Lead paragraph | Sensory grounding, character in motion |
| Middle paragraph | Goal and obstacle, rising tension |
| Close paragraph | Decision context, choice setup |
| Micro-beat | Transition between full scenes (1 para OK) |
| Beat | Planned moment to integrate naturally |
| Choice | Distinct option following prose |

| Scene Issue | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Too short | Develop each paragraph function |
| Too long | Cut or split |
| Rushed | Add reflection after micro-beats |
| Disconnected | Ensure choices follow from setup |
