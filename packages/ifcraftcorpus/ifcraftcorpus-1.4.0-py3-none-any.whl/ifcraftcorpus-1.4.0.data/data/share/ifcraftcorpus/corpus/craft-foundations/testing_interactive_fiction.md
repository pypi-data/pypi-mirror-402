# Testing Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for testing interactive fiction—playtesting methodologies, branch coverage, feedback collection, and iterative improvement.

---

## Why IF Testing Differs

Interactive fiction presents unique testing challenges:

| Challenge | Why It's Different |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Branching paths | Testers can't see all content in one playthrough |
| Player agency | What feels intuitive varies by player |
| State dependencies | Bugs may only appear under specific conditions |
| Narrative coherence | Story must work across all valid paths |
| Pacing variability | Different players progress at different speeds |

Traditional QA catches bugs. IF testing must also assess experience, comprehension, and emotional impact across all branches.

## Playtest Session Structure

### Pre-Session Preparation

**For the author/facilitator:**

- Define what you're testing (pacing? clarity? choices?)
- Prepare observation template
- Set up recording if permitted
- Have save points ready at key branches

**For playtesters:**

- Explain the process and time commitment
- Clarify whether to think aloud or play silently
- Specify if you want gut reactions or analytical feedback
- Ask permission for recording/observation

### During Playtest

**Observation focus:**

- Where does the player hesitate?
- When do they re-read?
- What do they click first?
- Where do they express confusion (verbal or facial)?
- What makes them smile or lean in?

**Do not:**

- Explain things while they play
- Defend your choices
- Guide them toward "correct" paths
- Interrupt flow unless stuck

### Post-Session Debrief

**Immediate questions (while memory fresh):**

1. "What was the story about?" (comprehension check)
2. "What were the hardest decisions?" (engagement check)
3. "Was anything confusing?" (clarity check)
4. "Where did you get stuck?" (usability check)
5. "What would you have liked to do that you couldn't?" (agency check)

**Avoid leading questions:**

Bad: "Did you find the lighthouse scene atmospheric?"

Good: "How did you feel during the lighthouse scene?"

## Feedback Collection Methods

### Think-Aloud Protocol

Players verbalize thoughts while playing.

**Advantages:**

- Real-time insight into player thinking
- Catches confusion as it happens
- Reveals interpretation of choices

**Disadvantages:**

- Changes the experience (less immersive)
- Some players uncomfortable verbalizing
- Can slow pacing

**Best for:** Early structural testing, choice clarity assessment.

### Silent Play + Retrospective

Players play silently; discuss after.

**Advantages:**

- Preserves immersion
- Natural play patterns
- Memory highlights what mattered

**Disadvantages:**

- Loses moment-to-moment reactions
- Memory filters and rationalizes
- May miss subtle confusion points

**Best for:** Emotional impact testing, pacing assessment.

### Written Surveys

Players complete questionnaire after playing.

**Advantages:**

- Scalable to many testers
- Standardized data
- Testers can reflect before responding

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited depth
- Self-report bias
- No follow-up possible

**Best for:** Large-scale testing, comparing versions.

### Recorded Sessions

Screen + audio recording of playtest.

**Advantages:**

- Review later for missed details
- Share with team members
- Compare across sessions

**Disadvantages:**

- Privacy concerns
- Changes player behavior
- Time-consuming to review

**Best for:** Deep analysis, training facilitators.

## Branch Coverage Testing

### The Coverage Problem

A 10-passage story with 2 choices per passage has 512 possible paths. No single playtest reveals all content.

### Systematic Coverage Approaches

**Breadth-first testing:**

Test all branches at first decision, then all at second, etc.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Catches first-branch bugs quickly | Misses deep-path issues |

**Depth-first testing:**

Complete one full path before trying alternatives.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Tests full narrative arcs | May miss early-branch issues |

**Priority-based testing:**

Focus on main paths first, edge cases later.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Efficient use of time | Edge cases may ship broken |

### Minimum Viable Coverage

Not every path needs human playtesting. Prioritize:

1. **Main narrative spines** — Every intended primary path
2. **Critical branches** — High-stakes choices
3. **Edge cases** — Unusual combinations
4. **Failure states** — Deaths, game-overs, early endings

### Automated Testing

Where possible, automate:

- Link validity (no broken references)
- Reachability (all passages accessible)
- State consistency (flags set correctly)
- Variable bounds (no impossible values)

Reserve human testing for:

- Emotional impact
- Narrative coherence
- Choice meaningfulness
- Pacing and rhythm

## Common Testing Focuses

### Comprehension Testing

**Question:** Do players understand what's happening?

**Indicators:**

- Can summarize plot after playing
- Understand character motivations
- Recognize consequences of choices
- Follow temporal/spatial logic

**Warning signs:**

- "Wait, who was that?"
- "Why did that happen?"
- Re-reading repeatedly
- Choosing randomly (giving up on understanding)

### Choice Clarity Testing

**Question:** Do players understand what choices mean?

**Indicators:**

- Choices feel distinct, not synonymous
- Outcomes match expectations
- No "gotcha" surprises (unless intended)
- Players feel agency, not confusion

**Warning signs:**

- "I thought that would..."
- "Both options seem the same"
- Hovering between choices excessively
- Frustration at outcomes

### Pacing Testing

**Question:** Does the story flow well?

**Indicators:**

- Players stay engaged
- Emotional beats land with weight
- Action sequences feel urgent
- Reflective moments feel earned

**Warning signs:**

- Skimming text
- Impatience at choices
- "Is it almost over?"
- Checking time/phone

### State Testing

**Question:** Does the story track player actions correctly?

**Indicators:**

- NPCs remember past interactions
- Environment reflects player changes
- Consequences appear at right time
- No impossible situations

**Warning signs:**

- "But I already did that"
- Characters forget relationships
- Locked doors that should be open
- Items appearing/disappearing wrong

## Iterating on Feedback

### Triage Feedback

Not all feedback requires action:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Bug | Fix |
| Confusion | Clarify or rethink |
| Preference | Note but evaluate broadly |
| Feature request | Consider scope |
| Misunderstanding | Check if writing caused it |

### Pattern Recognition

One player's confusion might be their issue. Three players' confusion is your problem.

**Look for:**

- Repeated confusion at same points
- Similar misinterpretations
- Consistent pacing complaints
- Recurring choice regret

### When Not to Change

Sometimes feedback reveals the work is doing its job:

- "I didn't like the consequence" (consequence landed)
- "That choice was hard" (intended difficulty)
- "I wanted to save everyone" (meant to be impossible)
- "The ending was sad" (if tragedy intended)

### Version Control for Iteration

Maintain clear versions:

- Save before each major revision
- Note what feedback prompted changes
- Test after changes (may introduce new issues)
- Track which testers saw which versions

---

## Special Testing Considerations

### Testing with Fresh Eyes

Players who've seen earlier versions carry knowledge forward. For final testing, recruit testers who've never seen the work.

### Author Blind Spots

Authors know too much. They:

- Fill gaps readers can't
- See foreshadowing that isn't there
- Understand choices that aren't clear
- Know the "right" path

Author testing catches bugs, not experience issues.

### Diverse Testers

Different testers notice different things:

| Tester Type | Strengths |
|-------------|-----------|
| Genre fans | Expectation matching |
| Genre newcomers | Clarity for all audiences |
| Fast readers | Pacing issues |
| Slow readers | Density issues |
| Completionists | Branch coverage |
| Story-focused | Narrative coherence |

### Accessibility Testing

Include testers using:

- Screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast modes
- Extended time for reading

See [Accessibility Guidelines](../audience-and-access/accessibility_guidelines.md) for standards.

## Research Basis

Sources on playtest methodology:

| Concept | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Think-aloud protocol | Clayton Lewis, "Using the 'Thinking Aloud' Method" (1982) |
| Usability testing | Jakob Nielsen, *Usability Engineering* (1993) |
| Game QA | various industry practices from Gamasutra/Game Developer |
| IF-specific testing | Emily Short, craft essays on playtest methodology |

The think-aloud protocol originated in cognitive psychology and was adapted for software usability testing before becoming standard in game design.
