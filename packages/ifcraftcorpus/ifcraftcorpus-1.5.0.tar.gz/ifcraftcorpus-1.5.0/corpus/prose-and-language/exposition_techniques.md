# Exposition Techniques

Craft guidance for handling exposition—show vs tell, natural reveals, avoiding info dumps, and managing reader trust.

---

## Show vs Tell

### Core Principle

**Show:** Use sensory details, actions, and concrete descriptions. Engages readers by letting them experience the story.

**Tell:** Abstract statements that inform readers of facts. Efficient but less engaging.

### When to Show

Show for the majority of your fiction—this builds scenes and emotional connections.

**Emotions:**

Bad (Tell): "She was nervous."

Good (Show): "She jostled her leg under the table, fingers drumming the armrest."

**Character Traits:**

Bad (Tell): "John is devoted to his wife."

Good (Show): "John always picks his wife up at the airport with fresh flowers. Last week, when all highways were closed, he drove two hours through back-country roads to get there on time."

**Settings:**

Bad (Tell): "It was raining heavily."

Good (Show): "Rain pelted the windows like a thousand tiny drums, blurring the view and casting the world in a constant sheet of gray."

### When to Tell

Telling has legitimate uses:

**Stating Facts Efficiently:**
> The cafe was fifteen blocks away, and she only had five minutes.

Acceptable context for a character running.

**Stating Feelings Quickly:**
> She was exhausted.

Fine when you don't need to dwell on the emotion.

**Pacing Efficiency:**
When you need to move the story forward without slowing down, telling gets to the point.

**Internal Narrative:**
A character's private thoughts sometimes work better told than shown.

### The Balance

Don't NEVER tell—understand what you're writing and what function it serves. Find the balance that paints a picture without overwriting or killing pacing.

### Common Pitfall: Tell After Show

If you've shown a character's anger through clenched fists and a red face, don't then write "He was angry." Trust your showing.

## Natural Information Reveals

### Integrate Through Character Experience

Show worldbuilding through character interactions, not author explanation. Readers discover the world alongside characters through how it affects them.

### POV as Filter

Deliver backstory through your focal character's thoughts, impressions, and emotional reactions. When you jump out of perspective to fill readers in, you pause the scene and sabotage immersion.

**Character Perception Shapes Description:**

A servant summoned to the duke's study notices exits and threats. A courtier seeking favor notices opulence and status symbols. Same room, different descriptions based on who's perceiving.

### The Character Learning Curve

J.K. Rowling introduces necessary information through Harry's experiences and discoveries. She creates a learning curve for Harry that matches the reader's—through action, not explanation.

**Technique:** Give your POV character a reason to be learning. A newcomer, outsider, or fish-out-of-water naturally encounters information the reader needs.

### Show Through Reaction

In Game of Thrones, we understand the significance of finding a direwolf through character reactions: they draw swords, discuss how direwolves haven't been seen for two hundred years, show fear and wonder. We're never lectured about direwolf significance.

### Start with Landmarks

Readers come to your world with fresh eyes. Ease them in with familiar elements—a goat grazing, a cobblestone street. Start with the recognizable, then introduce one new thing at a time.

### Reveal When Relevant

Don't front-load information. Reveal aspects of the world as they become relevant to the story. Details about a city's history can be woven into a scene where a character navigates its streets, not delivered in a preamble.

## Avoiding Info Dumps

### What Is an Info Dump?

An info dump pauses or halts action to provide background context—typically a paragraph or more. It "effectively boots the reader out of the story."

**Key insight:** It's the "dump" that's bad, not the "info." Information may be necessary, but dumping it without regard to context, timing, or tension turns good info into an infodump.

### Why They Fail

Readers don't latch onto dumped information—they naturally skim over it. Info dumps interrupt narrative flow and disengage readers.

### Common Info Dump Locations

1. **Prologues and prefaces** - Laying groundwork for world history
2. **Opening chapters** - Front-loading worldbuilding
3. **Introducing new characters/settings** - Explaining everything at once
4. **Between action beats** - Exposition between plot movement

### The "As You Know, Bob" Trap

Characters discussing something they both already know, purely to inform the reader.

Bad:
> "As you know, Bob, our company was founded in 1952 when your grandfather invented the widget..."

People don't tell each other things they already know. The only reason for this dialogue is to transmit information to readers, and it's obvious.

### The Iceberg Principle

Ernest Hemingway: "There is seven-eighths of it underwater for every part that shows."

The most powerful story elements are implied or left to imagination. Like an iceberg, only a small part of your story's structure should be visible.

**Ask:** What can I leave out? What can I imply rather than state? What's a more clever, less obvious way to convey this?

### Drip-Feeding Techniques

Incorporate details seamlessly without pausing for authorial asides.

**Throwaway References:**
> "She hopped in an air-taxi."

Tells you about the world without stopping narrative.

**Details Through Action:**
A detective examining a body instead of talking about it. A wizard walking through a magical market rather than describing it.

**Replace Description with Action:**
Instead of explaining a spouse's love, show it through their actions.

### Stay in the Room

Wherever you are, whenever you are, stay there as much as possible. Stay with what's happening in the moment. Don't interrupt action with background exposition.

## Reader Trust

### What Readers Need to Know When

**Golden rule:** Drop in backstory, especially secrets, only when readers need to know it—at the moment it will make the biggest impact.

Revealing backstory too early slams the brakes on the novel. Hold reveals for maximum impact.

### Earning the Reveal

Readers don't want information dumped at their feet. They want to earn the reveal. Set up revelations through foreshadowing. Make characters ask questions, then provide answers only when they'll impact with maximum power.

**The Breadcrumb Trail:**
The careful dance between foreshadowing and revealing is the secret power of master writers. Lure readers deeper via a trail of revelations.

### When Withholding Fails

Withholding information can feel manipulative if you're doing it for tension's sake rather than story logic. This creates a "hitch"—a moment where readers feel they've missed something.

**The Difference:** Delayed gratification keeps readers hooked, but not if it contains a hitch.

### Challenge, Don't Confuse

A mystery should challenge, not confuse. Simplicity beneath complexity is the hallmark of great plotting.

Keep readers guessing but never lost. Offer real clues while weaving in misdirection.

### Give Answers AFTER Questions

**Critical mistake:** Giving answers before questions. Great exposition only arms readers with what they NEED to enjoy the scene. Everything else waits.

First make readers care about the question, then provide the answer when it matters most.

### Trust Your Reader

Trusting your reader means believing they can pick up on clues—not just mystery clues, but hints about backstory, worldbuilding, characterization.

**Common Mistake:** Writers explain everything because they don't trust the audience to "get it." They show something, then write paragraphs telling what readers already understood.

Writers tend to over-explain, not under-explain. When wondering "Will they get that?", look for clues that allow understanding. If you find them, don't worry about it.

## Pacing and Information Release

### Controlling Information Creates Suspense

Writing suspense is a matter of controlling information—how much you reveal, when, and how. In practical terms, suspense is a series of incremental steps.

### After Revelations, Slow Down

After a major reveal, slow pace so readers can take it in and make connections. Focus on setting and character reaction.

### Avoid Repetition

Watch for hitting readers over the head with the same clues repeatedly. Provide new information that's well-spaced throughout.

### Balancing Speed and Rest

- Too fast: Readers miss important details
- Too slow: Readers get bored
- Just right: Alternates tension with rest
