# Mystery Genre Conventions for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing mysteries—clue placement, fair play, detective archetypes, suspect pools, and satisfying solutions.

---

## Mystery Subgenres

### Cozy Mystery

**Core Conventions:**

- Violence and sex occur offstage
- Amateur sleuth protagonists (librarian, hobbyist, retired teacher)
- Small, socially intimate settings
- Tone is lighthearted despite serious crimes
- Justice always wins; endings wrap up neatly
- Murderers are community members, not psychopaths
- Motives rooted in greed, jealousy, revenge

**Language:** Playful—"kerfuffle" not "shakedown."

**Reader Contract:** Warm, safe experience with guaranteed resolution.

### Hardboiled

**Core Conventions:**

- Darker, realistic portrayal of crime
- Seasoned, cynical detectives who've "seen it all"
- Strong personal ethics despite moral ambiguity
- Gritty urban environments
- Professional investigators (PI, detective, journalist)
- Violence is on the table
- Crimes may not wrap up neatly

**Character Profile:** World-weary but likeable. Flawed with unresolved issues.

**Chandler's Rule:** Hero can "walk the mean streets but is not himself mean."

### Noir

**Core Conventions:**

- Blurred lines between moral good and bad
- "Regular guy" protagonist dragged into darkness
- Self-destructive protagonist
- Corrupt institutions and systems
- Detective morally compromised or trapped
- Often unhappy or ambiguous endings

**Key Distinction from Hardboiled:** Noir protagonists are more trapped, more compromised.

### Police Procedural

**Core Conventions:**

- Focus on police investigation process
- Unit/precinct as character, not lone detective
- Detailed police tactics and psychology
- Station-house politics
- Larger cast of characters
- Institutional constraints and pressures

### Locked Room / Impossible Crime

**Core Conventions:**

- Crime under seemingly impossible circumstances
- Limited suspect pool
- Solution must be believable and well-hidden
- Fair play essential—readers need chance to solve it

**Writing Technique:** Start from the end. Work backwards from solution to plant clues.

## Clue Placement

### The Cardinal Rule

**Present all necessary puzzle pieces to the reader.** You cannot hide information, but you CAN misdirect attention.

### The Rule of Three (Red Herrings)

For every crucial clue, include two convincing red herrings. Maintains fair play while keeping readers analyzing.

### The Rule of Three (Introduction)

Introduce important clues at least three times:

1. First mention: subtle
2. Second mention: more noticeable
3. Third mention: clear in hindsight

### Hiding Clues in Plain Sight

- Embed in everyday details
- Casual remarks
- Objects in the background
- Ordinary actions

Should only be recognized as significant after the reveal.

### Agatha Christie's Technique

> "Fashion scenes so the clue is present but so is the red herring. The scene pivots around the red herring, not the clue."

Make dramatic focus elsewhere while clues remain visible.

### Burying Clues

- Layer rather than clutter
- Goal is suspense, not confusion
- Timing matters: too early = forgotten; too late = desperate

---

## Fair Play Rules

### What Fair Play Means

Don't cheat the reader. All information needed to solve the mystery must be available.

### Unfair Practices

- Introducing murderer in late chapters when clues pointed elsewhere
- Using deus ex machina
- Detective "suddenly knows" things without investigation
- Withholding information the detective learned
- Solution depending on specialized knowledge readers can't have
- Identical twins or doubles unless established early
- Relying on unguessable coincidences

### Red Herrings Done Right

**A red herring is NOT a lie.** It's artful misdirection.

**Must Be:**

- Logical and inform the plot
- Eventually explained
- Incorporated into narrative
- Not treated as afterthought

**Bad Red Herring:** Character acts suspicious, then disappears with no explanation.

**Good Red Herring:** Character acts suspicious because hiding something unrelated (affair, embezzlement).

### Chekhov's Gun

If you show a gun in Act 1, it must fire by Act 3. Every planted element should serve the solution, act as red herring, or develop character/atmosphere.

## Revelation Timing

### The Golden Rule

> "Reveal too much too soon, and mystery loses intrigue; hold back too much, and you frustrate your audience."

### Distribution Strategy

- Earlier reveals shouldn't sap tension
- Later explanations shouldn't bog down climax
- Each reveal should feel rewarding

### Building to the Big Reveal

**The climax should feel surprising AND inevitable.**

**Requirements:**

- Groundwork laid with enough information
- Sudden twist reframes entire narrative
- All clues fit together
- Provides emotional and narrative satisfaction

### After the Big Reveal

**End quickly after the reveal.**

**Why:**

- Too much lingering dilutes tension
- Swift conclusion leaves lasting impression
- Preserves emotional resonance
- Creates powerful, satisfying endnote

**Common Mistake:** Dragging denouement for 20+ pages after solution revealed.

## Detective Archetypes

### Amateur Sleuth

**Characteristics:**

- No law enforcement connection
- Unpaid investigation
- Driven by curiosity or personal connection
- Less competent but resourceful
- Use observation and psychology

**Examples:** Miss Marple, Jessica Fletcher

### Private Investigator

**Characteristics:**

- Professional but operates on fringe of law
- Hardened edge and cynicism
- Follow own rules and methods
- May have police connections

**Examples:** Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe

### Police Detective

**Characteristics:**

- Official authority
- More bureaucratic, constrained by regulations
- Access to resources and information
- Team dynamics and politics

### Reluctant Sleuth

**Characteristics:**

- Expert but hesitant
- Drawn in despite wanting quiet life
- Use expertise to survive
- Often have traumatic past experience

### Flawed Detective

**Characteristics:**

- Addiction, relationship problems
- Haunted by past cases
- Obsessive personality
- Social difficulties

**Important:** Flaws should be relevant to story, not decoration.

## Building Suspect Pools

### Means, Motive, Opportunity

**Each suspect needs all three:**

**Motive:** Why would they commit the crime?

- Greed, jealousy, revenge
- Self-preservation
- Protection of loved ones

**Means:** Could they physically do it?

- Access to weapon
- Physical capability
- Technical knowledge

**Opportunity:** When could they have done it?

- Access to crime scene
- Weak alibi
- Unaccounted-for time

### Cast Diversity

Write suspects with diverse roles in victim's life:

- Close friend
- Business associate
- Stranger with connection
- Family member
- Romantic interest

### Character Development

**The criminal should be someone readers feel they know.**

Each suspect needs:

- Personal goal
- Believable motive
- Distinct personality
- Secrets (not necessarily murder-related)

### Common Mistakes

- Making one suspect obviously guilty
- Giving suspects transparent motivations
- Not developing personalities beyond "suspicious"
- Introducing new suspects late
- Not giving readers fair chance to consider all

---

## Solution Satisfaction

### The Paradox

**Climax should feel surprising AND inevitable.**

- All clues fit in retrospect
- Solution makes perfect sense once revealed
- Reader didn't see it coming

### The "Aha!" Test

After revelation, reader should say:

- "Of course!"
- "I should have seen that!"
- "The clues were all there!"

**NOT:**

- "That came out of nowhere"
- "When was that established?"

### Making It Inevitable

- Foreshadow solution elements early
- Plant clues in multiple places
- Make solution consistent with character motivations
- Use only established facts
- Simplest explanation fitting all facts

### Making It Surprising

- Misdirect attention to red herrings
- Hide significance of key clues
- Use reader assumptions against them
- Subvert expectations carefully

### Testing Your Solution

Questions to ask:

- Can reader solve with presented information?
- Does solution explain ALL clues?
- Are there plot holes?
- Does it respect character logic?
- Is it physically possible?
- Does timing work out?

## Interactive Fiction Considerations

### Player as Detective

**Core Principle:** Mystery fiction invites reader participation. Interactive fiction makes this explicit.

**Player Agency:**

- Choices shape investigation
- Multiple paths simulate real investigation
- Player decides where to spend time
- Branched endings reflect different results

### Maintaining Fair Play in IF

**Challenges:**

- Player might miss crucial scenes
- Branching can hide necessary clues
- Exploration order varies

**Solutions:**

- Ensure crucial clues accessible via multiple paths
- Gate progress until key evidence gathered
- Provide notebook/recap functionality
- Allow backtracking

### Evidence-Gathering Mechanics

- Each step poses puzzle of logic
- Player combines evidence from examination
- Web of clues to analyze
- Rewards detailed reading

### Choice Presentation

**Transparent (shows mechanics):**

> [Intelligence 12+ required] Question the witness

**Opaque (hidden mechanics):**

> Question the witness (success varies)

**Best Practice:** Diegetic language hiding mechanics.

### Common IF Mystery Mistakes

- Requiring obscure actions without hints
- Dead ends with no indication why
- Information overload without organization tools
- Trivial choices that don't matter
- Unclear consequences
- No wrong answers (removes puzzle element)

### Best Practices

- Provide evidence log/notebook
- Include character relationship tracker
- Make critical path clear but not obvious
- Reward thoroughness
- Test with unfamiliar players

## Common Mistakes

### Structure and Pacing

**Bunching Clues at End:**

Plant throughout. Even distribution maintains engagement.

**Poor Pacing:**

- Too fast: mystery solved too easily
- Too slow: reader loses interest
- Need ebb and flow

### Fair Play Violations

**Arbitrary Suspect Selection:**

Setting up suspects then randomly picking one. Solution must logically follow evidence.

**Detective Knowledge Without Discovery:**

Detective suddenly knows things without learning them.

**Clues From Thin Air:**

Evidence appearing without prior establishment breaks reader contract.

### Research Errors

**Lack of Research:**

- Police procedures must be accurate
- Forensic details matter
- Don't rely on TV shows

**Stupid Detectives:**

Making trained detectives miss obvious things frustrates readers.

### Plot Holes

- Timeline inconsistencies
- Character capability mismatches
- Unexplained evidence
- Red herrings never resolved
- Suspicious behavior never accounted for
