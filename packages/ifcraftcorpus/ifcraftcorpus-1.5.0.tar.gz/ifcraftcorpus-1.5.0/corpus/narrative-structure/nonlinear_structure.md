# Nonlinear and Alternative Structures

Craft guidance for non-chronological storytelling and alternative narrative frameworks—from Western time jumps to Eastern structural patterns.

---

## Time Jumps & Chronology

### Core Principle

Time jumps represent event boundaries. A larger jump corresponds to a larger shift in narrative context. These shifts must be deliberate and serve the story, not novelty. Even when bouncing around in time, emotional stakes should escalate regardless of chronology.

### Concrete Techniques

**Clear Temporal Markers:**

- Chapter labels: "10 years earlier" or "5 months later"
- Date stamps in chapter headings
- Visual formatting cues (page breaks, typography changes)

**Anchor with Objects:**
Use objects to signal time shifts—a character touching a photograph triggers a memory. A character touching a scar in both timelines links them without explanation.

**In Medias Res:**
Opening "into the middle of things"—beginning in the chronological middle rather than at the beginning.

- Open with immediate tension or conflict.
- Bypass superfluous exposition initially.
- Fill in backstory gradually and organically.

**Reverse Chronology:**
"Untelling"—events unfold backward in time. Starting with the conclusion and tracing steps that led there. Effective for themes of inevitability or memory (e.g., *Memento*).

## Parallel Narratives

### Core Principle

**Write interleaved, not separate.** It's nearly impossible to avoid a "silo feeling" if you write two stories separately then weave them together. Write your timelines already interleaved, with an alternating story unfurling as one.

### Structural Approaches

**Alternating Chapters:**
Most common. One chapter for Timeline A, next for Timeline B. Creates a consistent rhythm.

**Braided Structure:**
Weave back and forth between timelines within chapters for tighter integration.

**Thematic Parallels:**
Explore similar themes or motifs across seemingly unrelated plots.

### The Zapping System (Scenario Interlocking)

A mechanic where actions in Character A's route affect the world state in Character B's route.

- *Example:* A unlocks a door; B can now pass through it later.
- *Example:* *Resident Evil 2*, *13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim*.

## Eastern Narrative Structures

### Kishōtenketsu (Introduction, Development, Twist, Conclusion)

Origin: Chinese/Japanese poetry and narrative.

- **Ki (Introduction):** Introduce characters and setting.
- **Shō (Development):** Deepen the introduction. No major changes, just expansion.
- **Ten (Twist/Complication):** A surprising element is introduced. *Not* necessarily a conflict, but a recontextualization.
- **Ketsu (Conclusion):** Bringing Ki/Sho and Ten together.

**Contrast with Western 3-Act:**
Western structure relies on **Conflict** and **Resolution**. Kishōtenketsu relies on **Juxtaposition** and **Harmony**.

- *IF Application:* Slice-of-life stories, horror (where the "Twist" recontextualizes safety into danger), and surreal narratives.

### Jo-ha-kyū (Beginning, Break, Rapid)

Origin: Japanese Noh theatre. Pacing structure.

- **Jo:** Slow, gradual beginning. Gathering potential.
- **Ha:** The break/cracking. Tempo increases. Action occurs.
- **Kyū:** Rapid, short conclusion.

- *IF Application:* Designing the pacing of a single scene or a combat encounter. Start slow, complicate, finish fast.

## Cyclical and Loop Structures

### The Time Loop

The player repeats the same time period, gaining "Knowledge" (Meta-currency) to unlock new paths.

- *Pattern:* `Fail -> Restart -> Use Knowledge -> Progress further -> Fail`.
- *Key:* The player remembers, but the characters (usually) do not.
- *Example:* *Outer Wilds*, *Majora's Mask*.

### The Rashomon Effect

The same event told from multiple contradictory perspectives.

- *Mechanic:* Player plays as Character A, then B, then C.
- *Goal:* The "Truth" is synthesized by the player, rarely explicitly stated by the game.

---

## Database Narrative / Environmental Storytelling

### Narrative as Database

Instead of a linear path, the story is a collection of fragments (logs, items, memories) scattered in a space.

- **Player Agency:** The *order* of discovery creates the meaning.
- **Structure:** No fixed "Beginning" or "Middle". The "End" triggers when a threshold of understanding is reached.
- *Example:* *Her Story*, *Dark Souls* lore, *Gone Home*.

---

## Reader Orientation

### Core Principle

Mystery is fuel, but confusion is friction. Offer cues and closure while leaving space for debate.

### Signaling Techniques

**Visual and Formatting:**

- Consistent chapter titles ("Then" vs "Now")
- Different formatting for different timelines (Italics for past, etc.)

**Symbolic Anchors:**

- Repeated images, phrases, or actions across timelines.
- Objects that trigger memories or signal shifts.

**Narrative Continuity:**

- Same protagonist throughout (or clear handoff).
- Same setting across timelines.
