# Science Fiction Conventions for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing science fiction—subgenres, managing scale, technology consistency, and handling exposition.

---

## Sci-Fi Subgenres

### Hard Science Fiction

**Core Conventions:**

- Adherence to known scientific laws (physics, biology, astronomy)
- Speculation grounded in plausible extrapolation
- Focus on technical details and problem-solving
- Minimal "hand-waving" of impossible tech (FTL, gravity)

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Puzzles based on real logic/physics
- "Show your work" in solutions
- Failure states often result from ignoring scientific reality

### Space Opera

**Core Conventions:**

- Grand scale (interstellar/galactic)
- Romantic, melodramatic adventure
- "Soft" science (FTL is given, artificial gravity is magic)
- Focus on politics, war, and character drama
- Distinct alien cultures

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Faction systems and reputation tracking
- Crew management mechanics
- Travel across vast distances (star maps)

### Cyberpunk

**Core Conventions:**

- "High tech, low life"
- Near-future dystopian urban settings
- Fusion of human and machine (cybernetics)
- Corporate dominance over government
- Themes of identity, consciousness, and inequality

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Hacking minigames or text-based netrunning
- Body modification choices (stats vs humanity)
- Moral ambiguity (working for corps vs resistance)

### Post-Apocalyptic

**Core Conventions:**

- Collapse of civilization (nuclear, biological, environmental)
- Scarcity of resources
- Survival focus
- Exploration of human nature in extremis

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Inventory management (food, water, ammo)
- Crafting systems
- Brutal moral choices (who eats?)

## The Scale Problem

### Planetary vs. Galactic

**Planetary Scale:**

- One world, detailed ecosystem
- Travel is physical and time-consuming
- Deep cultural dive

**Galactic Scale:**

- Many worlds, shallow ecosystems ("The Ice Planet", "The Jungle Planet")
- Travel is narrative punctuation
- Broad political landscape

### Handling Distance and Time

**Relativistic Travel:**

- Time dilation (thousands of years pass on Earth while crew ages months)
- Communication lag
- "Message in a bottle" storytelling

**FTL (Faster Than Light):**

- Warp/Hyperlanes: Instant or fast travel
- Gates: Fixed points of travel
- Needs consistent rules (fuel, recharge, routes)

## Technology and Consistency

### Clarke's Third Law

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

**But in Sci-Fi, it must HAVE rules.**

### Technobabble

**The Good:**

- Consistent terminology
- Rooted in real concepts (quantum, nanotech)
- Used sparingly to flavor, not explain everything

**The Bad:**

- "Reversing the polarity" to solve any problem
- Inconsistent terms for same tech
- Explaining things the characters would take for granted

**Guideline:** Characters shouldn't explain how a toaster works while making toast. Only explain tech if it's broken, new, or the solution to a puzzle.

### The Novum (New Thing)

Sci-Fi usually introduces a "Novum"—a scientifically plausible innovation that changes reality.

- **One Big Lie:** Accept one impossible thing (e.g., Time Travel) and strictly follow its consequences.
- **Ripple Effects:** If teleportation exists, how does it change shipping? Borders? Privacy?

## Interactive Fiction Considerations

### The "Datapad" Trope

**Usage:**

- Collecting lore/logs found in environment.
- Efficient way to deliver backstory without dialogue dumps.

**Risk:**

- Becomes a "reading assignment" stopping gameplay.
- **Fix:** Make logs actionable (contain codes, passwords, map coordinates).

### AI Companions

**Functions:**

- Hint system (diegetic)
- Exposition delivery
- Hacking/Technical tool

**Characterization:**

- Avoid "Robot who wants to be human" cliché unless subverting it.
- Explore alien logic/values.

### Interface as Narrative

In Sci-Fi IF, the UI itself can be diegetic.

- The text *is* the terminal.
- Glitches, corrupted text, and system warnings enhance immersion.

---

## Common Mistakes

### The "Planet of Hats"

Alien races where everyone shares the same single personality trait/job (The Warrior Race, The Merchant Race).
**Fix:** Show factions and dissent within alien cultures.

### Dates That Age Poorly

Setting the story in "2030" with flying cars.
**Fix:** Use relative dates ("20 years after the Event") or far future.

### Ignoring Linguistics

Universal Translators are convenient but erase cultural friction.
**Fix:** Use language barriers as puzzles or character building.

## Quick Reference

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Subgenre | Define early (Hard vs Soft) to set player expectations |
| Technobabble | Use for flavor, not deus ex machina solutions |
| Aliens | Avoid monolith cultures ("Planet of Hats") |
| Scale | Respect travel times and distances |
| UI | Use diegetic interfaces (terminals, logs) |
