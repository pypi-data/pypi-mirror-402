# Conflict Patterns for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for creating and managing conflict—types, escalation, resolution, and the relationship between struggle and character growth.

---

## Internal vs External Conflict

### The Two Battlefields

Every compelling story operates on two fronts:

- **External conflict:** Character vs outside forces (antagonists, nature, society)
- **Internal conflict:** Character vs self (fears, desires, beliefs, identity)

The richest narratives interweave both. External challenges force internal reckonings. Internal growth enables external victories.

### Balancing Internal and External

Pure external conflict feels shallow—action without meaning. Pure internal conflict feels static—navel-gazing without stakes. The balance depends on genre and tone, but both should be present.

> External: She must escape the burning building.
> Internal: She must overcome her paralysis—the last fire took everything from her.
> Interweaving: Each floor she climbs forces her to confront memories while smoke fills her lungs.

### The Mirror Principle

Design external conflicts that mirror internal ones:

- A character who can't trust faces a partner whose loyalty is uncertain
- A character afraid of commitment faces a choice with permanent consequences
- A character who believes they're worthless faces a situation where only they can help

### Interactive Considerations

In interactive fiction, player choices often resolve external conflicts. The internal dimension comes from how those choices are framed and what they cost emotionally.

## Types of Conflict

### Person vs Person

Direct opposition between characters. The classic antagonist relationship.

**Variations:**

- Hero vs Villain (clear opposition)
- Rivals (competing for same goal)
- Allies in disagreement (same side, different methods)
- Betrayal (trust violated)

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Both parties have understandable motivations
- The antagonist believes they're right
- The conflict isn't easily resolvable through conversation

### Person vs Nature

Characters struggle against environmental forces. Survival stories, disaster narratives, exploration tales.

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Nature is indifferent, not malicious
- Human error often contributes to danger
- Victory means survival, not defeating nature
- Hubris is punished; respect and adaptation succeed

### Person vs Society

Characters oppose institutions, cultural norms, or collective belief.

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Society isn't monolithic—show varied opinions
- Some members of society sympathize with the protagonist
- The system has inertia; change is slow and costly
- Personal stakes connect to systemic issues

### Person vs Technology

Characters struggle with tools that have unintended consequences, AI that exceeds parameters, or dependence that becomes vulnerability.

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Technology reflects human choices—someone made it this way
- The technology works as designed; the design is the problem
- Solutions often require human connection, not better technology

### Person vs Supernatural/Fate

Characters oppose forces beyond normal understanding. Prophecy, curses, divine intervention, cosmic horror.

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Establish rules for the supernatural (even if mysterious)
- Human agency must still matter
- Victory often means acceptance or redefinition, not defeat of the force

### Person vs Self

Pure internal conflict. Addiction, trauma, identity crisis, moral struggle.

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Externalize through behavior—show the struggle
- Progress isn't linear; setbacks feel authentic
- Resolution requires genuine change, not just decision

## Escalation Arcs

### The Stakes Ladder

Conflicts must escalate. Each confrontation should raise stakes higher than the last. Without escalation, stories plateau and readers disengage.

**Escalation dimensions:**

- **Scope:** Personal → local → global
- **Consequences:** Inconvenience → loss → death
- **Difficulty:** Easy choices → impossible choices
- **Investment:** Strangers at risk → loved ones at risk → self at risk

### The Try-Fail Cycle

Characters should fail before they succeed. Each failure raises stakes and reveals new information.

1. Character tries obvious solution → fails
2. Character tries harder/smarter solution → fails, but learns something
3. Character tries unconventional solution → fails, but gets closer
4. Character synthesizes learning into final approach → succeeds (or fails meaningfully)

### Avoiding Plateau

Signs your conflict has plateaued:

- Same type of challenge repeating
- Stakes haven't increased in several scenes
- Antagonist isn't responding to protagonist's actions
- Resolution seems equally possible now as three chapters ago

### False Victories and True Setbacks

Escalation includes reversals:

- **False victory:** Protagonist thinks they've won, then discovers the real threat
- **True setback:** Protagonist loses something that can't be recovered
- **Pyrrhic victory:** Protagonist wins but at terrible cost

### Interactive Escalation

In branching narratives, each path should escalate appropriately. Avoid paths that plateau while others intensify. Player choices should affect which dimension escalates—scope vs personal stakes, for example.

## Resolution Patterns

### Earned vs Unearned Resolution

Resolution feels earned when:

- The seeds were planted earlier (foreshadowing)
- The character changed in ways that enabled the resolution
- The solution arose from established rules and character knowledge
- Something was sacrificed to achieve it

Resolution feels unearned when:

- New information arrives conveniently at the climax
- A character gains sudden abilities
- The antagonist makes inexplicable errors
- External forces intervene (deus ex machina)

### Types of Resolution

**Victory:** Protagonist overcomes antagonist/obstacle directly.

**Synthesis:** Protagonist finds third option that transcends original conflict.

**Sacrifice:** Protagonist wins by giving up something precious.

**Acceptance:** Protagonist cannot defeat the force but finds peace with it.

**Tragedy:** Protagonist fails, but their failure has meaning or consequence.

**Transformation:** The conflict itself changes—what seemed the problem wasn't the real problem.

### The Emotional Resolution

External conflict resolution is not the same as emotional resolution. A character might defeat the villain but still struggle with internal conflict. Or resolve internal conflict despite external failure.

Plan both arcs and their relationship:

> External: She saves the village. (victory)
> Internal: She realizes she doesn't need their approval. (transformation)
> Or alternatively:
> External: The village is destroyed. (tragedy)
> Internal: She learns she can survive loss. (acceptance)

### Interactive Resolution

In interactive fiction, multiple valid resolutions should exist. Different paths lead to different ending types. The key is ensuring all endings feel earned within their path's logic.

## Layered Conflict

### Simultaneous Struggles

Complex narratives maintain multiple conflicts simultaneously at different scales:

- **Global:** The war threatens the kingdom
- **Local:** The town is caught between armies
- **Interpersonal:** Two leaders disagree on strategy
- **Personal:** The protagonist must choose between duty and love
- **Internal:** The protagonist questions whether they're capable

### Conflict Interaction

Layered conflicts should affect each other:

> The interpersonal conflict between leaders (they don't trust each other) affects the local conflict (the town gets contradictory orders) which affects the personal conflict (the protagonist must navigate both) which affects the internal conflict (who is right? can anyone be trusted?).

### Primary and Secondary Conflicts

One conflict drives the main plot. Others complicate it. The primary conflict gets the climax; secondary conflicts resolve before or after, or become absorbed into the primary.

### Rotating Foreground

Different scenes can foreground different conflicts. A scene of war strategy foregrounds global conflict. A scene of argument foregrounds interpersonal conflict. A scene of doubt foregrounds internal conflict. All remain active; attention shifts.

## Conflict and Character Growth

### Conflict Reveals Character

How characters respond to conflict shows who they really are. Pressure strips away pretense. Actions under stress define character more than actions in comfort.

> "You want to know who someone really is? Watch what they do when they're afraid."

### Conflict Changes Character

By story's end, characters should be different because of what they've endured. The conflict demanded growth, and they grew—or failed to.

**Growth patterns:**

- Gaining capability (learning to fight, lead, survive)
- Gaining wisdom (understanding something they didn't)
- Gaining connection (forming bonds through shared struggle)
- Losing illusion (confronting truth they'd avoided)
- Choosing identity (deciding who they want to be)

### The Character Arc-Conflict Connection

Design conflicts that force specific growth:

| Character Flaw | Conflict Type | Growth Opportunity |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cowardice | Must protect others | Discover courage |
| Arrogance | Outmatched opponent | Learn humility |
| Isolation | Require teamwork | Accept connection |
| Distrust | Must rely on suspect ally | Learn to trust |
| Self-doubt | Solo challenge | Discover capability |

### Failure as Growth

Not all conflict ends in victory. Characters who fail can still grow—sometimes more meaningfully. The failed hero who learns from defeat, who keeps trying, who finds meaning despite failure—this arc resonates deeply.

---

## Common Mistakes

### Conflict Without Stakes

Fighting without clear consequences. Ask: what happens if the protagonist loses? If the answer is "nothing much," stakes are too low.

### Solvable Through Conversation

If the conflict could be resolved by characters talking honestly for five minutes, it's not a real conflict. Ensure genuine obstacles to resolution exist.

### Antagonist Stupidity

Villains who make inexplicable errors to let heroes win. Antagonists should be competent, even brilliant. Their defeat should feel earned, not gifted.

### Monotone Conflict

Every scene has the same type of conflict at the same intensity. Vary conflict types and intensities. Follow high-intensity scenes with lower-intensity scenes that still contain tension.

### Forgotten Conflicts

Conflicts introduced then never resolved. Track every conflict thread and ensure resolution or deliberate ambiguity.
