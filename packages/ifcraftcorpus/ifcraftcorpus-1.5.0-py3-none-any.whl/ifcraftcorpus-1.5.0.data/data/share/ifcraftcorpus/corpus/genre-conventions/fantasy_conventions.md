# Fantasy Genre Conventions for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing fantasy—subgenres, magic systems, worldbuilding tropes, character archetypes, and quest structures.

---

## Fantasy Subgenres

### High Fantasy (Epic Fantasy)

**Core Conventions:**

- Secondary worlds with their own physical laws
- Grand scale plots with world-threatening conflicts
- Clear moral cosmology (good vs evil, order vs chaos)
- Extensive worldbuilding with histories, cultures, languages
- Long-form storytelling (trilogy or series format)

**Reader Expectations:**

- Complex magic systems integrated into society
- Political intrigue at kingdom or world level
- Multiple POV characters across the conflict
- High stakes affecting entire civilizations

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Players expect meaningful choices affecting factions
- World state should reflect political consequences
- Epic scope requires careful state management
- Multiple storylines tracking different regions

### Urban Fantasy

**Core Conventions:**

- Contemporary real-world settings with magical elements
- Present-day urban environments
- Supernatural creatures hidden in mundane world
- Borrowed noir and procedural conventions
- Secret magical societies maintaining "the masquerade"

**Key Elements:**

- Vampires, werewolves, demons, mages coexisting
- Mystery/investigation plot structures
- Romantic subplots frequently featured
- First-person perspectives common

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Choices often involve "reveal magic or maintain cover"
- Relationship systems with mundane and supernatural NPCs
- Investigation mechanics requiring clue gathering
- Moral choices about using power in modern contexts

### Dark Fantasy

**Core Conventions:**

- Blends fantasy with horror elements
- Supernatural rooted in terror and evil
- Morally gray or dark protagonists
- Gothic or Victorian aesthetics
- Grim, nihilistic worldviews

**Tone Requirements:**

- Aims to unnerve and frighten
- Consequences severe and often permanent
- No guaranteed happy endings
- Psychological horror elements

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Choices should have genuinely disturbing consequences
- Sanity/corruption mechanics fit well
- Death and failure states feel meaningful
- Subvert darkness by offering genuine hope

### Sword and Sorcery

**Core Conventions:**

- Action-oriented personal battles
- Protagonists are outsiders, mercenaries, drifters
- Self-interested heroes motivated by survival or profit
- Immediate, visceral prose style
- Pulp magazine roots (fast-paced, less contemplative)

**Protagonist Types:**

- Larger-than-life action heroes
- Motivated by money, survival, revenge
- Skilled warriors or rogues
- No grand destiny—just survival

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Combat should feel consequential and dangerous
- Reward player cleverness and pragmatism
- Moral choices without clear "good" options
- Short-term goals rather than world-saving quests

### Fairy Tale Fantasy

**Core Conventions:**

- Familiar story structures (transformation, curses, true love)
- Clear moral lessons or transformations
- Magical thinking and symbolic logic
- "Rule of three" patterns
- Talking animals, enchanted objects, wishes
- Bargains, tests, and trials

**Interactive Fiction Implications:**

- Player choices should feel like "tests of character"
- Consequences can be symbolic or literal
- Bargain mechanics (be careful what you wish for)
- Repetition with variation (three chances, three trials)

## Magic System Design

### Sanderson's Laws

**First Law: Solve Problems Proportionally**

> "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."

**Application:**

- If magic will solve problems, explain it first
- Soft magic creates wonder but can't resolve conflicts
- Hard magic enables problem-solving and prediction
- Avoid deus ex machina by establishing rules early

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Players need to understand magic to make informed choices
- Magic choices should feel like skill, not guesswork
- Establish limits before presenting magic-based puzzles

**Second Law: Limitations Over Powers**

> "It's more interesting to know what powers CAN'T do than what they CAN do."

**Three Constraint Types:**

- **Limitations:** What magic cannot accomplish
- **Weaknesses:** What enemies can exploit
- **Costs:** What you sacrifice for power

**Benefits:**

- Creates tension and drama
- Forces creative problem-solving
- Prevents power escalation problems

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Resource management (mana, stamina, sanity)
- Meaningful tradeoffs in magical choices
- Weaknesses players must work around

**Third Law: Expand Before Adding**

> "Expand what you already have before adding something new."

**Principle:**

- Deep, interconnected systems beat wide, shallow ones
- Each magic type affects the entire world
- Consider societal implications of magical capabilities

**Questions to Ask:**

- If magic creates food, why do people farm?
- If magic heals, how do plagues affect society?
- If magic kills easily, why use conventional weapons?

### Hard vs Soft Magic

**Soft Magic:**

- Rules deliberately obscure
- Creates sense of wonder and mystery
- Best for atmosphere and spectacle
- Should NOT solve plot problems

**Hard Magic:**

- Rules clearly explained and consistent
- Readers can predict outcomes
- Enables puzzle-solving and strategy
- Magic becomes a tool to master

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Hard magic works better for puzzle/strategy choices
- Soft magic works better for atmospheric exploration
- Mix both: player powers hard, mysterious forces soft

## Worldbuilding Tropes

### Using Tropes Effectively

Tropes aren't enemies—they exist because they resonate emotionally. The challenge is using them thoughtfully.

**Why Tropes Work:**

- Readers enjoy predictability and comfort
- Familiar patterns create narrative shorthand
- Expectations enable meaningful subversion

### Common Fantasy Tropes

**The Medieval European Default:**

- Pseudo-medieval technology
- Feudal political structures
- Castles, knights, peasants

**When to use:** Readers understand the social dynamics.
**When to subvert:** Explore non-European cultures, different tech levels.

**Ancient Lost Civilization:**

- Ruins holding advanced magic/technology
- Forgotten knowledge to rediscover
- Warnings from the past ignored

**The Dark Forest:**

- Dangerous wilderness between civilizations
- Monsters make travel perilous
- Justifies isolated communities

**Homogeneous Cultures:**

- All elves live in forests
- All dwarves mine mountains

**Problem:** Reduces cultures to stereotypes.
**Fix:** Show diversity within cultures, mixed communities.

### Strategies for Trope Use

**Establish Then Subvert:**

Introduce familiar elements so readers form expectations, then introduce twists.

**Character-Driven Subversion:**

Let character flaws, fears, or growth drive unexpected outcomes.

**Honor Emotional Truth:**

Understand WHY the trope resonates, then fulfill that emotional contract in fresh ways.

**Methods of Subversion:**

- Inversion (flip roles)
- Deconstruction (examine consequences)
- Genre hybridization
- Context shifting

## Character Archetypes

### The Chosen One

**Traditional Pattern:**

- Destined to complete important task
- Identified through prophecy or lineage
- Often unaware of abilities initially
- Reluctant hero accepting destiny

**Modern Subversions:**

- Chosen one narrative is manipulation
- Wrong person was chosen
- Chosen one rejects destiny
- Multiple "chosen ones" in conflict
- Burden causes trauma/resentment

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Player agency conflicts with predetermined destiny
- Let players explore "what if chosen one failed?"
- Treat prophecy as probability, not certainty

### The Mentor

**Traditional Pattern:**

- Source of knowledge, wisdom, training
- Guides but doesn't complete journey
- Often dies or departs before climax
- Provides crucial tools or gifts

**Subversions:**

- Mentor has ulterior motives
- Mentor is learning alongside student
- Mentor is wrong about crucial things
- Multiple mentors with conflicting advice

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Mentor relationships affected by choices
- Option to reject mentor's teachings
- Moral choices: follow path or forge your own?

### The Dark Lord

**Traditional Pattern:**

- Ultimate antagonist
- Desires power, control, destruction
- Distant threat for most of story
- Final confrontation at climax

**Effective Villain Motivations:**

- Personal vendetta with legitimate grievance
- "Doing evil for good reasons"
- Traumatic backstory explaining actions
- Dark mirror of hero's potential

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Player might discover villain's perspective
- Choices allowing sympathy or understanding
- Possible redemption arcs based on actions

## Quest Structures

### The Hero's Journey

**Three-Act Pattern:**

**Act 1: Departure**

1. Ordinary World
2. Call to Adventure
3. Refusal of the Call
4. Meeting the Mentor
5. Crossing the Threshold

**Act 2: Initiation**

6. Tests, Allies, Enemies
7. Approach to Innermost Cave
8. Ordeal
9. Reward

**Act 3: Return**

10. The Road Back
11. Resurrection
12. Return with Elixir

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Structure accommodates branching
- Player choices determine which tests, allies
- Multiple possible ordeals based on build
- "Return with Elixir" varies by playthrough

### Prophecy in Fantasy

**Types:**

- Self-fulfilling (becomes true because believed)
- Conditional (will happen unless/if X)
- Inevitable (no way to prevent)
- Vague (multiple interpretations)
- False (manipulation or misunderstanding)

**Subversions:**

- Prophecy was metaphorical
- Applies to unexpected person
- Prophecy is propaganda
- Comes true unexpectedly
- Rejecting destiny has consequences

**For Interactive Fiction:**

- Prophecy as constraint vs player agency
- Let players interpret differently
- Accuracy based on player choices
- False prophecies as misdirection

## Common Pitfalls

### Info Dumps

**The Problem:** Stopping story to explain world.

**Solutions:**

- **Iceberg Method:** Show 10%, imply 90%
- **Character Integration:** Filter through perspective
- **Delayed Revelation:** Slice lore across scenes
- **Show Through Consequence:** Don't explain—show results

**Good Example:**

> The ancient crown bore notches from seven blades—one for each tribe that had knelt.

**Bad Example:**

> "The Kingdom of Valdris was founded in the Third Age by King Aldric the Conqueror, who united the seven warring tribes..."

### Made-Up Words Overload

**Problems:**

- Unpronounceable consonant clusters
- Apostrophe abuse
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Similar-sounding names

**Best Practices:**

- Create consistent sound patterns per culture
- Say names aloud—if you stumble, readers will too
- Keep frequently used names short
- Don't rename everything—"horse" doesn't need new name

### Inconsistent Power Levels

**Common Errors:**

- Magic fails conveniently for plot
- Characters forget demonstrated abilities
- Power scales shift between scenes
- Rules apply differently to heroes vs villains

**Solutions:**

- List all character abilities explicitly
- Define costs, limitations, failure conditions
- Track energy expenditure across scenes
- Verify magical rules apply universally

### The Idiot Ball

**The Problem:** Smart characters act stupidly for plot convenience.

**Fix:** Give actual reasons characters can't take obvious action:

- Time pressure
- Missing information
- Character flaw
- External constraint
- Reasonable miscalculation

## Interactive Fiction Considerations

### Delayed Branching

Early choices don't branch immediately but affect later scenes.

**Example:**

- Chapter 1: Choose "Brutality" or "Finesse"
- Chapter 5: Face heroes in combat
  - Brutality path: win fair duel
  - Finesse path: lose duel but can set trap

**Benefits:**

- Stories can be longer
- Choices feel meaningful
- Content requirements manageable

### Player Agency vs Narrative

**Solutions:**

- Destiny through interpretation (prophecy says what, player chooses how)
- Constrained choice (fixed plot points, varied approach)
- Consequence variation (same events, different meanings)
- Multiple valid endings
- Failure states with continuation

### Diegetic Choice Presentation

**Bad (game-speak):**

> [ATTACK] [DEFEND] [USE MAGIC]

**Good (world-grounded):**

> Draw your sword and charge
> Raise your shield and wait
> Speak the fire-words
