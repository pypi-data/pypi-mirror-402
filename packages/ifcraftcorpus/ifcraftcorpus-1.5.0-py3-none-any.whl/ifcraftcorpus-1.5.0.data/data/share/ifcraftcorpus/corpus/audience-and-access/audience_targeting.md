# Audience Targeting for Interactive Fiction

Craft guidance for writing interactive fiction for different age groups—vocabulary, themes, complexity, and content appropriateness.

---

## Age Group Categories

### Overview

Different audiences require different approaches. What works for adults may confuse children; what engages teens may bore adults. Understanding your target audience shapes every writing decision.

| Category | Ages | Reading Level | Session Length |
|----------|------|---------------|----------------|
| Early Readers | 5–7 | Grades K–2 | 5–10 min |
| Middle Grade | 8–12 | Grades 3–6 | 15–30 min |
| Young Adult | 13–17 | Grades 7–12 | 30–60 min |
| New Adult | 18–25 | Adult | 30–90 min |
| Adult | 18+ | Adult | Variable |
| All Ages | Variable | Accessible | Variable |

---

## Early Readers (Ages 5–7)

### Vocabulary

- **Word length:** 1–2 syllables preferred
- **Vocabulary:** Common, concrete words
- **Avoid:** Abstract concepts, idioms, figurative language
- **Repetition:** Key words can repeat for reinforcement

### Sentence Structure

- **Length:** 5–10 words per sentence
- **Structure:** Simple sentences (subject-verb-object)
- **Avoid:** Complex clauses, passive voice
- **One idea per sentence**

Example:
> Good: "The dog ran fast. It jumped over the log."
>
> Bad: "The canine, having been startled by the noise, proceeded to traverse the fallen timber."

### Themes

- **Appropriate:** Friendship, family, animals, simple adventures, feelings
- **Handling conflict:** Problems resolve quickly and clearly
- **Emotions:** Name them explicitly ("Sam felt happy")
- **Lessons:** Clear but not preachy

### Content Boundaries

- **Violence:** Slapstick okay, no real harm
- **Fear:** Mild scares that resolve safely
- **Death:** Generally avoid; if present, handle gently
- **Romance:** Not applicable

### Choice Design

- **2 choices maximum** per decision
- **Clear consequences** visible in choice text
- **No wrong choices** that lead to failure states
- **Visual distinction** between options helpful

---

## Middle Grade (Ages 8–12)

### Vocabulary

- **Word length:** 2–3 syllables comfortable
- **Vocabulary:** Expanding; can introduce new words in context
- **Allow:** Some figurative language, simple idioms
- **Define:** Unusual words through context

### Sentence Structure

- **Length:** 10–20 words typical
- **Structure:** Compound sentences okay
- **Allow:** Some complexity, varied structures
- **Maintain:** Clear cause-and-effect logic

### Themes

- **Appropriate:** Adventure, mystery, friendship, school, family dynamics, self-discovery, light fantasy/sci-fi
- **Handling conflict:** Can be more complex; resolution may require effort
- **Emotions:** Can explore nuance ("confused," "disappointed")
- **Agency:** Protagonists solve their own problems

### Content Boundaries

- **Violence:** Action adventure okay; no graphic descriptions
- **Fear:** Genuine stakes acceptable; villains can be scary
- **Death:** Can occur (often pets, grandparents); handle with care
- **Romance:** Crushes okay; nothing physical beyond hand-holding

### Choice Design

- **3–4 choices** comfortable
- **Consequences** can be delayed and complex
- **Some wrong choices** acceptable (learning opportunities)
- **Stats/tracking** can be introduced simply

## Young Adult (Ages 13–17)

### Vocabulary

- **Full range:** No vocabulary restrictions
- **Allow:** Slang, technical terms, sophisticated language
- **Match:** Character voice to character age
- **Avoid:** Condescension

### Sentence Structure

- **Full complexity:** Match adult prose
- **Vary:** Length and structure for effect
- **Allow:** Stylistic experimentation

### Themes

- **Central themes:** Identity, belonging, first love, independence, challenging authority, finding purpose
- **Handling conflict:** Complex moral situations; no easy answers
- **Emotions:** Full emotional range; intensity appropriate
- **Agency:** Teen protagonists with real power over outcomes

### Content Boundaries

- **Violence:** Can be present; avoid gratuitous gore
- **Fear:** Full horror elements acceptable
- **Death:** Can be significant and impactful
- **Romance:** Can include relationships; physical intimacy typically stops at kissing/implied

### Choice Design

- **Full complexity** acceptable
- **Moral ambiguity** in choices
- **Long-term consequences**
- **Character customization** engaging for this age

### YA-Specific Considerations

- **Authenticity:** Teens detect condescension instantly
- **Voice:** Strong, distinctive first-person often works well
- **Adults:** Often absent, ineffective, or antagonistic
- **Stakes:** Feel life-or-death (even when they're not)

## Reading Level Metrics

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

Estimates US grade level needed to understand text.

| Target Audience | FK Grade Level |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Early Readers | 1–2 |
| Middle Grade | 3–6 |
| Young Adult | 7–10 |
| Adult (accessible) | 8–10 |
| Adult (literary) | 10–14+ |

### Flesch Reading Ease

Score from 0–100 (higher = easier).

| Score | Readability |
|-------|-------------|
| 90–100 | Very easy (age 5–7) |
| 80–89 | Easy (age 8–10) |
| 70–79 | Fairly easy (age 11–13) |
| 60–69 | Standard (age 14–16) |
| 50–59 | Fairly difficult (age 17–18) |

### Using Metrics

- **Don't obsess:** Metrics are guides, not rules
- **Check samples:** Test representative passages
- **Balance:** Complex vocabulary + simple sentences can work
- **Story first:** Never sacrifice story for score

## Common Mistakes

### Writing Down

Simplifying vocabulary while keeping adult concepts. Children don't need "dumbed down" content—they need age-appropriate content.

Bad:
> "The man did a bad thing and felt sad about it."

The problem isn't the words—it's forcing adult moral complexity into simple language.

### Writing Up

Using child protagonists but adult themes/complexity. Age of protagonist should match content maturity.

### Inconsistent Register

Mixing reading levels within a piece. Stay consistent with your target audience throughout.

### Moralizing

Especially in children's content: lessons that interrupt story, characters who exist to teach. Story first; meaning emerges naturally.

### Underestimating Young Readers

Children handle more complexity than adults assume. Middle-graders can grasp sophisticated plots. YA readers want genuine stakes.

### Ignoring Parent Gatekeepers

For content targeting minors, parents often make purchasing decisions. Consider what parents want for their children alongside what children want.

---

## All-Ages Content

### The Challenge

Writing for everyone means satisfying no one perfectly. All-ages content works by layering.

### Layered Approach

- **Surface story:** Engaging for youngest audience
- **Deeper meaning:** Rewards older/repeat readers
- **Humor:** Works on multiple levels
- **References:** Some for kids, some for adults

### Examples That Work

Pixar films demonstrate this well: engaging stories for children with emotional depth and humor adults appreciate. The same approach works for IF.

### What to Avoid

- Content that only works for one age group
- "Inside jokes" that alienate part of audience
- Themes too mature for children, too simple for adults

## Quick Reference

| Audience | Vocabulary | Sentence Length | Choices | Content Limits |
|----------|------------|-----------------|---------|----------------|

| Middle Grade | Expanding | 10–20 words | 3–4 | PG equivalent |
| Young Adult | Full | Full | Full | PG-13 equivalent |
| Adult | Full | Full | Full | Content warnings |
