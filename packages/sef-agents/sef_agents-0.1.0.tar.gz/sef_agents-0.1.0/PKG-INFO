**AI-Powered Guidance for the Synchronous Engineering Framework**

SEF Agents provides agent-based AI guidance, codebase mapping, and quality enforcement for the Synchronous Engineering Framework (SEF).

> *Built on [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for universal AI assistant compatibility.*

## What This Does

SEF Agents is an **MCP server** that connects to your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf). Once connected, it provides:

1. **Agent-based prompts** — Specialized guidance for 13 agents (10 SDLC + 3 utility)
2. **Quality enforcement tools** — Scan code for compliance, debt, security
3. **Workflow orchestration** — Track story state, dependencies, handoffs

**Important:** This is not a standalone app. It requires an MCP-compatible AI assistant.

---

## Features

### Agent-Based Guidance (13 Agents)

#### SDLC Workflow Agents (10)

| Agent | Function |

| `qa_lead` | Validates AC *before* development begins |
| `architect` | System design, boundaries, integration points |
| `developer` | Elite Code Quality Protocol enforcement |
| `tester` | Test standards, real-execution tests |
| `pr_reviewer` | PR review, AI anti-pattern detection |
| `scrum_master` | Process orchestration, handoff tracking |
| `security_owner` | Security audit, vulnerability scanning |
| `test_designer` | Conceptual test design, BDD architecture |

#### Utility Agents (3) — On-Demand

| Agent | Function |
|------|----------|
| `forensic_engineer` | Incident investigation, 5 Whys, post-mortems |
| `strategist` | Solution brainstorming, trade-off analysis |
| `platform_engineer` | DevEx, health scanning, code quality enforcement |

### Quality Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `generate_codemap` | Auto-document directory structure |
| `validate_compliance` | Check code against SEF standards |
| `detect_ai_patterns` | Find AI-generated code smells |
| `scan_debt` | Detect technical debt (TODOs, bare exceptions, etc.) |
| `scan_external_dependencies` | Find env vars, API clients, external URLs |
| `scan_code_quality` | AST-based pe_rules enforcement (bare except, types, logging) |
| `scan_health` | Unified health report across all quality dimensions |

### Workflow Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `init_workflow` | Start tracking a story |
| `get_workflow_state` | See current phase, blockers, artifacts |
| `suggest_next_agent` | Auto-suggest agent transitions |
| `generate_story_dependency_graph` | Visualize story dependencies |
| `detect_flow_gaps` | Find broken E2E flows |

## Security

SEF Agents is designed with security as a core principle:

- ✅ **No Network Calls**: Contains no HTTP clients, sockets, or external communication
- ✅ **No Data Exfiltration**: All operations are local-only
- ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Scanned for credentials and API keys
- ✅ **Audited Dependencies**: All dependencies use permissive OSS licenses
- ✅ **Stdio Transport Only**: Communication via standard input/output streams

### Run Security Audit

Enterprise customers can verify these claims:

```bash
# Run full security audit
uv run python -m sef_agents.security_scan

# Output JSON for CI/CD
uv run python -m sef_agents.security_scan --format json
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full security policy and architecture details.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- `uv` or `uvx` ([Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

### Client Compatibility
SEF Agents uses **stdio** transport (Standard Input/Output). It works with:
- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Any MCP-compatible client supporting `stdio`

> **Note**: Gemini and GitHub Copilot do not currently support MCP.

---

## Configuration

**Simple installation** — works like Playwright MCP. No cloning required.

### Cursor (Recommended)

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-local):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sef-agents": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["sef-agents"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Via UI:**
1. Settings → MCP → + Add New MCP Server
2. Name: `sef-agents`
3. Type: `command`
4. Command: `uvx sef-agents`

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sef-agents": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["sef-agents"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sef-agents": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["sef-agents"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Install from GitHub (Development/Unpublished)

If not yet published to PyPI, use GitHub:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sef-agents": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/Mishtert/sef-agents",
        "sef-agents"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Local Development

For contributors or local testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mishtert/sef-agents.git
cd sef-agents
uv sync
uv run sef-agents
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Verify Connection

After adding the config, restart your AI assistant. In Cursor:
- Open Settings → MCP
- Look for `sef-agents` with a green status indicator

### 2. Try These Commands

Type these in your AI assistant to verify it's working:

```
"What SEF agents are available?"
```
**Expected:** List of 13 agents with descriptions.

```
"Set my agent to developer"
```
**Expected:** Elite Code Quality Protocol injected. AI now enforces coding standards.

```
"Generate a codemap for this directory"
```
**Expected:** CODE_MAP.md structure with files, purposes, dependencies.

```
"Scan this directory for technical debt"
```
**Expected:** Report of TODOs, bare exceptions, missing types, long functions.

### 3. Full Workflow Example

```
1. "Set agent to discovery" → Scans codebase, generates documentation
2. "Set agent to product_manager" → Write requirements with testable AC
3. "Set agent to qa_lead" → Validate AC before development
4. "Set agent to developer" → Implement with quality enforcement
5. "Set agent to pr_reviewer" → Review for compliance + AI patterns
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| MCP not connecting | Restart AI assistant after config change |
| `uvx` not found | Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| Tools not appearing | Check MCP status in settings; verify JSON syntax |
| Agent not activating | Use exact agent name: `developer` |
