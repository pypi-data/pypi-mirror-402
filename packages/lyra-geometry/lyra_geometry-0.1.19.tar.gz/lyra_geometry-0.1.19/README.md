# Lyra Geometry

Lyra Geometry is a Python library for symbolic differential geometry with a
focus on tensor spaces, connections, and curvature in Lyra geometry. It is
built on SymPy to support exact tensor manipulation in scripts and notebooks.

## Highlights

- Tensor spaces with index notation (up/down indices).
- Lyra connection and curvature tensors derived from a metric.
- Automatic Einstein summation for repeated labels.
- Covariant derivatives, torsion, and non-metricity support.
- Friendly API designed for interactive exploration.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- SymPy >= 1.12

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install lyra-geometry
```

For local development:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Minimal API reference

Core objects:

- `SpaceTime(coords, metric, connection_strategy=...)`: main high-level API for metrics, connections, and curvature.
  ```python
  st = pl.SpaceTime(coords=(x, y), metric=sp.diag(1, 1))
  st.riemann
  ```
- `TensorSpace(dim, labels=...)`: lower-level tensor space without a metric.
  ```python
  ts = pl.TensorSpace(dim=2, labels=("x", "y"))
  ```
- `Tensor`: tensor container with index-aware arithmetic and contractions.
  ```python
  t = st.tensor.generic("T", (pl.U, pl.D))
  t[+a, -b]
  ```
- `Index`, `UpIndex`, `DownIndex`: index labels and variance markers.
  ```python
  a, b = st.index("a b")
  st.g[-a, -b]
  ```
- `U`, `D`: convenience aliases for up/down index variance.
  ```python
  v = st.tensor.generic("v", (pl.U,))
  w = st.tensor.generic("w", (pl.D,))
  ```

Connection and curvature strategies:

- `LyraConnectionStrategy`, `LyraCurvatureStrategy`: default Lyra geometry behavior.
  ```python
  st = pl.SpaceTime(coords=(x, y), metric=sp.diag(1, 1))
  st.gamma
  ```
- `FixedConnectionStrategy`: use a fixed connection tensor.
  ```python
  Gamma0 = sp.ImmutableDenseNDimArray([0] * 8, (2, 2, 2))
  st = pl.SpaceTime(coords=(x, y), metric=sp.diag(1, 1),
                    connection_strategy=pl.FixedConnectionStrategy(Gamma0))
  ```
- `Connection`, `ConnectionTensor`, `CurvatureStrategy`: building blocks for custom strategies.

Helpers:

- `example_indexing()`: small demo of index notation.
  ```python
  pl.example_indexing()
  ```
- `greek()`: helper for common Greek index labels.
  ```python
  mu, nu = pl.greek("mu nu")
  ```

## Riemann convention

`TensorSpace` and `SpaceTime` accept a `riemann_convention` parameter to control
the overall sign of the curvature tensors. The default is `"mtw"`/`"wald"` and
matches the current library behavior:

```
R^rho_{ sigma mu nu } = d_mu Gamma^rho_{nu sigma}
                      - d_nu Gamma^rho_{mu sigma}
                      + Gamma^rho_{mu lambda} Gamma^lambda_{nu sigma}
                      - Gamma^rho_{nu lambda} Gamma^lambda_{mu sigma}
```

Choosing `"landau-lifshitz"`/`"weinberg"` flips the global sign of the Riemann,
Ricci, and scalar curvature tensors.

```python
st = pl.SpaceTime(coords=(x, y), metric=sp.diag(1, 1), riemann_convention="landau-lifshitz")
```

## Module organization

The public API continues to be re-exported from `lyra_geometry`, but the
implementation is organized by responsibility:

- `lyra_geometry.core`: tensor spaces, connections, curvature strategies.
- `lyra_geometry.tensors`: tensors, indices, and low-level tensor helpers.
- `lyra_geometry.diff_ops`: gradient/divergence/laplacian helpers.
- `lyra_geometry.invariants`: Ricci/Kretschmann/Euler invariants.
- `lyra_geometry.utils`: small utilities like `greek` and `example_indexing`.

## What `lyra-geometry` is (and what it is not)

### What it is

The `lyra-geometry` is a symbolic library to work with relativistic gravity thoeries. Concretely, `lyra-geometry` provides:

- **Exact symbolic tensor calculus** built on top of SymPy.
- A clean, object-oriented **`SpaceTime` abstraction** that organizes:
  - metric, inverse metric, and determinant,
  - Levi–Civita connection (by default),
  - Riemann, Ricci, Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature,
  - covariant derivatives with correct index bookkeeping.
- **Explicit index variance (up/down indices)** with:
  - readable index notation,
  - **automatic Einstein summation** on repeated labels.
- A workflow designed for **interactive notebooks and analytic derivations**,
  where expressions remain transparent and inspectable at every step.

In this default configuration, `lyra-geometry` behaves exactly as a **symbolic
GR toolkit**.

Where the library *extends beyond* standard GR is in its **native support for
Lyra geometry and related non-Riemannian structures**:

- the Lyra scale field $\phi$ can be introduced when desired,
- alternative connection strategies,
- optional torsion and non-metricity sectors.

These features are **opt-in**. They do not interfere with ordinary GR unless
explicitly enabled.

In short:  
**`lyra-geometry` is a symbolic GR library first, and a Lyra-geometry laboratory
second.**

---

### What it is NOT

To set expectations clearly, `lyra-geometry` is **not**:

- A numerical relativity or cosmological simulation framework.
- A high-performance or HPC-oriented tensor engine.
- A “black-box” solver that automatically derives or solves field equations.
- A replacement for large, monolithic CAS environments (e.g. full SageMath).
- A library that enforces Lyra geometry or non-Riemannian assumptions by default.

If you never introduce a scale field, torsion, or non-metricity, the library
remains **purely Riemannian and fully compatible with standard GR practice**.

---

### When it makes sense to use it

`lyra-geometry` is particularly well suited if you want to:

- perform **symbolic GR calculations** with explicit index control,
- derive connections and curvature tensors from a metric in a reproducible way,
- check lengthy analytic derivations while minimizing index errors,
- work entirely in Python notebooks with a clean, inspectable API,
- explore extensions of GR (Lyra geometry, alternative connections) **without
  rewriting your tensor infrastructure**.

If your primary goal is large-scale numerics, data-driven cosmology, or
observational pipelines, this library is best used **in combination with other
tools**, or not at all.

## Getting started

Create a space with a metric, then inspect its basic objects:

```python
import sympy as sp
import lyra_geometry as pl

x, y = sp.symbols("x y", real=True)
metric = sp.diag(x + 2*y, x**2 * y)

st = pl.SpaceTime(coords=(x, y), metric=metric)

st.g          # metric tensor
st.metric_inv # inverse metric matrix
st.detg       # determinant of the metric
```

## Indices, raising/lowering, and components

Use index labels with explicit variance markers to access components:

```python
a, b, c = st.index("a b c")

st.g[-a, -b]  # g_ab
st.g[+a, +b]  # g^ab

st.g[-a, -b](0, 0)  # component access
```

Bare indices (like `t[a, b]`) are not accepted; always use `+a`/`-a`.

## Generic tensors and contraction

Create symbolic tensors and let repeated labels contract automatically:

```python
v = st.tensor.generic("v", (pl.U,))
w = st.tensor.generic("w", (pl.D,))

scalar = v[+a] * w[-a]  # automatic contraction
```

Explicit contraction and a simple index-string parser are also available:

```python
st.contract(v[+a], w[-a])
st.eval_contract("v^a w_a")
```

## Covariant derivative

The Lyra covariant derivative adds one covariant index:

```python
dv = st.nabla(v)
dv.signature  # (D, U)
dv[-b, +a](0, 0)
```

## Connection and curvature

When a metric is provided, the Lyra connection and curvature tensors are
computed automatically:

```python
st.gamma            # Gamma^a_{bc}
st.riemann          # Riemann tensor
st.ricci            # Ricci tensor
st.einstein         # Einstein tensor
st.scalar_curvature # scalar curvature
```

## Scale, torsion, and non-metricity

You can set a scale field and provide torsion/non-metricity explicitly:

```python
phi = sp.Function("phi")(x)
st.set_scale(phi)

st.set_torsion(st.zeros((pl.D, pl.D, pl.D)))
st.set_nonmetricity(st.zeros((pl.U, pl.D, pl.D)))

st.update()
```

## Custom connection strategies

If you already have Gamma components, you can fix the connection manually:

```python
Gamma0 = sp.ImmutableDenseNDimArray([0] * (2**3), (2, 2, 2))

st2 = pl.SpaceTime(
    coords=(x, y),
    metric=sp.diag(1, 1),
    connection_strategy=pl.FixedConnectionStrategy(Gamma0),
)

st2.gamma
```

## Simplification with fmt

Use `fmt()` to expand and simplify expressions:

```python
st.ricci.fmt()
st.einstein.fmt()
st.scalar_curvature.fmt()
```

## Notebook examples

The notebook `examples/example.ipynb` walks through:

- A quick tutorial of the core API.
- Schwarzschild spacetime: metric, connection, and curvature tensors.
- FLRW spacetime: metric, curvature, and covariant derivative of a scalar.
- A spherically symmetric LyST solution with scale field and field equations.

## Project structure

- `src/lyra_geometry/core.py`: core implementation.
- `src/lyra_geometry/__init__.py`: public exports and version.
- `examples/example.ipynb`: tutorial and physics examples.
- `tests/`: pytest smoke tests.

## Development and testing

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Versioning and release policy

This project follows SemVer 2.0 with a pre-1.0 policy:

- While major is 0, breaking changes bump the minor version.
- Backward-compatible changes (features, improvements) also bump the minor.
- Fixes that do not change behavior bump the patch.

The public API is the set of objects exported from `src/lyra_geometry/__init__.py`
and the behaviors documented in this README. Other internal modules may change
without notice.

Release checklist (short form):

1. Move items from `Unreleased` into a new version section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Bump the version in `src/lyra_geometry/__init__.py`.
3. Run `python -m pytest` and record the outcome in the release notes.
4. Tag and publish the release.
