# Roseau Load Flow

![CI](https://github.com/RoseauTechnologies/Roseau_Load_Flow/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
![pre-commit](https://github.com/RoseauTechnologies/Roseau_Load_Flow/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml/badge.svg)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/roseau-load-flow/badge/?version=latest)](https://roseau-load-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

<!-- start rlf-pitch -->

_Roseau Load Flow_ is a powerful load flow solver and static analysis tool that offers:

- **Multi-phase**, **unbalanced** power flow analysis
- A performance optimized solver written in C++
- A catalogue of real-world transformer and line models
- An ergonomic object-oriented Python interface with unit-aware quantities
- A comprehensive documentation with code examples
- Real-world distribution network data samples in the library (with more available on request)

In addition to the following **unique** set of features:

- Support for _floating neutrals_ for loads and sources
- Four-wire multi-phase modelling with no Kron's reduction, no transformations, no assumptions on the network topology
  and no implicit earthing everywhere
- Support for **flexible**, voltage-dependent, loads directly in the Newton algorithm for better convergence and
  stability

<!-- end rlf-pitch -->

This project is compatible with Python version 3.12 and newer. The
[installation instructions](https://roseau-load-flow.roseautechnologies.com/en/latest/Installation.html) will guide you
through the installation process. If you are new to _Roseau Load Flow_, we recommend you start with the
[getting started tutorial](https://roseau-load-flow.roseautechnologies.com/en/latest/usage/Getting_Started.html). You
can find the complete documentation at https://roseau-load-flow.roseautechnologies.com/.

## License

This project is _partially_ open source but using the solver requires a license. The license key
`A8C6DA-9405FB-E74FB9-C71C3C-207661-V3` can be used free of charge with networks containing up to 10 buses. To obtain a

## Network data

<!-- start rlf-networks -->

_Roseau Load Flow_ ships with a sample of 20 low-voltage and 20 medium-voltage feeder networks. Each network is provided
with its summer and winter load points.

<!-- start representative-networks -->

We also maintain a set of 150 MV feeders representative of the French distribution system at
https://github.com/RoseauTechnologies/Representative_French_Power_Grids. Each feeder is modeled with its downstream LV
networks. The repository also contains the cluster size that indicates how representative is each network of the French
distribution system. These networks are the result of the study
[Representative MV feeders for the analysis of French distribution networks](https://www.roseautechnologies.com/en/electrical-model-of-the-french-distribution-network/),
made and published by [Mines Paris Tech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/).
