# CI/CD Hub Scaffold - Python with src/ layout
# Generated by: cihub scaffold --type python-src-layout
#
# This project uses the src/ layout pattern where source code lives in src/package_name/.
# This layout is recommended for published packages as it prevents accidental imports
# of the local package during development.
#
# Available tools (enable in .ci-hub.yml):
#   Testing:    pytest, hypothesis, mutmut
#   Linting:    ruff, black, isort, mypy
#   Security:   bandit, pip_audit, semgrep, trivy, codeql
#   Artifacts:  sbom, docker
#
# Next steps:
# 1. Run: cihub init --language python
# 2. Run: cihub smoke --full
# 3. Customize tools in .ci-hub.yml
