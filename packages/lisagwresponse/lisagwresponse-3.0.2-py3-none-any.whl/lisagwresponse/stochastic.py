class StochasticBackground(Response):
    """Represent a whole-sky gravitational-wave stochastic background.

    The sky is pixelized using healpix, and each pixel is considered as a
    stochastic point source, whose power is the product of the background
    spectrum and the pixel amplitude on the sky map.

    The response of each link is the superposition of the responses to each of
    the pixels (i.e., the stochastic point sources) making up the sky. Note that
    using a greater number of pixels increases the precision of the response but
    also the computational cost.

    .. admonition:: Memory usage

        Stochastic point sources are created for each pixel when an instance of
        :class:`StochasticBackground` is initialized, which triggers the
        generation of the random strain time series for the entire sky.

        For long simulations, this might not be tractable in terms of memory
        usage. In this case, we recommend that you use ``optim=True`` to keep
        the memory usage to a minimum; when enabled, point sources are not
        created at initialization time, but when they are needed in
        :meth:`compute_gw_response`, then immediately destroyed.

        Note that in this case, you will be limited to a single call to
        :meth:`compute_gw_response`. Subsequent calls will generate new point
        sources, leading to different an inconsistent sky.

    Args:
        skymap: Amplitude sky map (created from Healpix) in ICRS, of shape
            ``(npix,)``.
        generator: Stochastic generator shared by all pixels, for the strain
            time series (see :class:`lisagwresponse.psd.Generator`).
        t0: Initial TCB time for the strain time series [s], as the number of
            seconds elapsed since the LISA epoch.
        dt: Sampling period for the strain time series [s].
        size: Simulation size for the strain time series [samples].
        margin: Left and right time interpolation margin for strain time series
            [s]. Default is 1.2 au / c, to account for the maximum phase between
            the Sun and the constellation barycenter, with a 20% margin.
        optim: Enable memory usage optimization. If enabled, stochastic point
            sources are only created when needed, and immediately destroyed.
            This will limit you to a single call to :meth:`compute_gw_response`.
