              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
              Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Moomoo API MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the Moomoo trading platform. This server allows AI agents (like Claude Desktop or Gemini) to access market data, account information, and execute trades via the moomoo-api Python SDK.

## Features

- **Market Data**: Real-time quotes, historical K-lines, market snapshots, and order books.
- **Account Management**: Comprehensive account summaries, assets, positions, and cash flow analysis.
- **Trading**: Full order management including placing, modifying, and canceling orders.
- **System Health**: Built-in health checks and connectivity verification.

- `get_history_deals`: Search historical deals.

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

You can run the server directly using `uvx` (part of the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) toolkit).
Using `--refresh` ensures you are always running the latest version:

```bash
uvx --refresh moomoo-api-mcp
```

### Permanent Installation

To install it as a persistent tool available in your shell:

```bash
uv tool install moomoo-api-mcp
# Then run:
moomoo-api-mcp
```

> **Note**: The `moomoo-api` Python SDK and other dependencies will be installed automatically.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Litash/moomoo-api-mcp.git
   cd moomoo-api-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   uv run moomoo-api-mcp
   ```

---

## Configuration

### 1. Prerequisites

#### Moomoo OpenD (Required)

The MCP server communicates with the Moomoo API via **Moomoo OpenD**, a local gateway application. You **MUST** install and run this first.

1. **Download OpenD**:
   - Visit the [Moomoo Open API Download Page](https://www.moomoo.com/download/opend).
   - Download the version appropriate for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

2. **Install & Run**:
   - Install the application.
   - Launch **Moomoo OpenD**.
   - Log in with your Moomoo account credentials.

3. **Configure**:
   - Ensure the listening port is set to `11111` (this is the default).
   - **Note**: The MCP server connects to `127.0.0.1:11111` by default.

### 2. Environment Variables

To enable **REAL account** access, you must securely provide your credentials.

| Variable                | Description                                | Example  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD` | Your trading password (plain text)         | `123456` |
| `MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM`  | Your broker region (e.g., FUTUSG, FUTUINC) | `FUTUSG` |

> **Note**: Without these, the server runs in **SIMULATE-only mode** (paper trading).

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Option A: Using PyPI Package (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moomoo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--refresh", "moomoo-api-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD": "your_trading_password",
        "MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM": "FUTUSG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The `--refresh` flag ensures you always have the latest version but may increase startup time due to version checking. You can remove it once you have the correct version installed.

#### Option B: Local Development

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moomoo": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\path\\to\\moomoo-api-mcp",
        "run",
        "moomoo-api-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD": "your_trading_password",
        "MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM": "FUTUSG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security**: Never commit your password to version control. The `env` block in the config file remains local.

## AI Agent Guidance

> **IMPORTANT**: All account tools default to **REAL** trading accounts.

When using this MCP server, AI agents **MUST**:

1. **Notify the user clearly** before accessing REAL account data. Example:

   > "I'm about to access your **REAL trading account**. This will show your actual portfolio and balances."

2. **Follow the unlock workflow** for REAL accounts:
   - First call `unlock_trade` (it handles env vars automatically, or pass password if needed).
   - Then call account/trading tools (they default to `trd_env='REAL'`).

3. **Only use SIMULATE accounts when explicitly requested** by the user. To use simulation:
   - Pass `trd_env='SIMULATE'` parameter explicitly.
   - No unlock is required for simulation accounts.

### Workflow Example

```text
User: "Show me my portfolio"

Agent Response:
"I'm accessing your REAL trading account to show your portfolio.
If you prefer to use a simulation account instead, please let me know."

[Proceeds to unlock_trade → get_account_summary]
```
