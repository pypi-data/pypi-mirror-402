## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker/wiki/Using-Netbox-Plugins).

### Prerequisites

- **NetBox 4.5.0 or higher** (for plugin version 2.0.0)
  - **Important**: Plugin version 2.0.0 is NOT compatible with NetBox 4.4.x due to filter system changes
  - If you're running NetBox 4.4.x, use plugin version 1.2.8 or earlier

### Installation

You can install with pip:

```bash
pip install netbox-cesnet-services-plugin
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt` (netbox-docker):

```bash
# For NetBox 4.5.0+
netbox-cesnet-services-plugin==2.0.0

# For NetBox 4.4.x (use 1.2.8 or earlier)
# netbox-cesnet-services-plugin==1.2.8
```

### Configuration

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file.

You can optionally set device platforms for filtering choices in LLDPNeighbor form: 

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'netbox_cesnet_services_plugin'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_cesnet_services_plugin": {
        "platforms" : ["ios", "iosxe", "iosxr", "nxos", "nxos_ssh"],
    },
}
```
