`num2words2` is a modern, actively maintained fork of the original `num2words` library, optimized for LLM/AI/speech applications. It converts numbers like `42` to words like `forty-two` across 50+ languages. This fork was created because the original Savoir-faire Linux repository was no longer being maintained at the pace required for the rapidly evolving AI, machine learning, and speech synthesis ecosystem.

## Why num2words2?

The original `num2words` library by Savoir-faire Linux became unmaintained and couldn't keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the AI/LLM/speech technology space. Modern applications like:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** requiring robust text preprocessing
- **Speech synthesis systems** needing accurate number-to-word conversion
- **Voice assistants and chatbots** processing numerical data
- **AI training pipelines** requiring consistent text normalization
- **Multilingual AI applications** spanning 50+ languages

...needed a more actively maintained solution with faster bug fixes, enhanced language support, and compatibility with modern Python ecosystems.

## Features

- Convert numbers to words in 50+ languages
- Support for cardinal, ordinal, currency, and year conversion
- Enhanced language support including recent additions (Armenian, Mongolian, Shona)
- Critical bug fixes for decimal handling, negative numbers, and float conversions
- Optimized for modern AI/ML/speech applications
- Actively maintained with regular updates and community contributions
- Drop-in replacement for the original num2words
- Modern CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing

## Installation

```bash
pip install num2words2
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from num2words2 import num2words

# Cardinal numbers
print(num2words(42))  # forty-two
print(num2words(42, lang='es'))  # cuarenta y dos
print(num2words(42, lang='fr'))  # quarante-deux

# Ordinal numbers
print(num2words(42, to='ordinal'))  # forty-second
print(num2words(42, to='ordinal', lang='es'))  # cuadragésimo segundo

# Currency
print(num2words(42.50, to='currency'))  # forty-two euro, fifty cents
print(num2words(42.50, to='currency', lang='es'))  # cuarenta y dos euros con cincuenta céntimos

# Year
print(num2words(2024, to='year'))  # two thousand and twenty-four
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
$ num2words2 10001
ten thousand and one

$ num2words2 24120.10
twenty-four thousand, one hundred and twenty point one

$ num2words2 24120.10 -l es
veinticuatro mil ciento veinte punto uno

$ num2words2 2.14 -l es --to currency
dos euros con catorce céntimos

## Migration from num2words

`num2words2` is designed as a drop-in replacement for `num2words` with full backward compatibility.

### 🤖 Automated Migration (Recommended)

We provide a migration script to automatically update your codebase:

```bash
# Download and run the migration script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqueguiner/num2words/master/migrate_to_num2words2.py
python migrate_to_num2words2.py /path/to/your/project

# Or just scan current directory
python migrate_to_num2words2.py .

# Dry run to see what would change (recommended first step)
python migrate_to_num2words2.py --dry-run .
```

The script will:
- 🔍 Find all Python files with `num2words` imports
- 💾 Create backups of original files
- 🔄 Update imports to use `num2words2`
- 📝 Provide a detailed summary of changes

### 📝 Manual Migration

If you prefer manual migration, simply update your imports:

```python
# Before
from num2words import num2words

# After
from num2words2 import num2words
```

For backward compatibility during transition:

```python
try:
    from num2words2 import num2words
except ImportError:
    from num2words import num2words
```

### 📦 Update Dependencies

Update your dependency files:

```bash
# requirements.txt
- num2words>=0.5.12
+ num2words2>=0.5.15

# pyproject.toml
dependencies = [
-    "num2words>=0.5.12",
+    "num2words2>=0.5.15",
]

# setup.py
install_requires=[
-    "num2words>=0.5.12",
+    "num2words2>=0.5.15",
],
```

### 🧪 Testing Your Migration

After migration, test your application:

```python
# Test basic functionality
from num2words2 import num2words

# These should work exactly as before
assert num2words(42) == "forty-two"
assert num2words(42, lang='es') == "cuarenta y dos"
assert num2words(42, to='ordinal') == "forty-second"
```

### 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Install num2words2
pip install num2words2

# If you were using num2words, you can remove it
pip uninstall num2words
```

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

`num2words2` maintains full backward compatibility. However, if you experience any issues:

1. **Check version compatibility** - Ensure you're using `num2words2>=0.5.15`
2. **Report issues** - Create an issue at https://github.com/jqueguiner/num2words/issues
3. **Rollback if needed** - The migration script creates backups for easy rollback

### 🔄 Rollback Migration

If you need to rollback:

```bash
# The migration script creates .num2words_backup files
# Restore them if needed
for file in $(find . -name "*.num2words_backup"); do
    original="${file%.num2words_backup}"
    cp "$file" "$original"
    echo "Restored $original"
done
```
