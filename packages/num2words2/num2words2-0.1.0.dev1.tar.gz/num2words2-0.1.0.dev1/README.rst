``num2words2`` is a modern, actively maintained fork of the original num2words library
that converts numbers like ``42`` to words like ``forty-two``. It supports multiple
languages (see the list below for full list of languages) and can even generate
ordinal numbers like ``forty-second``. This fork was created to address the maintenance
gap in the original project and optimize for modern AI/LLM/speech applications.

The project is hosted on GitHub_. Contributions are welcome.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install ``num2words2`` is to use pip::

    pip install num2words2

Otherwise, you can download the source package and then execute::

    python setup.py install

The test suite in this library is new, so it's rather thin, but it can be run with::

    python setup.py test

To run the full CI test suite which includes linting and multiple python environments::

    pip install tox
    tox

Development Setup
-----------------
The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To set up your development environment::

    # Install pre-commit
    pip install pre-commit

    # Install the git hook scripts
    pre-commit install

    # Run hooks on all files (optional, useful for initial setup)
    pre-commit run --all-files

This will automatically format and lint your code before each commit using:

* autopep8 - PEP 8 formatting
* autoflake - removes unused imports and variables
* isort - sorts imports
* flake8 - style and quality checks
* trailing-whitespace removal
* end-of-file fixing

Usage
-----
Command line::

    $ num2words2 10001
    ten thousand and one
    $ num2words2 24,120.10
    twenty-four thousand, one hundred and twenty point one
    $ num2words2 24,120.10 -l es
    veinticuatro mil ciento veinte punto uno
    $ num2words2 2.14 -l es --to currency
    dos euros con catorce céntimos

In code there's only one function to use::

    >>> from num2words2 import num2words
    >>> num2words(42)
    forty-two
    >>> num2words(42, to='ordinal')
    forty-second
    >>> num2words(42, lang='fr')
    quarante-deux

Besides the numerical argument, there are two main optional arguments, ``to:`` and ``lang:``

**to:** The converter to use. Supported values are:

* ``cardinal`` (default)
* ``ordinal``
* ``ordinal_num``
* ``year``
* ``currency``

**lang:** The language in which to convert the number. Supported values are:

* ``en`` (English, default)
* ``am`` (Amharic)
* ``ar`` (Arabic)
* ``az`` (Azerbaijani)
* ``be`` (Belarusian)
* ``bn`` (Bangladeshi)
* ``ca`` (Catalan)
* ``ce`` (Chechen)
* ``cs`` (Czech)
* ``cy`` (Welsh)
* ``da`` (Danish)
* ``de`` (German)
* ``en_GB`` (English - Great Britain)
* ``en_IN`` (English - India)
* ``en_NG`` (English - Nigeria)
* ``es`` (Spanish)
* ``es_CO`` (Spanish - Colombia)
* ``es_CR`` (Spanish - Costa Rica)
* ``es_GT`` (Spanish - Guatemala)
* ``es_VE`` (Spanish - Venezuela)
* ``eu`` (EURO)
* ``fa`` (Farsi)
* ``fi`` (Finnish)
* ``fr`` (French)
* ``fr_BE`` (French - Belgium)
* ``fr_CH`` (French - Switzerland)
* ``fr_DZ`` (French - Algeria)
* ``he`` (Hebrew)
* ``hi`` (Hindi)
* ``hu`` (Hungarian)
* ``hy`` (Armenian)
* ``id`` (Indonesian)
* ``is`` (Icelandic)
* ``it`` (Italian)
* ``ja`` (Japanese)
* ``kn`` (Kannada)
* ``ko`` (Korean)
* ``kz`` (Kazakh)
* ``mn`` (Mongolian)
* ``lt`` (Lithuanian)
* ``lv`` (Latvian)
* ``nl`` (Dutch)
* ``no`` (Norwegian)
* ``pl`` (Polish)
* ``pt`` (Portuguese)
* ``pt_BR`` (Portuguese - Brazilian)
* ``ro`` (Romanian)
* ``ru`` (Russian)
* ``sl`` (Slovene)
* ``sk`` (Slovak)
* ``sr`` (Serbian)
* ``sv`` (Swedish)
* ``te`` (Telugu)
* ``tet`` (Tetum)
* ``tg`` (Tajik)
* ``tr`` (Turkish)
* ``th`` (Thai)
* ``uk`` (Ukrainian)
* ``vi`` (Vietnamese)
* ``zh`` (Chinese - Traditional)
* ``zh_CN`` (Chinese - Simplified / Mainland China)
* ``zh_TW`` (Chinese - Traditional / Taiwan)
* ``zh_HK`` (Chinese - Traditional / Hong Kong)

You can supply values like ``fr_FR``; if the country doesn't exist but the
language does, the code will fall back to the base language (i.e. ``fr``). If
you supply an unsupported language, ``NotImplementedError`` is raised.
Therefore, if you want to call ``num2words`` with a fallback, you can do::

    try:
        return num2words(42, lang=mylang)
    except NotImplementedError:
        return num2words(42, lang='en')

Additionally, some converters and languages support other optional arguments
that are needed to make the converter useful in practice.

History
-------

``num2words`` is based on an old library, ``pynum2word``, created by Taro Ogawa
in 2003. Unfortunately, the library stopped being maintained and the author
can't be reached. There was another developer, Marius Grigaitis, who in 2011
added Lithuanian support, but didn't take over maintenance of the project.

Virgil Dupras from Savoir-faire Linux based himself on Marius Grigaitis' improvements
and re-published ``pynum2word`` as ``num2words``.

``num2words2`` Fork
-------------------

``num2words2`` is a modern fork of the original ``num2words`` library, created to address
the maintenance gap and optimize for modern AI/LLM/speech applications. This fork:

* Provides active maintenance aligned with rapidly evolving AI/ML ecosystem
* Fixes critical bugs affecting machine learning pipelines
* Adds enhanced language support for global AI applications
* Maintains backward compatibility with the original library
