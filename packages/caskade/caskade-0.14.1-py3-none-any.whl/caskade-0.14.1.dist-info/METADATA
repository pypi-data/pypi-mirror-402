Build scientific simulators, treating them as a directed acyclic graph. Handles
argument passing for complex nested simulators.

## Install

``` bash
pip install caskade
```

More details on the [docs page](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). 
if you want to use `caskade` with `jax` then run:

```bash
pip install caskade[jax]
```

Alternately, just pip install `jax`/`jaxlib` separately as they are the only extra requirements.

## Usage

Make a `Module` object which may have some `Param`s. Define a `forward` method
using the decorator.

``` python
from caskade import Module, Param, forward

class MySim(Module):
    def __init__(self, a, b=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.a = a
        self.b = Param("b", b)

    @forward
    def myfun(self, x, b=None):
        return x + self.a + b
```

We may now create instances of the simulator and pass the dynamic parameters.

``` python
import torch

sim = MySim(1.0)

params = [torch.tensor(2.0)]

print(sim.myfun(3.0, params=params))
```

Which will print `6` by automatically filling `b` with the value from `params`.

### Why do this?

The above example is not very impressive, the real power comes from the fact
that `Module` objects can be nested, making an arbitrarily complicated
analysis graph. Some other features include:

* Unroll parameters into 1D vector to interface with other packages (emcee, scipy.optimize, dynesty, etc.)
* Link parameters by value or functional relationship
* Reparametrize (e.g. between polar and cartesian) without modifying underlying code
* Save and load sampling chains automatically in HDF5
* Track metadata alongside parameters
* And much more! [Beginner tutorial](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/BeginnersGuide.html) and [Advanced tutorial](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/AdvancedGuide.html)

### Use different backends

`caskade` can be run with different backends for `torch`, `numpy`, and `jax`.
See the [Beginners Guide
tutorial](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/BeginnersGuide.html)
to learn more!

## Documentation

The `caskade` interface has lots of flexibility, check out the
[docs](https://caskade.readthedocs.io) to learn more. For a quick start, jump
right to the [Jupyter notebook
tutorial](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/BeginnersGuide.html)!

The [`caustics`](https://github.com/Ciela-Institute/caustics) package can serve
as a project template utilizing the many features of `caskade`.

The `caskade` package maintains 100% coverage for unit testing, ensuring
reliability as the backbone of a research project.
