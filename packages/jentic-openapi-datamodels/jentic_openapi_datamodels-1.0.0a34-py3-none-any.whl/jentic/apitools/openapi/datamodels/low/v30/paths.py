class Paths:
    """
    Paths Object representation for OpenAPI 3.0.

    Holds the relative paths to the individual endpoints and their operations.
    The paths are appended to the server URL to construct the full URL.

    Path field names MUST begin with a forward slash (/). Path templating is supported
    (e.g., /users/{id}). When matching URLs, concrete (non-templated) paths are matched
    before templated paths. Templated paths with the same hierarchy but different templated
    names are not allowed.

    Attributes:
        root_node: The top-level node representing the entire Paths object in the original source file
        paths: Map of path strings to Path Item Objects. Each key is a relative path that MUST begin
               with a forward slash (/). Supports path templating with curly braces.
        extensions: Specification extensions (x-* fields)

    """
    Build a Paths object from a YAML node.

    Preserves all source data as-is, regardless of type. This is a low-level/plumbing
    model that provides complete source fidelity for inspection and validation.

    Args:
        root: The YAML node to parse (should be a MappingNode)
        context: Optional parsing context. If None, a default context will be created.

    Returns:
        A Paths object if the node is valid, or a ValueSource containing
        the invalid data if the root is not a MappingNode (preserving the invalid data
        and its source location for validation).

    Example:
        from ruamel.yaml import YAML
        yaml = YAML()
        root = yaml.compose('''
        /users:
          get:

            responses:
              '200':
