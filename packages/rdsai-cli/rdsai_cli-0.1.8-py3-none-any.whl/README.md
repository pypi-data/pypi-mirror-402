RDSAI CLI is a next-generation, AI-powered RDS CLI that transforms how you interact with the database. You describe your intent in natural language or SQL, and the AI agent performs hybrid processing of both: orchestrating diagnostic tools, analyzing execution plans, and executing queries — all without leaving your terminal. From performance troubleshooting to schema exploration, it handles the complexity so you can focus on what truly matters.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Source Connection** — Connect to MySQL databases, local files (CSV, Excel), and remote data sources (HTTP/HTTPS URLs), with support for multiple files simultaneously
- **AI Assistant** — Natural language queries (English/中文), optimized SQL, diagnostics, and explanations
- **Smart SQL** — Auto-detects SQL vs natural language, query history, `Ctrl+E` for instant result explanations
- **Multi-Model LLM** — Support for Qwen, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Schema Analysis** — AI-powered database analysis with compliance checking and optimization suggestions
- **Performance Benchmarking** — Automated sysbench testing with comprehensive analysis reports
- **MCP Integration** — Extend capabilities via Model Context Protocol servers
- **Safety First** — Read-only by default, DDL/DML requires confirmation (YOLO mode available)

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

- Python **3.13+**
- Network access to your RDS instance (currently only MySQL is supported)
- API access to at least one LLM provider (Qwen / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI-compatible)
- **sysbench** (optional, for `/benchmark` command) — Install from [sysbench GitHub](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench)

### One-Click Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install rdsai-cli is using our automated installation script:

```bash
# Using curl (recommended)
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyun/rdsai-cli/main/install.sh | sh

# Or using wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyun/rdsai-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Install from PyPI

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the Python package manager for faster installation and better dependency resolution.
For more installation options, see [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
# Using uv (recommended - provides isolated environment)
uv tool install --python 3.13 rdsai-cli

# Or using pip (may cause dependency conflicts with other packages)
# Recommended: Use virtual environment: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install rdsai-cli
```

After installation, the `rdsai` command will be available globally. **Note:** Using `pip install` may cause dependency conflicts with other Python packages. We recommend using `uv tool install` or installing in a virtual environment.

### Install from source (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliyun/rdsai-cli.git
cd rdsai-cli

# Using uv
uv sync
uv sync --extra dev  # with dev dependencies

# Or using pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For development installations, use `uv run rdsai` or activate the virtual environment first.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Launch the CLI

```bash
# Start without connection (interactive mode)
rdsai

# Connect via command line arguments
rdsai --host localhost -u root -p secret -D mydb

# With SSL
rdsai --host db.example.com -u admin -p secret \
  --ssl-mode REQUIRED --ssl-ca /path/to/ca.pem

# Custom port
rdsai --host localhost -P 3307 -u root -p secret
```

You can start the CLI **without any connection parameters** and connect later using the interactive `/connect` command:

**Connect to MySQL database:**
```text
$ rdsai
> /connect
# Interactive form will prompt for Host, Port, Username, Password, Database
```

**Connect to files or data sources:**
```text
# Connect to a CSV file in current directory
> /connect flights.csv

# Connect to a local file
> /connect /path/to/data.csv
> /connect ./data.xlsx

# Connect to a remote file via HTTP/HTTPS
> /connect https://example.com/data.csv

# Connect to multiple files
> /connect file1.csv file2.csv
```

**Supported file formats:**
- CSV files (`.csv`)
- Excel files (`.xlsx`, Excel 2007+ format)

**Connection options:**

| Option       | Short | Description                         | Default |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--host`     | `-h`  | Database host                       |         |
| `--user`     | `-u`  | Username                            |         |
| `--password` | `-p`  | Password                            |         |
| `--port`     | `-P`  | Port                                | `3306`  |
| `--database` | `-D`  | Default database                    |         |
| `--yolo`     | `-y`  | Auto-approve all actions            | off     |
| `--ssl-mode` |       | SSL mode                            |         |
| `--ssl-ca`   |       | CA certificate path                 |         |
| `--ssl-cert` |       | Client certificate path             |         |
| `--ssl-key`  |       | Client key path                     |         |

SSL modes: `DISABLED`, `PREFERRED`, `REQUIRED`, `VERIFY_CA`, `VERIFY_IDENTITY`

### 2. Configure LLM

Use the interactive wizard to configure your LLM provider:

```text
mysql> /setup
```

The wizard will walk you through:

1. **Select Platform** — Qwen, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Gemini, or a generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint
2. **Configure API** — Base URL (if needed), API Key, Model Name
3. **Save & Apply** — Configuration is persisted and the shell is reloaded automatically

**Configuration file:**
- Path: `~/.rdsai-cli/config.json`
- Contains: providers, models, language, default model settings

You can edit this JSON manually for advanced setups.

## 📖 Basic Usage

### SQL Execution

Plain SQL is executed directly against MySQL, with results formatted via Rich:

```text
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE orders;
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
mysql> SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10\G   -- vertical format
```

**Quick Explain with Ctrl+E**: After executing any SQL query, press `Ctrl+E` to get an AI-powered explanation of the result or error. This helps you understand:
- What the query result means
- Why a query might be slow or return unexpected results
- The cause of SQL errors and how to fix them

The explain hint (`💡 Ctrl+E: Explain result` or `💡 Ctrl+E: Explain error`) is automatically shown after each query execution.

### Natural Language

Just type what you need; the agent will call tools, run DDL SQL (with confirmation), and explain results:

```text
mysql> analyze index usage on users table
mysql> show me slow queries from the last hour
mysql> check for lock waits
mysql> design an orders table for e-commerce
mysql> why this query is slow: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%john%'
mysql> find tables without primary keys
mysql> show me the replication status
```

The shell automatically:
- Detects whether input is **SQL** or **natural language**
- Records query execution history
- Injects the last query result into the AI context when helpful

### Meta Commands

Meta commands start with `/` and never hit MySQL directly.

## ⚡ YOLO Mode

YOLO mode skips confirmation prompts for potentially destructive actions (DDL/DML).

```bash
# Enable at startup
rdsai --host localhost -u root -p secret --yolo
```

```text
# Toggle at runtime
mysql> /yolo on
mysql> /yolo off
```

Use this **only** in non-production or when you fully trust the actions being taken.

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Read-Only by Default** — The AI runs in a conservative mode; DDL/DML require explicit confirmation unless YOLO is on.
2. **Confirmation Required** — Every write operation surfaces the exact SQL for review before execution.
3. **Credential Storage** — API keys and model settings are stored in `~/.rdsai-cli/config.json`; protect that file with proper OS permissions.
4. **Transaction Safety** — The shell warns you about uncommitted transactions when you attempt to exit.
