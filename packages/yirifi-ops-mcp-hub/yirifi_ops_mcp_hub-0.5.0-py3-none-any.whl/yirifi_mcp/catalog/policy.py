"""Policy validation for MCP catalogs.

This module provides security policy definitions and validation to prevent
accidental exposure of dangerous operations as DIRECT MCP tools.

Example usage:
    from yirifi_mcp.catalog.policy import CatalogPolicy, validate_catalog

    policy = CatalogPolicy(
        mandatory_gateway=["/rbac/roles/*", "*/password*"],
        mandatory_exclude=["/health/*", "/internal/*"],
    )

    violations = validate_catalog(catalog, policy)
    if violations:
        for v in violations:
            print(f"VIOLATION: {v}")
        raise PolicyViolationError(violations)
