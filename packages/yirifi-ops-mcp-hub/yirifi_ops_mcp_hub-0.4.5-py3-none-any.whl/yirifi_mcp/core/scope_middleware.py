"""MCP Protocol Scope Handling for URL-based tool filtering.

MCPScopeWrapper: ASGI wrapper that normalizes paths and sets scope in ContextVar.
Tool filtering is handled by ScopeFilterMiddleware at the FastMCP protocol layer.

URL path patterns:
- /mcp/message → all tools
- /mcp/auth/message → only auth service tools
- /mcp/reg/message → only reg service tools
- /mcp/auth,reg/message → auth + reg tools (composable)
