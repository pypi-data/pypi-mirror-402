Rooted patterns in a user’s global gitignore (the file set by git’s core.excludesfile) are not honored when global ignores are enabled. For example, if the global ignore file contains "/.venv", enabling global ignores (e.g., WalkBuilder.git_global(true)) still yields the repository’s top-level .venv directory instead of excluding it. Reproduce by setting core.excludesfile to a file containing "/.venv", enabling global ignore handling, and walking a repo with a top-level .venv; the .venv entry is unexpectedly present. Expected behavior: a rooted pattern in the global ignore file should be treated as anchored to the repository root and exclude matching top-level paths.
