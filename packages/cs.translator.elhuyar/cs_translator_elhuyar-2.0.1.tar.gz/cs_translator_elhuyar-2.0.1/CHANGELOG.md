# 2.0 (2026-01-16)

## Breaking changes:


- Replace ``pkg_resources`` namespace with PEP 420 native namespace.
  Support only Plone 6.2 and Python 3.10+. (#3928)


## Internal:


- Go back to use setup.py, because we have many projects in the cs namespace that can't be migrated @erral
- Update configuration files.
