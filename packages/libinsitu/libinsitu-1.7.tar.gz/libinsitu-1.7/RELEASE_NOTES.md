1.7 :
* Ligrate to modern numpy / netCDF / Python so that local build of wheels are not required 

1.6.2 :
* Added support for *.tsv files. Default to TSV for unknown extensions
* ins-cat : By default output values of flags
* Fixed Python Handler for SOLRAD 
* Fixed E2E test
* Relaxed dependencies (with ~=) for better support of Python3.9 to Python 3.11 : 
  Python3.12 not supported yet due to usage of Pandas 1.X

1.6.1:
* Fix dependencies, preventing numpy2

1.6:
* Improved generic encoding (yaml config file, extra options)
* Scalar variables (such as latitude,longitude,elevation) 
  are now explicitely filled from metadata with the custom '_value' attribute in CDL file.
  This enables to define custom CDL with varying lat,lon from CSV files.
* Updated QC flags. 
  They are now controlled by an embedded declarative file (res/qc-tests.csv) 

1.5: 
* Added generic encoding from Excel and CSV in CLI commands

1.4 :
* Added function dataframe_to_netcdf() to encode NetCDF from an existing dataframe
* Updated the Convention to include QC flags in it
* Added filter on QC in netcdf_to_dataframe() and cat.py CLI command

1.3.2 :
* Fixed IEA_PVPS after updates of convention : Time -> time
* Added end to end tests for BSRN data
* Added end to end tests for QC
* Added virtualenv to tests, to ensure proper requirements.txt

1.3.1 :
* Removed support for plotly for now : dependencies were broken
* Embed current version in __version__ automatically
* Update Qc within "transform" flow
* Fixed missing requirements 

1.3 :
* Fixed bug splitting meta data with "," to lists
* Added CLI utils ins-update-meta, to only update metadata for NetCDF files without recomputing data
* Fixed CDL to be better compliant with cf conventions
* Extracted visual QC in a proper Python function

1.2 :
* Fixed bug in date filtering of nc2df with start date different from origin date
* Migrated to new conventions
* Added QC flags and ins-qc (cli) to generate visual QC images and add flags in NetCDF files
* Added handler for IEA_PVPS, ESMAP, SKYNET, ISE_PVLIVE
* Added CLI ins-info to dump CSV meta data
* Added stats and header to cat.py (formely dump.py)

1.1 :
* Separate start date from date-origin
* Set date origin to a fixed value : 1970-01-01 UTC

1.0 :
* First release on PyPI
