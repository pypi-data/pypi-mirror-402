## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install adaptive-k-routing
```

```python
from adaptive_k import AdaptiveKRouter

# Load pre-calibrated router
router = AdaptiveKRouter.from_pretrained("mixtral-8x7b")

# Route tokens
indices, weights, metrics = router.route(router_logits, return_metrics=True)

print(f"Compute savings: {metrics.compute_savings:.1%}")
# Output: Compute savings: 47.2%
```

### With Observability Support

```bash
pip install adaptive-k-routing[observability]
```

## 📊 Proven Results

| Model | Savings | Quality Retained |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Mixtral 8x7B | **52.5%** | 99.8% |
| Qwen-MoE | **32.4%** | 99.9% |
| OLMoE-1B-7B | **24.7%** | 99.7% |

## 💡 How It Works

Adaptive-K dynamically selects the number of experts (K) based on **routing entropy**:

```
Low entropy (confident) → K=1 → 87.5% compute saved
Medium entropy         → K=2 → 75% compute saved  
High entropy (uncertain) → K=4 → Full routing
```

The key insight: when the router is confident, fewer experts are needed.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Routing

```python
from adaptive_k import AdaptiveKRouter

router = AdaptiveKRouter.from_pretrained("mixtral-8x7b")

# Your MoE router logits (batch_size, num_experts)
router_logits = model.router(hidden_states)

# Adaptive-K routing
expert_indices, expert_weights, _ = router.route(router_logits)

# Use selected experts
output = execute_experts(hidden_states, expert_indices, expert_weights)
```

### Custom Calibration

```python
from adaptive_k import Calibrator

calibrator = Calibrator(
    target_savings=0.40,      # 40% target savings
    quality_threshold=0.99    # Max 1% quality loss
)

result = calibrator.calibrate(
    model=your_model,
    dataset=calibration_data
)

print(f"Optimal thresholds: {result.optimal_thresholds}")
print(f"Expected savings: {result.expected_savings:.1%}")
```

### Check Statistics

```python
# After processing many tokens
print(router.stats)
# {
#   'tokens_processed': 1_234_567,
#   'average_savings': 0.472,
#   'estimated_cost_reduction': '47.2%'
# }
```

## 🔧 Configuration

```python
from adaptive_k import AdaptiveKRouter, RoutingConfig

config = RoutingConfig(
    k_values=[1, 2, 4],           # Available K values
    entropy_thresholds=[0.6, 1.2], # H < 0.6 → K=1, H < 1.2 → K=2, else K=4
    num_experts=8
)

router = AdaptiveKRouter(config=config)
```
