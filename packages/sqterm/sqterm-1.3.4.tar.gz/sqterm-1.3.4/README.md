## 🔧 Making your own commands

To make your own command simply create a .py file titled **exactly** what the user has to type to execute the command.

Each command consists of two required functions:
- `info()` – returns a short description of the command
- `main(state, i)` – contains the command logic

Example of an `info()` function:

```py
def info():
    return '"IMPORTCSV" - Imports a CSV file as a new table'
```

Example of a `main()` function:

```py
def main(state, i):
    print("Hello from this command!")
```

If your script needs access to things such as the database path, the SQLite connection, or the cursor, you can retrieve them from the state argument:

```py
name = state["name"]
conn = state["conn"]
cursor = state["cursor"]
```
If you need the raw user input that triggered the command, you can access it via the i argument passed into main().
Once you've written your command simply drop it into the `commands` folder, start SQTerm and your command should work seamlessly when executed (you can also type `help` to see if your command shows up)

It is recommended to use autocompletion if your addon requires the user to input columns, tables, etc. You can use the built-in autocompletion by importing its `CACHE` variable via:
```py 
from sqterm.extras.autocomplete import CACHE
```

If there's anything you'd like to be autocompleted simply append it to the cache using `CACHE.append(ITEM)`, before the addon finishes also make sure to clear the cache using `CACHE.clear()`.
