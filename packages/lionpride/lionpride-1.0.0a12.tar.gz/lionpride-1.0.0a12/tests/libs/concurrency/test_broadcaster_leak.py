"""Test Broadcaster class-level subscription leak - Issue #24.

Broadcaster uses ClassVar[list] for _subscribers, combined with singleton pattern.
This creates a WORSE leak than EventBus because:
1. Subscribers are class-level (not instance-level)
2. Singleton pattern means one instance persists forever
3. All subclasses share the same subscriber list

Without weakref, handlers accumulate across agent lifecycles, tenant boundaries, etc.
