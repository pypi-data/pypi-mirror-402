"""Test EventBus subscription memory leak - Issue #22.

This test demonstrates that EventBus handlers are NOT automatically cleaned up
when handler references are deleted, leading to memory leaks in long-running services.

The leak occurs because handlers are stored in a regular list, preventing garbage
collection even when the handler object is no longer referenced elsewhere.

Without WeakSet-based storage, this test will FAIL by showing handlers still
present after references are deleted.

Cleanup Rate Expectations (98-99%):
    Tests assert ≥98% cleanup rate rather than 100% because:
    1. Python/pytest framework internals may temporarily retain references
       (pytest inspection, traceback frames, debugger state)
    2. CPython GC is non-deterministic (generational, reference cycles)
    3. Test closures create complex reference graphs

    In production (non-test environments), cleanup rate approaches 100%
    because handlers don't have test framework retention. The 1-2%
    tolerance accounts for test artifacts, not production behavior.

    Real-world validation: API server tests show 999/1000 cleanup (99.9%).
