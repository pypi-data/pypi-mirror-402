def find_package_file(filename: str, kind: str = "config", platform: str | None = None) -> ResourcePath:
    """Find a package file from a set of candidate locations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : `str`
        The unqualified name of a file to locate.

    kind : `str`
        The name of a subdirectory in which to look for the file within a
        package location, relative to an ``etc/`` directory.

    platform : `str` | `None`
        The name of a platform plugin in which to look for the file, or `None`
        if no platform plugin should be searched.

    Returns
    -------
    `lsst.resources.ResourcePath`

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If a requested file object cannot be located in the candidate hierarchy

    Notes
    -----
    The candidate locations are, in descending order of preference:
    - An ``.lsst`` directory in the user's home directory.
    - An ``lsst`` directory in the user's ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` directory
    - An ``etc/{kind}`` directory in the EUPS stack environment for the
      platform.
    - An ``etc/{kind}`` directory in the current Python environment/venv shared
      data directory.
    - An ``etc/{kind}`` directory in an installed ``lsst.ctrl.platform.*``
      package.
    - An ``etc/{kind}`` directory in the ``lsst.ctrl.execute`` package.
