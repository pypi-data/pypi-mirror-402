----------

**Python 3.10 or higher is required**

To install the library, you can just run the following command:

.. note::

    A `Virtual Environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ is recommended to install
    the library, especially on Linux where the system Python is externally managed and restricts which
    packages you can install on it.


.. code:: sh

    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m pip install -U requestcord

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U requestcord


Quick Example
--------------

.. code:: py

    from requestcord import SyncClient, JoinGuildPayload
    
    client = SyncClient()
    
    resp = client.guilds.join(
        payload=JoinGuildPayload(
            invite_code="YOUR_INVITE_CODE",
            token="YOUR_TOKEN"
        )
    )
