# Loading experimental data is necessary for model validation or calibration.
# In general, the raw experimental data is not directly compatible with VIMS tools.
# In addition, at least two types of experimental data can be considered:
#   - a collection of validation points defined by its nominal values.
#   - a collection of validation points with repeats: the experiment
#     is repeated several times for the same nominal values. Each repeat captures
#     some variability in the material properties and some uncertainties in the
#     experimental set-up. Some input and output variables are measured for each repeat.
#
# The conversion from raw to VIMS-compatible data should consider the following
# requirements:
#   - conversion of data with repeats to nominal values, by considering the mean
#     value of the measured data for each validation point.
#   - presence of vectors among the measured or nominal data. For instance,
#     experiments on composites material generally define a stacking sequence
#     (layup), which is an array of ply angles. We assume that the vectors are specified
#     as strings, through an encoding procedure. Typically, ``[0.0, 5.0, 8.9]`` is
#     encoded as ``'0.0_5.0_8.9'``. NumPy string representation of array can also be used.
#
# Let's consider a non-trivial experimental data containing several validation points,
# with several repeats for each, and a vector variable ``layup``.
raw_file = Path("dummy_experimental_data.csv")
read_csv(raw_file, delimiter=SEP)

# %%
# The ``read_nominal_values`` function allows to load the raw data
# and returns nominal values.
# The ``master_name`` is the name of the variable that is used to identify the
# validation points: each validation point has the same ``master_name`` value,
# and this value is unique among the validation points.
# The ``additional_names`` are variables added to the nominal values. Their values is
# computed as the mean value of all the repeats for each validation point.
# In case the raw data names do not match the model variable names,
# a renaming can be done with ``name_remapping``.
# Finally, most VIMS tools use a GEMSEO Dataset as input.
# GEMSEO Datasets are multi-index column Pandas DataFrame, allowing to properly
# handle data by groups and by component (useful to handle vectors).
# Here, the nominal values are returned as a GEMSEO Dataset.
# In this case, the following additional arguments are necessary:
#  - a mapping between scalar variable names and group names, to specify in which groups
#    the variables are placed,
#  - a mapping between vector names and group names. Vectors are thus identified,
#    and are decoded as numerical arrays in the Dataset. For example,
#    ``'0.0_5.0_8.9'`` is stored as a variable having three components.
