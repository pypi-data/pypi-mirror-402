Uncertainty Quantification

-  b-value
    Material tests are subjected to uncertainties
    due to variability in material properties
    or test bench.
    In general, several tests are repeated on a batch of material.
    B-value is an estimator of a ten percent quantile of a material property.
    It takes into account the fact that the number of tests
    may not be sufficient to obtain converged statistics.
    The tests may measure deformation against applied force.
    Based on several curves, the maximum force value above which plastic deformation occurs
    can be estimated.
    Different values of this maximum force are obtained on a batch.
    B-value allows to estimated a conservative maximum force value
    taking into account variability in testing and material properties.
