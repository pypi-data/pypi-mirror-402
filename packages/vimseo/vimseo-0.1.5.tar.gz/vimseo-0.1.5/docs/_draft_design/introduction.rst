Overview
========

An objective is to link closely the implementation of the mechanical model
with its definition and the modeling hypothesis.
These hypothesis and definitions may be:

  - geometrical
  - numerical
  - applicablity domain
  - physical (material)

The notion of load case was introduced in |v|
to represent a set of geometrical configurations,
each corresponding to a type boundary condition
for the mechanical model.
It may be seen as a categorical variable among
the other (continuous) variables that parametrize the model.
It is also useful to link the model to a given test
(typically coupon tests).

The following concepts may be useful to intoduce into |v|:

  - ``Material``
  - ``BoundaryCondition``
  - ``Field``, with a ``Scalar``, ``1D``, ``2D`` declination
  - ``Mesh``

The objective is not that |v| proposes some post-processing on these ``Fields``
(on the sense of slicing, cutting, averaging etc...).
Rather, |v| should be able to read ``Fields`` (obtained from user scripts)
and provide some storage and plotting capabilities.
These capabilities should take into account temporal data.

Lower priority needs may be to:

  - convert some model for another mechanical solver (Abaqus to Nastran for instance)
  - transfer the Jacobian matrix from the mechanical solver
    to an MDO scenario or sensitivity analysis.
