    abstract = "{This paper discusses the application of the Area Metric to the quantification of modeling errors. The focus of the discussion is the effect of the shape of the two distributions on the result produced by the Area Metric. Two different examples that assume negligible experimental and numerical errors are presented: the first case has experimental and simulated quantities of interest defined by normal distributions that require the definition of a mean value and a standard deviation; the second example is taken from the V\&amp;V10.1 ASME Standard that applies the Area Metric to quantify the modeling error of the tip deflection of a loaded hollow tapered cantilever beam simulated with the static Bernoulli-Euler beam theory.The first example, shows that relatively small differences between the mean values are sufficient for the area metric to be insensitive to the standard deviation. Furthermore, the example of the V\&amp;V10.1 ASME Standard produces an Area Metric equal to the difference between the mean values of experiments and simulations. Therefore, the error quantification is reduced to a single number that is obtained from a simple difference of two mean values. This means that the Area Metric fails to reflect a dependence for the difference in the shape of the distributions representing variability.The paper also presents an alternative version of the Area Metric that does not filter the effect of the shape of the distributions by utilizing a reference simulation that has the same mean value of the experiments. This means that the quantification of the modeling error will have contributions from the difference in mean values and from the shape of the distributions.}",

abstract = {Computational simulation can be defined as any computer application which involves the numerical solution to a system of partial differential equations. In this paper, a broad overview is given of verification procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of verification examined are code verification and solution verification. Code verification is a set of procedures developed to find coding mistakes that affect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy verification is recommended for code verification, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution verification is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-off and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh refinement.}

abstract = {This paper presents a multiscale progressive failure approach for composite materials which allows predicting the failure of a laminate from the thermo-mechanical properties (behaviour and strength) of the individual unidirectional plies. This kind of approach is predictive for different laminate layups and takes also into account the effects of ply failures on the macroscopic behaviour and the final laminate failure. For the first time to our knowledge, the viscosity of the matrix was introduced into the model for a more realistic description of the mesoscopic behaviour, especially for the non-linearity under shear loading. The mesoscopic failure criterion is based on physical principles and makes a distinction between the fibre failure and the interfibre failure modes. In order to describe the progressive failure of a laminate (ply after ply), a progressive degradation model, based on thermodynamical damage models, was developed. The definition of the final failure is also improved in order to predict the final failure more accurately, especially for [±θ]s laminates. Finally, some results (stress vs. strain laminate responses and macroscopic failure envelopes) are presented and compared with test data found in the literature.}

abstract = {A continuum damage model for the prediction of the onset and evolution of intralaminar failure mechanisms and the collapse of structures manufactured in fiber-reinforced plastic laminates is proposed. The failure mechanisms occurring in the longitudinal and transverse directions of a ply are represented by a set of scalar damage variables. Crack closure effects under load reversal are taken into account by using damage variables that are established as a function of the sign of the components of the stress tensor. Damage activation functions based on the LaRC04 failure criteria are used to predict the different failure mechanisms occurring at the ply level.}
