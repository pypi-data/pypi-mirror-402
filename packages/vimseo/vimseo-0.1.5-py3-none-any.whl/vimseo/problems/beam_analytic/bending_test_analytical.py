    """This model represents a straight beam subjected to different bending load cases
    and boundary conditions. It is based on Bernouilli hypothesis.

    Possible load cases are:
    - Cantilever: clamped at one end, and displacement applied on the beam according to
    the relative_dplt_location attribute.
    - ThreePoints: displacement applied on the beam according to the
    relative_dplt_location attribute and support location according to the
    relative_support_location attribute.

    Input parameters are geometry of the section, Young's modulus, length of the beam,
    the relative displacement location, the relative support location (for the
    ThreePoints load case) and the load case name.

    Output parameters are the maximum displacement in the direction of the loading, the
    location of this maximum displacement, the maximum reaction forces, the displacement
    and the moment fields and the displacement at the maximum reaction forces.

    We suppose that positive force is upwards. The imposed displacement is downwards.
