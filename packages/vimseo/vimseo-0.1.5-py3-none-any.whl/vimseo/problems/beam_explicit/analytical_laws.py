"""The below ``AnalyticDiscipline`` implement explicit analytical laws for some output
variables of the ``BendingTestAnalytical``.

The underlying physics is exactly the same
as the ``BendingTestAnalytical`` for:
 - Cantilever load case
 - ThreePoints load case under the following boundary conditions:
    - "relative_dplt_location" = 0.5
    - "relative_support_location" = [0.0, 1.0]

These disciplines can serve as reference models for validation or verification.
