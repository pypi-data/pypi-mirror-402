`himena` is an infinitely extensible and reusable applications framework for data
science.

<details><summary><b>Motivation</b></summary>

There are many GUI applications for data science, and many of them use the "plugin
system" to extend their functionality. Even though the plugin system is a good idea,
there are plenty of duplicated works in the third-party plugins.

The reason is that **plugins cannot extend other plugins**. Imagine that you are a
plugin developer and making a plugin that extract features from images as a table. To
make your plugin more useful, you will need to implement not only the table widget, but
filter/sort functions, plotting functions, and I/O functions as well. You will also be
sad to find that these functions cannot readily be used in other plugins.

`himena` is designed so that **plugins developers can cooperate with each other**. The
table widgets you implemented in your plugin can be used by other plugins that return a
tabular data. The plotting functions you implemented in your plugin can be used from
any table widgets implemented in other plugins.
