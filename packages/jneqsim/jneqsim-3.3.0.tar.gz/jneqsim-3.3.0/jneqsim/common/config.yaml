# NeqSim Dependency Configuration
# This file defines how to resolve NeqSim Java dependencies

neqsim:
  # Version to use (specific version that has been tested with this jneqsim release)
  # This version is automatically updated by the CI/CD pipeline when a new NeqSim release is published
  version: "3.3.0"

  # Fallback version when GitHub API is unavailable (rate limited, network issues)
  # This should be the previous tested version, providing a safety fallback mechanism
  # The CI/CD pipeline automatically sets this to the previous version when updating
  fallback_version: "3.0.43"

      # JAR file patterns for different Java versions

      # (e.g., Java21-Java21, Java21) to handle variations
