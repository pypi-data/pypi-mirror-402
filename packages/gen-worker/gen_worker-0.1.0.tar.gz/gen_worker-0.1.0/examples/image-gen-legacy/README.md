Legacy-style image generation example (typed stub).

Contents:

- `src/image_gen` with a placeholder @worker_function that expects a pipeline.
- `pyproject.toml` with deps.
- `[tool.cozy]` deployment config in `pyproject.toml`.

Notes:

- This example demonstrates dynamic checkpoint selection via `model_ref`.
- Replace the stub body with real diffusers inference if needed.
