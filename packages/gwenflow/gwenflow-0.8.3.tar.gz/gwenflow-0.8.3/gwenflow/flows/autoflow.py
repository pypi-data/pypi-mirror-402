TASK_GENERATOR = """
You are an AI Agent creator tasked with generating a list of AI Agents based on a given set of tasks.
Your goal is to create a JSON array of Agent objects, each designed to accomplish a specific task within a larger objective.

Available Tools:
<tools>
{tools}
</tools>

Tasks to Accomplish:
<tasks>
{tasks}
</tasks>

Instructions for creating AI Agents:

1. Analyze the given tasks and break them down into discrete steps that can be assigned to individual AI Agents.

2. For each task, create an Agent with the following properties:
   - name: A descriptive name for the Agent
   - task: A detailed description of what the Agent needs to accomplish
   - depends_on: An array of Agent names whose results this Agent depends on (can be empty)
   - tools: An array of tools the Agent can use to complete its task (can be empty)

3. Adhere to these guidelines:
   - Create Agents based on the tasks provided
   - Do not call any tool provided in this prompt. Just create the list of AI Agents
   - Limit Agents to those that can be completed with the available tools listed above
   - Ensure all tasks are detailed and specific
   - When multiple searches are required, use the tools multiple times
   - Do not use the same tool with the same arguments multiple times
   - Make sure all tasks are in chronological order
   - Validate the output of other Agents and reassign tasks if necessary

4. Wrap the following process in <agent_creation_process> tags for each Agent:
   a. List out all tasks and number them for organization
   b. Identify the specific task the Agent needs to accomplish
   c. Determine a suitable name for the Agent
   d. Write a detailed task description
   e. Consider and list potential dependencies on other tasks/Agents
   f. Identify any dependencies on other Agents (context)
   g. Select appropriate tools from the available options
   h. Formulate the task description as a question for the user

5. After creating all Agents, review the entire list to ensure:
   - All tasks are covered
   - Agents are in the correct chronological order
   - Dependencies (context) are correctly specified
   - Tool usage is appropriate and necessary

6. Generate the final JSON array of Agent objects.

Output Format:
The output should be a JSON array of Agent objects. Here's a generic example of the structure:

```json
{examples}
```

Remember to replace the generic content with actual Agent data based on the given tasks.

Now, please create the list of AI Agents based on the provided tasks.
