Dataset
=======

We aim to provide regular exports of the Software Heritage graph in two
different formats:

- **Columnar data storage**: a set of relational tables stored in a columnar
  format such as `Apache ORC <https://orc.apache.org/>`_, which is particularly
  suited for scale-out analyses on data lakes and big data processing
  ecosystems such as the Hadoop environment.

- **Compressed graph**: a compact and highly-efficient representation of the
  graph dataset, suited for scale-up analysis on high-end machines with large
  amounts of memory. The graph is compressed in *Boldi-Vigna representation*,
  designed to be loaded by the `WebGraph framework
  <https://webgraph.di.unimi.it/>`_, specifically using our `swh-graph
  library <https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-graph/index.html>`_.

See also :ref:`using-swh-data`.

.. admonition:: Terms of Use
   :name: remember-the-tos
   :class: important

   Usage of the datasets from the Software Heritage archive is covered by
   our `Ethical Charter`_ and the `Terms of use for bulk access`_.

Downloading the datasets
------------------------

All datasets below are available publicly and with no login required, subject
to the terms of use above.
After installing `awscli`_, datasets hosted on Amazon S3 can be downloaded
with this command::

    aws s3 cp s3://softwareheritage/graph/... ./target/path/ --recursive --no-sign-request

The latest **compressed graphs** contain some ``.zst`` files, which must be
decompressed with ``unzstd`` before they can be used with swh-graph.

Changelog
---------

- Graphs **2024-05-16, 2024-08-23, 2024-12-06, 2025-05-18** and their related history-hosting
  and teaser graphs were compressed inefficiently, causing their ``.graph`` and ``.ef``
  files to be 40% thand they should be.
  This issue was fixed in the 2025-10-08 graph.
  This does not affect their correctness.
- **2024-08-23** and newer: starting with this graph, the MPH changed from GOV/Cmph to PTHash.
  Rust code hardcoding ``GOVMPH`` needs to replace it with ``DynMph`` or ``SwhidPthash``.
  Java is no longer supported to read this graph.

Because of their size, some of the latest datasets are only available for
download from Amazon S3.

- **Compressed graph**:

  - **Total size**: 15 TiB
  - **S3**: ``s3://softwareheritage/graph/2025-10-08/compressed``

- **"History and hosting" Compressed graph**:

  - This is a compressed graph of only the "history and hosting" layer (origins,

  - **S3**: ``s3://softwareheritage/graph/2025-10-08-history-hosting/compressed``

- Erratum: this graph was published on 2025-12-08T12:35Z. On the same day, we found a defect that
  causes the compression of the ``.graph`` files in these graphs (and their respective ``.ef`` index)
  to be 40% larger than they should be.
  Even though this did not affect their correctness, we reuploaded better compressed files on 2025-12-08
  between 16:00Z and 19:00Z.
