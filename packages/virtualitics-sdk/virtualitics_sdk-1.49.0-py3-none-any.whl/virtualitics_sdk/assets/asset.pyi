class Asset:
    '''
    Class for storing objects along with their metadata. Supported object types are AssetTypes.
    Assets are created by specifying the type of object being stored and a label for the object.
    The label is intended to describe objects relevant to a specific project, an example would be
    \'Jet Engine subsystem N41\'. An additional name can be specified to differentiate between different
    versions of a specific object. Assets can be stored and retrieved through the store interface.
    Assets also allow users to write any notes/important information relevant to an object.
    They can also be linked to other persistence or asset objects, such as linking a model
    to the dataset it was trained on.

    The `type` field describes what kind of object is being stored. Please see the
    :class:`~virtualitics_sdk.assets.asset.AssetType` class for the full list of available AssetTypes. In order to
    store a generic python object, please create an asset with this class with type `AssetType.OTHER`.

    :param object: The object which is stored by the asset.
    :param label: Label for the object, can be used later to identify the object.
    :param type: The type of object being stored.
    :param metadata: Any additional metadata to be stored along with the object.
    :param name: Identifier to differentiate Assets with the same label.
    :param description: A description of the asset.
    :param version: Version of the asset.

    **EXAMPLE:**

       .. code-block:: python

           # Imports
           from virtualitics_sdk import Asset, AssetType
           . . .

           acc = Asset(object=[1, 2, 3], label="ex", type=AssetType.OTHER, name="ex-1")
