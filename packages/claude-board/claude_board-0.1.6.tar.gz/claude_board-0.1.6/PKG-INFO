# Claude Board

A permission approval console for Claude Code - approve or deny permission requests from your phone or (future) a physical hardware device.

## Requirements

> **Important**: Claude Board requires **Claude Code CLI in terminal** for full functionality.

### Environment Compatibility

| Environment | Permission Approval | TODO Tracking | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| Terminal (`claude` command) | ✅ Full support | ✅ Full support | Recommended |
| VS Code Extension | ⚠️ Known bug | ✅ Works | See below |
| Claude Desktop (CLI mode) | ⚠️ Known bug | ✅ Works | See below |
| Claude Desktop (Chat interface) | ❌ Not supported | ❌ Not supported | Different architecture |

### Known Issue: PermissionRequest Hook Bug

**The `PermissionRequest` hook does not trigger in VS Code Extension and Claude Desktop's built-in CLI.** This is a known upstream bug in Claude Code:

- [Issue #13203](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13203) - PermissionRequest hook does not trigger in VSCode extension
- [Issue #17036](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17036) - VS Code extension does not trigger hooks during permission prompt
- [Issue #13339](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13339) - VS Code Extension ignores hook `permissionDecision: "ask"`

**Workaround**: Use Claude Code in terminal (`claude` command) for full permission approval functionality. TODO tracking works in all CLI environments.

### Why doesn't Claude Desktop chat work at all?

Claude Desktop's chat interface and Claude Code CLI are completely different products:

- **Claude Code CLI** uses `~/.claude/settings.json` and supports **Hooks**
- **Claude Desktop Chat** uses `claude_desktop_config.json` and supports **MCP Servers** only

The chat interface has no "permission request" concept, so hooks cannot intercept anything.

## Features

- **Web UI**: Approve/deny requests from any device with a browser (phone, tablet, desktop)
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket-based instant notifications
- **Sound & vibration**: Get alerted when permission is needed
- **YOLO mode**: Auto-approve all requests with one click
- **TODO tracking**: See Claude's task list in real-time
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Y/Enter to approve, N/Escape to deny

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install claude-board
```

### Using uv

```bash
uv tool install claude-board
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pescn/claude-board.git
cd claude-board
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install hooks into Claude Code

```bash
claude-board install
```

This adds hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Your existing hooks are preserved.

### 2. Start the server

```bash
claude-board serve
```

### 3. Open the URL on your phone

The server will display a URL like `http://192.168.x.x:8765` - open it on your phone.

### 4. Restart Claude Code

Claude Code needs to be restarted to load the new hooks.

That's it! Now when Claude Code needs permission to run a command, you'll get a notification on your phone.

## Commands

```bash
# Start the web server
claude-board serve [--port 8765] [--open]

# Install hooks (preserves existing hooks)
claude-board install [--scope user|local]

# Uninstall hooks
claude-board uninstall [--scope user|local] [--all]

# Check status
claude-board status

# View/modify configuration
claude-board config [--port PORT] [--yolo/--no-yolo]

# Show version
claude-board --version
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CLAUDE_BOARD_HOST`: Server host (default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `CLAUDE_BOARD_PORT`: Server port (default: `8765`)

### Safe Tools (Auto-Approved)

These tools are automatically approved without sending to your phone:

- `Glob`, `Grep` - File searching
- `TodoWrite`, `TodoRead` - Task management
- `Task` - Subagent tasks
- `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` - Web operations
- `Read` (within project directory)

### Dangerous Tools (Require Approval)

- `Bash` - Shell commands
- `Write` - Creating/overwriting files
- `Edit` - Modifying files

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 (Current): Web UI ✅

Pure software solution with web-based approval.

### Phase 1: Raspberry Pi (Planned)

Physical console with:
- Mechanical key switches (Approve, Deny, Retry, YOLO)
- E-ink display for task status
- Wired connection

### Phase 2: Bluetooth (Planned)

Wireless physical console with BLE connectivity.

### Phase 3: ESP32 Standalone (Planned)

Battery-powered portable device.

## Development

```bash
# Clone and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/pescn/claude-board.git
cd claude-board
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Start server in development
claude-board serve --port 8765
```
