## A quick introduction to the format
```yaml
require:
  - weld_deps
## The dict way
meta:
  weld_deps:
    default_source: "smithed" # This is not needed, smithed is the default for default_source
    deps:
      smithed.crafter.dev: # You can provide a version by a dict
        version: "0.4.0"
      itemio: "1.0.0" # Or by a string
## The list way
meta:
  weld_deps:
    default_source: "modrinth" # This is needed if you want to work with modrinth deps as default
    deps:
      - id: player_motion
        version: "1.3.1"
        source: "smithed"
      - id: code-of-copper # The source is automaticly to modrinth
        version: "0.3.0"
## Multiple sources
meta:
  weld_deps:
    deps:
      player_motion: "1.3.1"
      code-of-copper:
        version: "0.3.0"
        source: "modrinth"
