# TIMESAT CLI

`TIMESAT CLI` is a command line interface and workflow manager for the [TIMESAT](https://pypi.org/project/timesat/) package. 
It provides a convenient way to configure and execute TIMESAT processing pipelines directly from the command line or automated scripts. 

---

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** (for environment management)  
  Download: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- **Python 3.10+**

---

## Installation

`timesat-cli` is available on **PyPI** and can be installed using **pip** or **uv**.  
Although it is not published on Conda, you can safely install it *inside* a Conda environment.

### Option 1 — Install inside a Conda environment

```bash
conda create -n timesat-cli python=3.12
conda activate timesat-cli
pip install timesat-cli
```

> This approach uses Conda only for environment isolation.  
> The installation itself is handled by pip, which will automatically install `timesat` and all required dependencies.

---

### Option 2 — Install via uv (recommended for pure Python environments)

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern, high-performance alternative to pip and venv.

1. Install `uv`:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   # or
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the package:

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install timesat-cli
   ```

> `uv` provides faster dependency resolution and caching.  
> It will automatically install `timesat` and related dependencies.

---

### Option 3 — Direct installation with pip

If you already have Python 3.10+ installed:

```bash
pip install timesat-cli
```

---


## Running the Application

After installation, start the CLI with:

```bash
timesat-cli path/to/settings.json
```

or equivalently:

```bash
python -m timesat_cli path/to/settings.json
```

---

## Advanced Usage

If you wish to customize or extend the workflow, you can also run or modify the main script directly:

```bash
python timesat_run.py
```

The file 'timesat_run.py' contains the full example pipeline that invokes core modules from the 'timesat_cli' package, including configuration loading, file management, TIMESAT processing, and output writing.

## HRVPP Notes — QFLAG2 weights
If you work with HRVPP quality flags (`QFLAG2`), the following weights `w` are commonly applied:

| QFLAG2 value | Weight `w` |
|---:|---:|
| 1     | 1.0 |
| 4097  | 1.0 |
| 8193  | 1.0 |
| 12289 | 1.0 |
| 1025  | 0.5 |
| 9217  | 0.5 |
| 2049  | 0.5 |
| 6145  | 0.5 |
| 3073  | 0.5 |

Example (settings.json):

```python
"p_a": {
  "value": [
    [1, 1.0],
    [4097, 1.0],
    [8193, 1.0],
    [12289, 1.0],
    [1025, 0.5],
    [9217, 0.5],
    [2049, 0.5],
    [6145, 0.5],
    [3073, 0.5]
  ],
  "description": "QA weighting rules. Leave empty [] to keep original QA values. Use [qa_value, weight] for exact matches or [min, max, weight] for ranges."
}
```
