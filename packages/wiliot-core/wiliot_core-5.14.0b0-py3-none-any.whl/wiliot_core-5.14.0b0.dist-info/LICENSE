THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY WILIOT "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, QUIET POSSESSION, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL WILIOT, ANY OF ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, AND/OR ANY CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, FOR ANY LOSS OF USE OR DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND/OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC LOSS (SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS). THE FOREGOING SHALL APPLY: (A) HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OR BASIS LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE); (B) EVEN IF ANYONE IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR COSTS; AND (C) EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

If any provision of this license is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) the remaining provisions of this license shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) both you and Wiliot agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace the provision with a provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision, and this license shall be enforceable as so modified in respect of such jurisdiction. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it as aforesaid, then such provision will be ineffective solely as to such jurisdiction (and only to the extent and for the duration of such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability), and will be substituted (in respect of such jurisdiction) with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision. Any waiver under this license must be in a signed writing.
