    **Coding Standards & Style Guide**
        We strictly follow specific naming conventions to keep the library consistent. Please ensure your code adheres to these rules before submitting a PR.

    **Naming Conventions**
    * **Classes:** Use `CamelCase` (PascalCase).
        * *Correct:* `ProboButton`, `ViewRegistry`
        * *Incorrect:* `proboButton`, `view_registry`
        
    * **Functions & Variables:** Use `snake_case`.
        * *Correct:* `get_view_config()`, `user_id`
        * *Incorrect:* `getViewConfig()`, `UserId`

    * **Internal/Scoped Methods:**: Any function or method intended for internal use only (not part of the public API) must start with a single underscore `_`.
        * *Correct:* `def _resolve_url_name(self):`
        * *Incorrect:* `def resolve_url_name(self):` (If it is not meant for the user)
