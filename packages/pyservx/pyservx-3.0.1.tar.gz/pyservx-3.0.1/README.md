- **Split-Panel Layout** - File explorer (60%) and text clipboard (40%) side-by-side

- **Mobile Responsive** - Stacked layout on smaller screens

### Enhanced Features
- **Real-time Search** - Instant file filtering as you type (no page refresh needed)
- **Direct Media Downloads** - Images, videos, and audio files download directly instead of opening in browser

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install pyservx
```

Or use pipx for an isolated environment (recommended):

```bash
pipx install pyservx
```

Requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Usage

Run the server:

```bash
pyservx
```

Or with custom options:

```bash
pyservx --port 8080 --no-qr
```

- The server automatically creates a shared folder in your Downloads directory (`PyServeX-Shared`)
- Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8088` (or your custom port)
- Scan the QR code in the terminal to access from mobile devices
- Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
