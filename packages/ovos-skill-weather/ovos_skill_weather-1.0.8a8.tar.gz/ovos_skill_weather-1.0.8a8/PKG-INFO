Weather conditions and forecasts

## About 
Get weather conditions, forecasts, expected precipitation and more!  By default, it will tell
you about your device's configured location. You can also ask for other cities around the world. 

Current conditions and weather forecasts come from [OpenMeteo](https://open-meteo.com).

The temperature is shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on the preferences set in your configuration or skill settings.
You can ask specifically for a unit that differs from your configuration.

No API key or user accounts required
