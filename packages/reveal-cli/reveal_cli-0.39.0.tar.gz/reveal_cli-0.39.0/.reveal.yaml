# Reveal Project Configuration
# Version: v0.28.0+
# This config demonstrates reveal's configuration capabilities
# while ensuring the project itself passes quality checks.

root: true  # Stop searching upward for parent configs

# Rule configuration
rules:
  # Complexity thresholds - balanced for production code
  # Note: Infrastructure code (config.py) is inherently complex due to:
  #   - 7-level configuration precedence merging
  #   - Directory tree walking and config discovery
  #   - Environment variable parsing with validation
  C901:
    threshold: 21  # Cyclomatic complexity (default: 10)
                   # Allows infrastructure code patterns

  C905:
    MAX_DEPTH: 6   # Max nesting depth (default: 4)
                   # Allows directory tree walking patterns

  # Line length - reasonable for modern displays
  E501:
    max_length: 100  # Default is 100, made explicit

  # Function parameters
  R913:
    max_args: 5  # Default is 5, made explicit

  # Disable specific rules (currently none)
  # Uncomment and add rules as needed:
  # disable:
  #   - E501  # Line too long
  #   - C901  # Too complex
