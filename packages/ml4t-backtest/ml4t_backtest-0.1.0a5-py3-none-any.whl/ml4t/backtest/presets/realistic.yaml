# Realistic Configuration
#
# Conservative settings for production-like simulation.
# - INTEGER shares (like real brokers)
# - Next-bar execution (no look-ahead)
# - Higher costs (pessimistic estimates)
# - Extra stop slippage (gaps hurt in fast markets)
# - Cash buffer (margin of safety)
# - Smaller positions (risk management)
