## TOPSIS Implementation in Python

This package provides a Python implementation of the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method for multi-criteria decision making.

It offers a command-line interface (CLI) to evaluate and rank alternatives based on weighted criteria and their positive or negative impacts.

---

## What is TOPSIS?

TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making technique that ranks alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal best and ideal worst solutions.

The alternative with the highest TOPSIS score is considered the best choice.

## Features

- Command-line based implementation
- Accepts CSV input files
- Supports user-defined weights and impacts
- Generates TOPSIS score and rank for each alternative
- Robust input validation and error handling
