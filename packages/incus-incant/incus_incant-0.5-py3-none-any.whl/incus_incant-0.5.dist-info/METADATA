            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.
         
               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
               "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
               exercising permissions granted by this License.
         
               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Incant

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/incus-incant.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/incus-incant/)

Incant is a frontend for [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) that provides a declarative way to define and manage development environments. It simplifies the creation, configuration, and provisioning of Incus instances using YAML-based configuration files.

## Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define your development environments using simple YAML files.
- **Shared Folder Support**: Mount the current working directory into the instance.
- **Provisioning Support**: Declare and run provisioning scripts automatically, copy files to the instance, set up an SSH server automatically, and configure an LLMNR daemon.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed and `incus` available on your system.

You can install Incant from PyPI:

```sh
pipx install incus-incant
```

Or install directly from Git:

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/lnussbaum/incant.git
```

## Usage

### Install and configure Incus

[Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) is required by Incant. [Incus' documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/) describes how to install it, but in short, you can do:
```sh
# install Incus from your distribution's packages
apt-get -y install incus

# Configure Incus with default settings
incus admin init --auto

# Add yourself to the incus-admin group
usermod -a -G incus-admin <your_login>

# Gain the new group in the current shell (alternatively, you can log out and log in again)
newgrp incus-admin
```
### Configure Incant

Incant looks for a configuration file named `incant.yaml`, `incant.yaml.j2`, or `incant.yaml.mako` in the current directory.

You can ask Incant to create an example configuration file with:
```sh
$ incant init
```

A very basic example:
```yaml
instances:
  debian-sid:
    image: images:debian/14
```

Another example, that starts a KVM virtual machine:
```yaml
instances:
  debian-sid:
    image: images:debian/14
    vm: true
```

A more complex example that demonstrates most of Incant's features:
```yaml
instances:
  basic-container:
    image: images:ubuntu/24.04
    devices:
      root:
        size: 1GiB
    wait: true # wait for instance to be ready (incus agent running)
    shared_folder: false # disable shared folder (/incant) setup (default: enabled)
    config: # any incus config options
      limits.processes: 100
  basic-vm:
    image: images:ubuntu/24.04
    vm: true
    type: c1-m1 # 1 CPU, 1GB RAM
  provisioned:
    image: images:debian/13
    provision: # a list of provisioning steps
      - | # first, an inlined script
        #!/bin/bash
        set -xe
        apt-get update
        apt-get -y install curl ruby
      # then, a script. the path can be relative to the current dir,
      # as incant will 'cd' to /incant, so the script will be available inside the instance
      - examples/provision/web_server.rb
      - ssh: true # configure an ssh server and provide access
      # - ssh: # same with more configuration
      #    clean_known_hosts: true (that's the default)
      #    # authorized_keys: path to file (default: concatenate id_*.pub)
      - llmnr: true # configure and start an LLMNR daemon
      - copy: # copy a file using 'incus file push'
          source: ./README.md
          target: /tmp/README.md
          mode: "0644"
          uid: 0
          gid: 0
```

### Initialize and Start an Instance

```sh
$ incant up
```

or for a specific instance, if you have several instances described in your configuration file:

```sh
$ incant up my-instance
```

### Provision again an Instance that was already started previously

```sh
$ incant provision
```

or for a specific instance:

```sh
$ incant provision my-instance
```

### Use your Instances

Use [Incus commands](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/instances/) to interact with your instances:

```sh
$ incus exec ubuntu-container -- apt-get update
$ incus shell my-instance # or `incant shell` if you have a single instance
$ incus console my-instance
$ incus file edit my-container/etc/hosts
$ incus file delete <instance_name>/<path_to_file>
```

Your instance's services are directly reachable on the network. They should be discoverable in DNS if the instance supports [LLMNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution) or [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).

### Destroy an Instance

```sh
$ incant destroy
```

or for a specific instance:

```sh
$ incant destroy my-instance
```

### View Configuration (especially useful if you use Mako or Jinja2 templates)

```sh
$ incant dump
```

## Caveats

### Shared folders don't work on ARM64

This is known as [Incus issue #91](https://github.com/zabbly/incus/issues/91) and [virtiofsd issue #212](https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd/-/issues/212).

The default shared folder (/incant) can be disabled using:
```yaml
instances:
  my-instance:
    shared_folder: false
```

### Virtual machines (not containers) for RHEL-based distributions need an explicit agent:config device

This can be added using a pre-launch command, with:
```yaml
instances:
  alma9vm:
    image: images:almalinux/9
    vm: true
    pre-launch:
      - config device add alma9vm agent disk source=agent:config
```

See [Incus documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/devices_disk/)

### Name resolution (DNS) does not work for some images

Some images enable [LLMNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution) or [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), so that their names are automatically resolvable from the host. For others, a custom provisioning step (`- llmnr: true`) can be added to enable LLMNR in `systemd-resolved` at instance startup.
* Images that are known to work out of the box: debian/{11,12,13,14}, archlinux/current
* Images that are known to work with `llmnr: true`: ubuntu/{22.04,24.04}, almalinux/{8,9,10}

### No network connectivity when Docker is installed

If Docker is installed on the same machine as Incus is running on, started instances may not have
network connectivity. See the Incus documentation for how to mitigate that:
[Prevent connectivity issues with Incus and Docker](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/network_bridge_firewalld/#prevent-connectivity-issues-with-incus-and-docker)

## Incant compared to Vagrant

Incant is inspired by Vagrant, and intended as an Incus-based replacement for Vagrant.

The main differences between Incant and Vagrant are:

* Incant is Free Software (licensed under the Apache 2.0 license). Vagrant is licensed under the non-Open-Source Business Source License.
* Incant is only a frontend for [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/), which supports containers (LXC-based) and virtual machines (KVM-based) on Linux. It will not attempt to be a more generic frontend for other virtualization providers. Thus, Incant only works on Linux.

Some technical differences are useful to keep in mind when migrating from Vagrant to Incant.

* Incant is intended as a thin layer on top of Incus, and focuses on provisioning. Once the provisioning has been performed by Incant, you need to use Incus commands such as `incus shell` to work with your instances.
* Incant shares the current directory as `/incant` inside the instance (compared to Vagrant's sharing of `/vagrant`). Incant tries to share the current directory read-write (using Incus' `shift=true`) but this fails in some cases, such as restricted containers. So there are chances that the directory will only be shared read-only.
* Incant does not create a user account inside the instance -- you need to use the root account, or create a user account during provisioning (for example, with `adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" incant`)
* Incant uses a YAML-based description format for instances. [Mako](https://www.makotemplates.org/) or [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates can be used to those YAML configuration files if you need more complex processing, similar to what is available in *Vagrantfiles* (see the examples/ directory).

## Incant compared to other projects

There are several other projects addressing similar problem spaces. They are shortly described here so that you can determine if Incant is the right tool for you.

* [lxops](https://github.com/melato/lxops) and [blincus](https://blincus.dev/) manage the provisioning of Incus instances using a declarative configuration format, but the provisioning actions are described using  [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) configuration files. [lxops](https://github.com/melato/lxops) uses [cloudconfig](https://github.com/melato/cloudconfig) to apply them, while [blincus](https://blincus.dev/) requires *cloud* instances that include cloud-init. In contrast, using Incant does not require knowing about cloud-init or fitting into cloud-init's formalism.
* [terraform-provider-incus](https://github.com/lxc/terraform-provider-incus) is a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) provider for Incus. Incant uses a more basic scheme for provisioning, and does not require knowing about Terraform or fitting into Terraform's formalism.
* [cluster-api-provider-lxc (CAPL)](https://github.com/neoaggelos/cluster-api-provider-lxc) is an infrastructure provider for Kubernetes' Cluster API, which enables deploying Kubernetes clusters on Incus. Incant focuses on the more general use case of provisioning system containers or virtual machines outside of the Kubernetes world.
* [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) is a [Nix](https://nixos.org/)-based development environment manager. It also uses a declarative file format. It goes further than Incant by including the definition of development tasks. It also covers defining services that run inside the environment, and generating OCI containers to deploy the environment to production. Incant focuses on providing the environment based on classical Linux distributions and tools.
