## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- **Page range handling for start-page without end-page:** Fixed issue where `--start-page` without `--end-page` would fail
  - Now automatically detects total PDF page count using `pypdf`
  - Properly converts user-friendly 1-based page numbers to Marker's 0-based format
  - Example: `pdf2md-ocr input.pdf --start-page 223` now correctly processes from page 223 to the end
- **Improved system library error handling:** Better error messages when required system libraries (WeasyPrint dependencies) are missing
  - CLI now detects missing `libgobject-2.0`, `pango`, and other native dependencies
  - Provides clear, platform-specific installation instructions (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  - Links to System Requirements section in README for more details

### Added

- **System Requirements documentation:** New section in README explaining native library dependencies
  - Detailed installation steps for macOS (Homebrew), Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/RHEL, and Windows
  - Guidance for environment variable setup on macOS (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
- **Docker support:** Added `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for containerized usage and distribution
- **CI: Docker image workflow:** New `build-docker-image.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish Docker images
- **CI: Updated Python setup action:** Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use `actions/setup-python@v5`

[1.0.1]: https://github.com/carloscasalar/pdf2md-ocr/releases/tag/v1.0.1

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Pipe-friendly output:** `--stdout` flag to write Markdown to stdout for piping to other tools
  - Example: `pdf2md-ocr input.pdf --stdout | other-tool`
- **Quiet mode:** `--quiet` / `-q` flag to suppress progress messages
  - Useful in scripts and when piping output
- **Standalone cache info:** `--show-cache-info` can now run without INPUT_PDF
  - Check cache location and size: `pdf2md-ocr --show-cache-info`
  - No longer requires converting a PDF to view cache information

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/carloscasalar/pdf2md-ocr/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## [0.0.5] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- Fixed hanging issue when running `--help` or `--version` commands
  - Lazy-load marker modules only when actually converting PDFs
  - Commands like `uvx pdf2md-ocr --help` now run instantly instead of trying to load AI models

[0.0.5]: https://github.com/carloscasalar/pdf2md-ocr/releases/tag/v0.0.5

## [0.0.4] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- Page range extraction feature: convert only specific pages from a PDF
  - `--start-page N`: Start conversion from page N (1-based, inclusive)
  - `--end-page M`: End conversion at page M (1-based, inclusive)
  - Both options are optional and can be combined for flexible page selection
  - Page numbering starts at 1 (not 0)

[0.0.4]: https://github.com/carloscasalar/pdf2md-ocr/releases/tag/v0.0.4

## [0.0.3] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- Changed to a simpler implementation of `pdf2md-ocr`:
  - Optional output path specification with `-o` flag
  - Automatic output filename generation (input name with .md extension)

  - Version command `--version`
  - Help command `--help`
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Tests for PDF conversion functionality
- Tests for default output path behavior

### Technical Details

- Uses marker-pdf v1.10.1 for PDF conversion
- Built with Python 3.10+ support
- Uses uv for dependency management
- Uses hatchling as build backend
- Implements PyPI Trusted Publishers for secure publishing
- GPL-3.0-or-later licensed (required by marker-pdf dependency)
