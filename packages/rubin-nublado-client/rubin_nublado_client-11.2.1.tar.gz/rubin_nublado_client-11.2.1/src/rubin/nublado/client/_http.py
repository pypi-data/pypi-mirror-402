class JupyterAsyncClient:
    """Wrapper around an HTTP client with JupyterHub and JupyterLab support.

    The Nublado client, rather than using Jupyter access tokens, simulates a
    web browser when interacting with JupyterHub and JupyterLab. This requires
    some special handling:

    - An ``Authorization`` header must be set on every request to get past
      Gafaelfawr authentication.
    - The client needs a persistent cookie jar to handle XSRF cookies.
    - An additional ``X-XSRFToken`` header must be added to requests
      containing the XSRF token. (This is easier than trying to inject it
      into the query string or POST body.)
    - The XSRF token for the ``X-XSRFToken`` header must be extracted from
      the cookie jar, but it may only be present in some intermediate
      responses in redirect chains.
    - ``Sec-Fetch-Mode`` must be set to appropriate values on different
      requests to avoid annoying logs messages or XSRF validation failures.

    This wrapper around an HTTPX ``AsyncClient`` handles that complexity and
    exposes a simple API to the rest of the Nublado client.

    Parameters
    ----------
    discovery_client

    token
        Gafaelfawr token to use for authentication.
