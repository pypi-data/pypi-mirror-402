# Leaspy - LEArning Spatiotemporal Patterns in Python

Leaspy is a software package for the statistical analysis of **longitudinal data**, particularly **medical** data that comes in a form of **repeated observations** of patients at different time-points.

## Get started Leaspy

### Installation

Leaspy requires Python >= 3.9, <= 3.13.

Whether you wish to install a released version of Leaspy, or to install its development version, it is **highly recommended** to use a virtual environment to install the project and its dependencies.

There exists multiple solutions for that, the most common option is to use `conda`:

```bash
conda create --name leaspy python=3.10
conda activate leaspy
```

#### Install a released version

To install the latest version of Leaspy:

```bash
pip install leaspy
```

#### Install in development mode

If you haven't done it already, create and activate a dedicated environment.

**Clone the repository**

To install the project in development mode, you first need to get the source code by cloning the project's repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aramis-lab/leaspy.git
cd leaspy
```

**Install poetry**

This project relies on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) that you would need to install (see the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)).

It is recommended install it in a dedicated environment, separated from the one in which you will install Leaspy and its dependencies. One possibility is to install it with a tool called [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).

If you don't have `pipx` installed, already, you can follow the [official installation guidelines](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).

In short, you can do:

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

**Install Leaspy and its dependencies**

Install leaspy in development mode:

```bash
poetry install
```

**Install the pre-commit hook**

Once you have installed Leaspy in development mode, do not forget to install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook in order to automatically format and lint your commits:

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Examples & Tutorials

The `examples` folder contains a starting point if you want to launch your first scripts and notebook with the Leaspy package.

## Description
Leaspy is a software package for the statistical analysis of **longitudinal data**, particularly **medical** data that comes in a form of **repeated observations** of patients at different time-points.
Considering these series of short-term data, the software aims at :
- recombining them to reconstruct the long-term spatio-temporal trajectory of evolution
- positioning each patient observations relatively to the group-average timeline, in terms of both temporal differences (time shift and acceleration factor) and spatial differences (different sequences of events, spatial pattern of progression, ...)
- quantifying impact of cofactors (gender, genetic mutation, environmental factors, ...) on the evolution of the signal
- imputing missing values
- predicting future observations
- simulating virtual patients to un-bias the initial cohort or mimics its characteristics

The software package can be used with scalar multivariate data whose progression can be described by a logistic model, linear, joint or mixture model.
The simplest type of data handled by the software are scalar data: they correspond to one (univariate) or multiple (multivariate) measurement(s) per patient observation.
This includes, for instance, clinical scores, cognitive assessments, physiological measurements (e.g. blood markers, radioactive markers) but also imaging-derived data that are rescaled, for instance, between 0 and 1 to describe a logistic progression.

### Main features
- `fit` : determine the **population parameters** that describe the disease progression at the population level
- `personalize` : determine the **individual parameters** that characterize the individual scenario of feature progression
- `estimate` : evaluate the feature values of a patient at any age, either for missing value imputation or future prediction
- `simulate` : generate synthetic data from the model
