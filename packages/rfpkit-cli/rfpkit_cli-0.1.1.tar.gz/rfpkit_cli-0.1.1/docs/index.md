# RFP Kit

*Win more proposals with AI-powered response development.*

**A structured framework for developing high-quality RFP responses using AI agents.**

## What is RFP Kit?

RFP Kit provides a systematic approach to proposal development that ensures compliance, competitive positioning, and quality. Instead of starting with a blank page, you work through a structured workflow: analyze the RFP, create guidelines, develop win strategy, draft sections with evidence, and verify compliance. AI agents guide you through each step, ensuring nothing is missed.
