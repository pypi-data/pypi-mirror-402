## 🎯 Core Response Principles

### 1. Compliance First
- **Every requirement must be addressed** - No gaps, no assumptions
- **Use RFP terminology** - Mirror their language, not ours
- **Follow instructions exactly** - Format, page limits, delivery method
- **Track mandatory vs. desirable** - Distinguish "must-have" from "nice-to-have"

### 2. Evidence-Based Claims
- **Every claim needs proof** - No unsubstantiated assertions
- **Quantify whenever possible** - Use metrics, percentages, timelines
- **Provide references** - Past performance examples, case studies
- **Show, don't just tell** - Demonstrate capabilities with concrete examples

### 3. Client-Centric Language
- **Focus on their outcomes** - What they achieve, not what we do
- **Address their pain points** - Speak to their specific challenges
- **Use benefits language** - "You will be able to..." not "We provide..."
- **Avoid vendor jargon** - Clear, accessible language

### 4. Evaluator-Friendly Format
- **Scannable structure** - Clear headers, bullets, white space
- **Front-load key info** - Answer first, details second
- **Cross-reference requirements** - Make compliance easy to verify
- **Consistent formatting** - Professional, uniform appearance
