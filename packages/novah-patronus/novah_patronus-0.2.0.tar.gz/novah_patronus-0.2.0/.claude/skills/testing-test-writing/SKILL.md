description: Write tests for Django applications using pytest-django, factory_boy, and DRF's APITestCase following project testing conventions. Use this skill when writing unit tests, API tests, or integration tests, creating test factories with factory_boy, mocking external services, testing Django models or views, using pytest fixtures, optimizing test performance, or working on files in tests/ directories or named test_*.py.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When writing new test cases for models, views, or services
- When creating test factories with factory_boy
- When writing API tests using DRF's APITestCase or pytest
- When using pytest.mark.django_db for database access
- When creating pytest fixtures for test setup
- When mocking external services with unittest.mock
- When testing query performance with assertNumQueries
- When configuring pytest.ini or settings/test.py
- When organizing tests in the tests/ directory structure
- When writing tests that use force_authenticate for API testing
- When implementing test isolation and independence
- When running tests with coverage reporting
- When working on files named test_*.py, *_tests.py, or conftest.py
- When deciding what to test vs what to skip (test behavior, not implementation)
