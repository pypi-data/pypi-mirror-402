name: global-commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain complex logic without cluttering the codebase. Use this skill when deciding whether to add comments to code, writing comments for complex algorithms or business logic, avoiding unnecessary comments that explain obvious code, ensuring comments are evergreen and not temporary notes about recent changes, or reviewing code for comment quality.

## When to use this skill:

- When deciding whether a piece of code needs a comment
- When writing comments for complex or non-obvious logic
- When avoiding comments that simply restate what the code does
- When ensuring comments explain "why" rather than "what"
- When removing outdated or misleading comments
- When writing code that should be self-documenting through clear naming
- When reviewing pull requests for appropriate comment usage
- When refactoring code to reduce the need for explanatory comments
- When documenting business rules that aren't obvious from the code
- When avoiding temporary comments about fixes or changes
