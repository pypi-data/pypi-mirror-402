class MiddlewareServerSession(ServerSession):
    """Extended ServerSession that routes initialize requests through middleware.

    This class intercepts the MCP initialize handshake at the protocol layer,
    allowing middleware to:
    - Validate client capabilities or metadata during connection
    - Log connection attempts and protocol versions
    - Reject connections early based on initialization parameters

    The class is injected via monkey-patching of ``mcp.server.session.ServerSession``
    to intercept session creation within the MCP SDK.

    Note:
        This implementation uses class attributes for middleware injection,
        which means only ONE MCPServer instance is supported per process.
        This is compatible with standard deployment patterns (e.g., uvicorn workers
        run in separate processes), but multiple MCPServer instances in the
        same process will share/override each other's middleware configuration.

    Attributes:
        _middleware_manager: The middleware manager to process initialize requests.
            Injected by MCPServer during initialization.
        _transport_type: The transport type (e.g., "stdio", "streamable-http").
            Injected by MCPServer during initialization.
