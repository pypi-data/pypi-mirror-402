        🎨 GEMINI 3 PRO IMAGE - Professional Image Generation with Advanced Reasoning
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

        Gemini 3 Pro Image (aka "Nano Banana Pro") is Google's state-of-the-art image
        generation model optimized for professional asset production. It uses advanced
        reasoning through "Thinking Mode" to refine composition before generating the
        final high-quality output.

        🌟 KEY CAPABILITIES:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        ✓ High-Resolution Output: Built-in 1K, 2K, and 4K generation
        ✓ Advanced Text Rendering: Legible, stylized text in infographics, menus, logos
        ✓ Reference Images: Up to 14 images (6 objects + 5 humans) for consistency
        ✓ Google Search Grounding: Real-time data (weather, stocks, events, maps)
        ✓ Thinking Mode: Generates interim "thought images" to refine composition
        ✓ Multi-turn Editing: Conversational refinement over multiple turns
        ✓ SynthID Watermarking: All images include invisible SynthID watermark


        📋 PARAMETERS:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

        ► prompt (required, str):
          The text description of your desired image. For best results, use descriptive
          narrative paragraphs rather than keyword lists.

          PROMPTING BEST PRACTICES:
          • "Describe the scene, don't just list keywords" - Use full sentences
          • Be hyper-specific about details (lighting, camera angle, materials, mood)
          • For photorealism: Use photography terms (e.g., "85mm portrait lens",
            "soft bokeh", "golden hour lighting")
          • For text in images: Explicitly state the exact text and font style
          • For logos/branding: Describe style, colors, and placement in detail

          Examples:
          ✓ GOOD: "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist
                   with deep wrinkles, inspecting a tea bowl in his rustic workshop.
                   Soft golden hour light streaming through a window, captured with
                   an 85mm lens creating soft bokeh background."
          ✗ POOR: "old man with pottery"

        ► model (optional, str, default: "gemini-3-pro-image-preview"):
          Model to use. Currently only "gemini-3-pro-image-preview" is supported.
          This is the default and recommended model for all image generation tasks.

        ► enhance_prompt (optional, bool, default: False):
          Automatically enhance your prompt using Gemini Flash for superior results.

          ⚠️ ENHANCEMENT IS OFF BY DEFAULT to preserve user intent.

          WHEN TO ENABLE (set to True):
          • User explicitly requests prompt enhancement
          • Your prompt is too simple/vague (e.g., "a cat" or "sunset")
          • User wants more creative/detailed interpretation

          DO NOT ENABLE FOR:
          • Well-detailed prompts with specific requirements
          • Technical/precise image requests (diagrams, infographics, UI mockups)
          • When user wants exact control over composition

          What it does: Transforms simple prompts into detailed, cinematic descriptions.
          Example: "cat in space helmet" → "A photorealistic portrait of a domestic
          tabby cat wearing a futuristic space helmet, close-up composition, warm
          studio lighting, detailed fur texture, reflective visor..."

          NOTE: Enhancement adds 2-5 seconds latency and uses Gemini Flash.

        ► aspect_ratio (optional, str, default: "1:1"):
          Image proportions. Choose based on your use case.

          OPTIONS: "1:1", "2:3", "3:2", "3:4", "4:3", "4:5", "5:4", "9:16", "16:9", "21:9"

          USAGE GUIDE:
          • "1:1" (Square) - Social media posts, profile pictures, logos
          • "16:9" (Widescreen) - YouTube thumbnails, presentation slides, banners
          • "9:16" (Vertical) - Instagram Stories, mobile wallpapers, TikTok
          • "3:2" or "4:3" - Standard photography, prints
          • "4:5" - Instagram feed posts (portrait)
          • "21:9" (Ultrawide) - Cinematic scenes, panoramic views

        ► image_size (optional, str, default: "2K"):
          Resolution of the generated image. IMPORTANT: Must use uppercase 'K'.

          OPTIONS: "1K", "2K", "4K" (lowercase like "1k" will be REJECTED)

          RESOLUTION GUIDE:
          • "1K" (~1024px) - Fast generation, testing, development iterations
            Token cost: 1120 tokens
            File size: ~1-2MB

          • "2K" (~2048px) - RECOMMENDED for most professional use cases
            Token cost: 1120 tokens
            File size: ~3-5MB
            Best balance of quality and speed

          • "4K" (~4096px) - Maximum quality for production assets, print materials
            Token cost: 2000 tokens (higher cost!)
            File size: ~8-15MB
            Use for: Final deliverables, large format prints, detailed artwork

          PRO TIP: Start with 2K during iteration, then regenerate at 4K for final output.

        ► output_format (optional, str, default: "png"):
          Image file format.

          OPTIONS: "png", "jpeg", "webp"

          • "png" (recommended) - Lossless, supports transparency, best for logos/graphics
          • "jpeg" - Smaller files, good for photos without transparency
          • "webp" - Modern format, good compression

        ► reference_image_paths (optional, list[str]):
          Paths to reference images for style consistency and character preservation.

          LIMITS:
          • Up to 14 total reference images
          • Maximum 6 object images (for high-fidelity inclusion of objects/items)
          • Maximum 5 human images (for character/person consistency)

          USE CASES:
          ✓ Character Consistency: Provide photos of people to maintain their appearance
          ✓ Style Transfer: Reference images to match artistic style or mood
          ✓ Object Inclusion: Include specific products, logos, or items
          ✓ Multi-person Compositions: Generate group photos with consistent faces
          ✓ 360° Character Views: Generate different angles of the same character

          Examples:
          • Group photo: ["person1.jpg", "person2.jpg", "person3.jpg"]
            Prompt: "An office group photo of these people making funny faces"

          • Product mockup: ["product.png", "logo.png"]
            Prompt: "Professional e-commerce photo of this product with the logo"

          • Style reference: ["reference_art.jpg"]
            Prompt: "Create a portrait in the artistic style of this reference image"

        ► enable_google_search (optional, bool, default: False):
          Enable real-time data grounding via Google Search.

          WHEN TO USE:
          ✓ Current events: "Visualize last night's Arsenal game in Champions League"
          ✓ Weather forecasts: "5-day weather forecast for San Francisco as a chart"
          ✓ Stock data: "Create an infographic of today's tech stock performance"
          ✓ Real-time maps: "Show current traffic patterns in downtown Tokyo"
          ✓ Recent news: "Illustrate yesterday's SpaceX launch"

          NOTE: Adds 1-3 seconds latency. Response includes `grounding_metadata` with
          the top 3 web sources used. Image-based search results are excluded.

        ► response_modalities (optional, list[str], default: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]):
          What the model should return.

          OPTIONS:
          • ["TEXT", "IMAGE"] (default) - Get both explanation and image
          • ["IMAGE"] - Image only, no text description
          • ["TEXT"] - Text only (unusual for image generation)

          Most use cases should use the default for best results.


        🧠 THINKING MODE (Automatic):
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        Gemini 3 Pro Image uses advanced reasoning for complex prompts. The model
        generates up to 2 interim "thought images" to test composition and logic
        before producing the final high-quality output. This feature is ENABLED BY
        DEFAULT and cannot be disabled.

        The thinking process is visible in the response under the "thoughts" field.
        You can show users the model's reasoning process if desired.


        🏷️ SYNTHID WATERMARKING:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        ALL generated images include an invisible SynthID watermark for authenticity
        and provenance tracking. This is automatic and does not affect visual quality.


        💡 PRACTICAL USE CASE EXAMPLES:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

        1. PROFESSIONAL LOGO DESIGN:
           prompt: "Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The
                   Daily Grind'. Clean, bold sans-serif font in black on white.
                   Circular design with a coffee bean integrated cleverly."
           aspect_ratio: "1:1"
           image_size: "4K"

        2. REAL-TIME DATA VISUALIZATION:
           prompt: "Visualize the current weather forecast for the next 5 days in
                   San Francisco as a clean, modern weather chart with clothing
                   recommendations for each day"

            "grounding_metadata": {...}  // if Google Search was enabled
          }
        }


        ⚠️ IMPORTANT - AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        After generating an image, you MUST:

        1. Parse the JSON response to extract the file path: result["images"][0]["path"]
        2. Inform the user of the EXACT file path where the image was saved
        3. Open the image in the native OS picture viewer using Bash (DO NOT use Read tool):
           - macOS: `open "/path/to/image.png"`
           - Linux: `xdg-open "/path/to/image.png"`
           - Windows: `start "" "/path/to/image.png"`
        4. If thoughts were generated, show the thinking process to the user
        5. If Google Search was used, mention the grounding sources

        Complete Workflow Example:
        ```
        1. Call generate_image tool with parameters
        2. Parse response JSON to get file_path, thoughts, grounding_metadata
        3. Tell user: "✓ Image saved to: /Users/name/gemini_images/gemini3_20250128_image.png"
        4. If thoughts exist: "The model used thinking mode and generated 2 interim
           compositions before the final image."
        5. Call Bash to open image: `open "/Users/name/gemini_images/gemini3_20250128_image.png"`
        ```

        ❌ DO NOT just say "image generated successfully" without showing the path!
        ❌ DO NOT use the Read tool to display the image - use native OS viewer instead!
        ✓ DO open the image in the native picture viewer (open/xdg-open/start)
        ✓ DO parse and show all relevant metadata to help users understand the generation


        🚀 PERFORMANCE TIPS:
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        • Start with 2K during iteration, use 4K only for final output (saves tokens)
        • Disable prompt enhancement if you have expert-level prompts (saves 2-5s)
        • Use Google Search only when you actually need real-time data (saves 1-3s)
        • Limit reference images to what you actually need (max 14, but fewer is faster)
        • For testing: Use 1K resolution and enhance_prompt=False for fastest results
