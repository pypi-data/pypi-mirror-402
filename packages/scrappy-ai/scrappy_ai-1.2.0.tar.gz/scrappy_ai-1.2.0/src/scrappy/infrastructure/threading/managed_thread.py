    Thread with proper lifecycle management and graceful shutdown.

    Unlike daemon threads which are killed abruptly when the process exits,
    ManagedThread supports graceful shutdown where the worker function can
    check for shutdown requests and clean up properly.

    The worker function receives the ManagedThread instance and should
    periodically check the shutdown_requested property to know when to exit.

    Example:
        def worker(thread: ManagedThread) -> None:
            while not thread.shutdown_requested:
                # Do some work
                time.sleep(0.1)
            # Clean up resources
            print("Worker shutting down cleanly")

        managed = ManagedThread(target=worker, name="MyWorker")
        managed.start()

        # Later, request graceful shutdown
        if managed.stop(timeout=5.0):
            print("Thread stopped cleanly")
        else:
            print("Thread did not stop within timeout")
