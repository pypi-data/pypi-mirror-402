Thread-safe event queue for background-to-main communication.

class ThreadSafeEventQueue:
    """
    Thread-safe event queue for background-to-main communication.

    Events can be submitted from any thread via put(), and are processed
    on the calling thread via process_pending(). This ensures callbacks
    always execute on the main thread when process_pending() is called there.

    Thread Safety:
    - put(): Thread-safe, can be called from any thread
    - get(): Thread-safe, blocks until event available or timeout
    - get_nowait(): Thread-safe, returns immediately
    - register_handler(): Should be called from main thread during setup
    - process_pending(): Should be called from main thread in event loop

    Example:
        queue = ThreadSafeEventQueue()

        # Setup (main thread)
        queue.register_handler("semantic_search", handle_semantic_event)

        # Background thread
        queue.put(BackgroundEvent(
            event_type=EventType.INIT_COMPLETE,
            source="semantic_search",
            data=result
        ))

        # Main thread event loop
        while running:
            queue.process_pending()
            # ... other work ...
