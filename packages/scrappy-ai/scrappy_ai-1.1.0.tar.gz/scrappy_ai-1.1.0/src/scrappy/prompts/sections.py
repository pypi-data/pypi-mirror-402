The codebase has not been indexed yet. You are operating in degraded mode with limited search capabilities.

LIMITATIONS:
- No semantic code search available
- Cannot find functions/classes by description
- File content search is limited to grep/text matching only

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- List directory contents
- Read specific files by path
- Search for exact text/strings using grep
- Navigate the codebase manually

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Start with directory listings to understand structure
2. Read key files (README, main entry points)
3. Use grep for exact string searches
4. Build mental map of codebase through exploration

Ask the user to run indexing if you need semantic search capabilities."""

1. **Plan**: Use `task(command="add", ...)` to break down work.
2. **Execute**: Perform the work (edit files, run tests).
3. **Complete**: Use `task(command="update", status="done", ...)` after success.

### Why?
- Allows recovery from errors.
- Keeps the user informed.

### Example
task(command="add", description="Update auth logic") # Returns ID: 1
# ... user performs file edits ...
task(command="update", task_id=1, status="done")
