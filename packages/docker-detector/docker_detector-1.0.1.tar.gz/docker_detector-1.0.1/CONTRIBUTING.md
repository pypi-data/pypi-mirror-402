# Contributing to docker-detector

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `docker-detector`! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ysskrishna/docker-detector.git
   cd docker-detector
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group dev
   ```

3. **Verify the setup**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure everything works:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_docker_detector.py
```

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Keep functions simple and focused
- Add docstrings to all public functions

### Improving Docker Detection

If you want to improve Docker detection methods:

1. Edit `docker_detector/core.py`
2. Add new detection methods or improve existing ones
3. Ensure the function handles errors gracefully (use try-except where appropriate)
4. Add corresponding test cases in the test files
5. Run the test suite to ensure everything passes

### Writing Tests

- All new features should include tests
- Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory
- Test both positive cases (inside Docker) and negative cases (outside Docker)
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Test caching behavior and `force_refresh` parameter

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write your code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash

   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
   
   Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow the format:
   - `feat: add new feature`
   - `fix: fix bug description`
   - `docs: update documentation`
   - `test: add tests for feature`
   - `refactor: improve code structure`

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
