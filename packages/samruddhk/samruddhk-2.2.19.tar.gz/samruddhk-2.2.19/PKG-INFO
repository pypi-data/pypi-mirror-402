# Samruddh K's Graph Algorithms Library

This Python library provides various graph algorithms, including:

- Topological sorting
- Transitive closure
- Breadth-first search (BFS) for reachable nodes
- Checking connectivity of a graph
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths
- Kruskal's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Installation
