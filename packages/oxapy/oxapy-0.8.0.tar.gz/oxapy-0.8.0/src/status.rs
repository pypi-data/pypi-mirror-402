/// HTTP status codes enumeration.
///
/// This enum contains standard HTTP status codes as defined in RFC 7231 and other RFCs.
/// Status codes are grouped by their first digit:
/// - 1xx: Informational responses
/// - 2xx: Successful responses
/// - 3xx: Redirection messages
/// - 4xx: Client error responses
/// - 5xx: Server error responses
///
/// Example:
/// ```python
/// from oxapy import Status, Response, get
///
/// # Create a not found response
/// response = Response("Not found", status=Status.NOT_FOUND)
///
/// # Check status in a handler
/// @get("/resource/{id}")
/// def get_resource(request, id):
///     resource = find_resource(id)
///     if resource is None:
///         return Status.NOT_FOUND
///     return resource
