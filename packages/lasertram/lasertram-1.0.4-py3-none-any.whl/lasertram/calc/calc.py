    # LaserCalc

    The class `LaserCalc` which is devoted to calculating
    concentrations for laser ablation ICP-MS spot or
    line of spots data following the methodology of
    Longerich et al., (1996) and Kent and Ungerer (2006). It should be used in conjunction
    with the output from `LaserTRAM` class. The basic steps are as follows:

    1. upload SRM data
    2. upload `LaserTRAM` output
    3. set the calibration standard
    4. set the internal standard concentrations for the unknowns
    5. calculate the concentrations and uncertainties of all analyses
