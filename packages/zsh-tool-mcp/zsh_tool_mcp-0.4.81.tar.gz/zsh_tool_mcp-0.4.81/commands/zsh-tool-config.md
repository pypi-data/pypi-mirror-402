# zsh-tool Config

Configure your zsh-tool defaults based on your Claude subscription tier.

## Steps

1. **Ask user for their subscription tier** using AskUserQuestion:
   - Header: "Timeout"
   - Question: "Select your Claude subscription tier for optimal zsh-tool performance:"
   - Options:
     - **Pro/Max (2s)** - Faster feedback loop, more responsive. Recommended for Pro and Max subscribers.
     - **Free (30s)** - Budget-friendly, fewer API round-trips. Works great, just slower feedback.
     - **Custom** - Enter your own yield_after value in seconds.

2. **If Custom selected**, ask for the custom value (1-60 seconds).

3. **Create config directory** if needed: `~/.config/zsh-tool/`

4. **Write config file** to `~/.config/zsh-tool/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   # zsh-tool configuration
   # Generated by /zsh-tool-config
   #
   # yield_after: Seconds before returning control (command continues in background)
   #   Recommended by plan:
   #     Pro/Max: 2   (faster iterations)
   #     Free:    30  (budget-friendly)
   #
   yield_after: <selected_value>
   ```

5. **Confirm to user**: "Configuration saved! zsh-tool will use {X}s yield timeout. Restart Claude Code for changes to take effect."

## Notes

- Config file location: `~/.config/zsh-tool/config.yaml`
- This is a global user setting, not per-project
- Changes require Claude Code restart to take effect
