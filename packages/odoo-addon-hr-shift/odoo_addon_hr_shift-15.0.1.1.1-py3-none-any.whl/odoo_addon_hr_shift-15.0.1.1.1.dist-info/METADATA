Configuration
=============

In order to configure and create shift plannings you'll need to be in
the **Shift Manager** security group.

Creating shifts
---------------

Go to *Shifts > Shifts* and create a new one. Define a name, a color (it
will be used in the shifts assignment cards), a start and end time, a
time zone and week days span.

Create as many as you need to.

Setting employees with variable shifts.
---------------------------------------

Go to *Employees > Employees* and in the tab *Work information* go to
the *Schedule* section. There you can set the **Shift planning**
checkbox if this employee should have a shift generated automatically in
the weekly plannings.

Setting the default work week
-----------------------------

Go to *Settings > Employees* and in the *Work organization* section you
can define the default working week for your company. By default it goes
from Monday to Friday.

Usage
=====

After configuring the application we can start making plannings. To
create a new one:

1. Go to *Shifts > Plannings* and click on *Create*.
2. Set the year and week number for the planning and click *Save*.
3. Now click on *Generate* to pre-create the shifts assignments for your
   employees.

You can start assigning shifts click on the *Shifts* smart button where
you'll go to a kanban view with a card per employee that you can drag
into the corresponding shift. Once you do it, you'll the color of the
week days in the card changes to the color of the shift assigned.

|Drag to assign|

Now if you want to assign a different shift for a specific day of that
week to that employee, you can do so clicking on **Shift details**. In
the detailed kanban view drag the days to their corresponding shifts.

|Changing specific days|

Going back to the general assignment screen you'll see the difference in
the days list colors for the employee's card. Every day is clickable and
it will pop up the shift details for that specific day.

Detecting employees issues
--------------------------

An employee could be on leave for one or serveral days of a planning
week. In that case when an assignment is made for that employee the
overlapping days will be flagged as unavailable and no shift will be
assigned.

We can detect those issues from the general plannings view in *Shift >
Plannings*.

|Mark as reviewed|

To set the issue as reviewed we can click on the checkbox of the
employee's assignment card. It won't be counted on the issues summary
when is checked.

Generate planning from another one
----------------------------------

We can generate plannings from other planning so we can copy the shifts
assigments. To do so you can either click on **Generate planning** from
the general plannings view in *Shifts > Plannings* or click on **Copy to
new planning** from the origin planning form.

In both cases a wizard will open where you can choose to which week will
the new planning correspond to and from which planning we'll be copying
the assignations.

Regenerate shifts.
------------------

We can reset the assignments from the planning form clicking on
*Regenerate shifts*.

My shifts
---------

All the internal users can view their assigned shifts going to *Shifts >
My shifts*.

  planning state when all the shifts are reviewed.
