> **indiayz** is a developer-first AI SDK that unifies modern AI capabilities
> under a single, predictable Python interface.
> **Designed for real systems — not demos.**

---

## 🌍 What is **indiayz**?

**indiayz** is an **official, unified, open-source AI toolkit** created to simplify how developers build and scale AI-powered applications.

Instead of stitching together dozens of unrelated libraries, **indiayz provides one consistent abstraction layer** across modern AI domains — from **LLMs and image generation** to **audio, video, agents, and automation**.

**Philosophy:**

> Powerful AI systems should be **simple to use**, **transparent**, and **future-proof**.

---

## ✨ Why indiayz?

* ✅ **One toolkit, many AI capabilities**
* ✅ Clean abstractions over battle-tested open-source libraries
* ✅ **Offline & local-first friendly** (run models on your own machine)
* ✅ Modular architecture — use only what you need
* ✅ Production-oriented design
* ✅ Built with long-term maintainability in mind

This project is **not a wrapper dump**.
It is a **carefully engineered SDK** focused on clarity, consistency, and extensibility.

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?

* AI engineers building **real production systems**
* Developers tired of glue code between libraries
* Teams that want **local & open AI tooling**
* Researchers who value **clarity over hype**
