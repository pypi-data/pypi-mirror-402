This module adds a badge counter on the bottom-right of the activity clock icon
in the navigation bar, showing the count of future activities.

By default, Odoo only shows overdue + today activities in a badge on the top-right of the clock icon.
This module complements that by showing future activities separately.

Features:

* Blue badge on bottom-right of the activity icon
* Shows count of all future activities
* Does not interfere with the existing top-right badge for overdue/today activities
