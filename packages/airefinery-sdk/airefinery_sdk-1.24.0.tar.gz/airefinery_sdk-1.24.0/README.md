## Get Your API Key from AI Refinery

To start using AI Refinery™, you must first create an account and obtain an API key. Contact us through AI Refinery™ [official website](https://airefinery.accenture.com/contact) to submit your request and start your journey with AI Refinery™ SDK.

## Introduction

AI Refinery™ by Accenture is a Cloud Service for developing and executing AI multi-agent solutions. It is a platform designed to help organizations:

- Adopt and customize large language models (LLMs) to meet specific business needs.

- Integrate generative AI across various enterprise functions using a robust AI stack.

- Foster continuous innovation with minimal human intervention.

- Ensure seamless integration and ongoing advancements in AI capabilities within your projects.

The AI Refinery™ SDK is engineered to facilitate the development of AI solutions by leveraging features supported by AI Refinery such as:

- The Distiller Framework: A framework designed to streamline complex workflows by orchestrating various agents that handle different tasks.
- Inference API: An Api designed to seamlessly connect to any Language Model supported by AI Refinery™.
- Knowledge Extraction: An API that is designed to extract knowledge from various formats of input documents containing text, tables, and figures. 


## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the SDK is available on the [official documentation website](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/).

All the APIs integrated in the AI Refinery™ SDK are detailed in [API page](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/api-reference/).

## Installation

We recommend using a MacOS or a Linux system to install the SDK. For Windows setup, we recommend using **WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)**, a Linux kernel you can access from Windows. For instructions on installing WSL, please visit [this page](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/en/latest/guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2/). Please use **Ubuntu Distro 22.04** or above.

```bash
pip install airefinery-sdk
```

## Examples

### 1. Design your Stock Investment Strategy Advisor

This [example](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/tutorial/flow_superagent/tutorial_flow_superagent/) uses the AI Refinery™ SDK to create and run an AI system that can provide suggestions on investing in stocks. This example demonstrates:

- How to manage AI agents using a "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)" workflow representation.
- Usecases of AI Refinery™ `UtilityAgent` and `SuperAgent`.
- AI Agent parallel processing, allowing all tasks to begin execution as soon as they receive the necessary input information.

### 2. Integrate Your Custom Python Functions with the Tool Use Agent
   
The [**Tool Use Agent**](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/tutorial/tutorial_tool_use/) is a utility agent designed to perform function calls using provided tools. It enables dynamic execution of functions based on user queries, allowing for a flexible and extensible system. By integrating both built-in and custom tools, the agent can process a wide range of tasks—from simple calculations to complex data processing.  

### 3. Integrate Responsible AI (RAI) into your project

The RAI module is a [**Responsible AI**](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/tutorial/tutorial_rai_module/) framework designed to help you define, load, and apply safety or policy rules to user queries via a Large Language Model (LLM). This module automatically applies system base rules for RAI checks and allows users to create and add custom rules for specific needs.


### 4. Process your documents to extract the knowledge for your project

This exmaple introduces [**The Knowledge Extraction API**](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/tutorial/knowledge_extraction/knowledge_extraction/) that allows you to send a document and then extract the knowledge/information contained within the documents. This example demonstrates:

- How to perform knowledge extraction tasks from your PPTX, PDF, DOCX, PPT, and DOC files. 
- The [DocumentProcessingClient](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/api-reference/knowledge_api/knowledge-extraction-index/).
- How to construct a knowledge database for your project.

## Quickstart

 
1. Create your first project

- Create a directory named `sdk-project`.  
- Inside the`sdk-project` directory, create a Python file named `example.py` to place the Python code needed to run the SDK Distiller client.  
- Also, within the `sdk-project` directory, create a YAML file named `example.yaml` to provide your project configuration.  

This gives you the following project structure:

```
sdk-project/  
│  
├── example.py  
├── example.yaml
```

2. Configure your project with a single YAML file

You can start by configuring the orchestrator for this project to have access to
  - A `CustomAgent` with the name `Assistant Agent` that you implement and add to executor_dict `executor_dict`
  - An AIRefienry built-in utility agent named `Search Agent.` that you can call and use as-is 

The settings for each of these utility agents are specified under `utility_agents`. You have the flexibility to expand your project based on your requirements. You can add additional custom agents that you define in the future or integrate built-in agents from our [agent library](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/distiller/agent-library/). 

```yaml
orchestrator:
  # Agent name list that the Orchestrator would route the user's queries to
  agent_list:
    - agent_name: "Assistant Agent"
    - agent_name: "Search Agent"

# List of all utility_agents active in the project
utility_agents:

  # Agent 1 configuration
  - agent_class: CustomAgent
    agent_name: "Assistant Agent"
    agent_description: "The Assistant Agent helps the users in their projects."
    config: {}

  # Agent 2 configuration
  - agent_class: SearchAgent
    agent_name: "Search Agent"

```

3. Create you first AIRefinery client

[`AsyncAIRefinery`](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/api-reference/distiller-index/) API creates a distiller client. This client will interface with the AI Refinery™ service to run your project. Below is a function that sets up the distiller client. Here's what it does:  

- Authenticate using `AIREFINERY_API_KEY` from your os envenvironment variables.
- Defines the `simple_agent` function that will cover the scope of the `Assistant Agent` using AI Refinery™ Inference-as-a-service.  
- Instantiates a `AsyncAIRefinery`.  
- Creates a project named `my_first_project` using the configuration specified in the `example.yaml` file.
- Adds the `simple_agent` to the `executor_dict` under the name `Assistant Agent`.
- Runs the project in `interactive` mode.  

```python
import asyncio
import os

from air import AsyncAIRefinery

API_KEY =str(os.getenv("AIREFINERY_API_KEY"))

async def simple_agent(query: str):

    prompt = "You are an AI assistant that helps users navigate their projects."
    client = AsyncAIRefinery(api_key=API_KEY)

    response = await client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

async def distiller_client_test():
    client = AsyncAIRefinery(api_key=API_KEY)
    project_name = "my_first_project"

    # upload your config file to register a new distiller project
    client.distiller.create_project(config_path="example.yaml", project=project_name) 

    # Define a mapping between your custom agent to Callable.
    # When the custom agent is summoned by the super agent / orchestrator,
    # distiller-sdk will run the custom agent and send its response back to the
    # multi-agent system.
    executor_dict = {
        "Assistant Agent": simple_agent,
    }
    async with client.distiller(
        project=project_name,
        uuid="test_user",
        executor_dict=executor_dict,
    ) as dc:
        responses = await dc.query("Hello")
        async for response in responses:
            print(response["content"])  

if __name__ == "__main__":

    asyncio.run(distiller_client_test())


```


### Execution

To execute `my_first_project`, run the following commands on your terminal:

```cmd
cd sdk-project/
python example.py
```

Running these commands will create your project on the AI Refinery™ server and run your Distiller client.
