"""
This module defines the schema used for handling output from
DeepResearchAgent (DRA) sub-agents.

This module provides Pydantic models and enums that standardize how intermediate
outputs and final results are structured and communicated back to the client.

It defines:
- Core Enums
  - `DeepResearchStep`:
        String mappings for main API (step function) calls to `OutputHandler`
  - `DeepResearchStatus`:
        High-level status types (e.g., pipeline steps, progress, references).
- Payload Models
  - `DeepResearchPipelineStepPayload`:
        Represents a major pipeline stage and its display message.
  - `DeepResearchIRProgressPayload`:
        Tracks progress across iterative research tasks.
  - `DeepResearchResearchQuestionsPayload`:
        Outputs generated research questions from the Research Planner.
  - `DeepResearchThoughtStatusPayload`:
        Provides concise updates on intermediate reasoning (in Iterative Researcher).
  - `DeepResearchReferencePayload`:
        Streams discovered references with associated question IDs (in Iterative Researcher).
  - `DeepResearchSummaryStatisticsPayload`:
        Reports overall runtime statistics and resource usage.
  - `DeepResearchIRQuestionDonePayload`:
        Signals when a single research question completes (success or failure).
