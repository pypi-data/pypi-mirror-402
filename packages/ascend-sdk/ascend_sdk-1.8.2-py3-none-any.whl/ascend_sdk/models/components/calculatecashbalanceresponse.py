    r"""The account's withheld deposits. Deposits are withheld if there is a risk of a return (e.g. ACH deposits). Typically, they are withheld for 5 business days after completing. The amounts are **subtracted** from `open_balance_amount` and `open_liquidity_amount` to calculate `available_cash_to_withdraw_amount` and `available_liquidity_amount`. Since deposits have positive amounts, the calculated values will **decrease**. However, withheld deposits will not be subtracted up to the `withheld_deposit_threshold_amount`."""
