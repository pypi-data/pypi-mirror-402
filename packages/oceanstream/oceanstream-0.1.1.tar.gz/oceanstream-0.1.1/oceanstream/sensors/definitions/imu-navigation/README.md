## Deployment Notes

The integrated navigation system includes GPS receivers and IMUs mounted on both the hull and wing. This dual-IMU configuration provides comprehensive motion and orientation data for the vehicle's hull and articulated wing structure. All navigation data is filtered and averaged to reduce noise.
