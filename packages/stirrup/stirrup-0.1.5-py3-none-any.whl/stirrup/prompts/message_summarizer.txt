The context window is approaching its limit. Please create a concise summary of the conversation so far to preserve important information.

Your summary should include:

1. **Task Overview**: What is the main goal or objective?

2. **Progress Made**: What has been accomplished so far?
   - Key files created/modified (with paths)
   - Important functions/classes implemented
   - Tools used and their outcomes

3. **Current State**: Where are we now?
   - What is currently working?
   - What has been tested/verified?

4. **Next Steps**: What still needs to be done?
   - Outstanding TODOs (with specific file paths and line numbers if applicable)
   - Known issues or bugs to address
   - Features or functionality not yet implemented

5. **Important Context**: Any critical details that shouldn't be lost
   - Special configurations or setup requirements
   - Important variable names, API endpoints, or data structures
   - Edge cases or constraints to keep in mind
   - Dependencies or relationships between components

Keep the summary concise but comprehensive. Do not use any tools. Focus on actionable information that will allow smooth continuation of the work.
