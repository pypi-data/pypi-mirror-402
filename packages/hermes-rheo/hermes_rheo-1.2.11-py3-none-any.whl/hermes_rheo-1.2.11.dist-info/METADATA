# hermes-rheo

[![PyPI Version][pypi-image]][pypi-url] [![pypi download][pypi-download]][pypi-url]

Python package designed to complement and extend the [piblin](https://github.com/3mcloud/piblin) library, 
offering a set of transforms tailored for analysis of rheological data.
Publication of this work is forthcoming. For now, if you use this software, please cite it using the metadata in the 
[citation](https://github.com/3mcloud/hermes-rheo/blob/main/CITATION.cff) file and the above DOI.

## Documentation

Documentation to learn more about the package and how to use its API is availble at: 

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hermes-rheo/badge/?version=latest)](https://hermes-rheo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Installation

`hemres-rheo` is in the PyPI! You can easily install it using `pip`:

```
pip install hermes-rheo
```

and likewise update it:

```
pip install hermes-rheo --upgrade
```

## Usage

### Importing the package

Once the package has been installed, you can simply import its modules:

```python
from hermes_rheo.transforms.rheo_analysis import RheoAnalysis
```

## File readers 

The [file_readers](https://github.com/3mcloud/hermes-rheo/tree/main/src/hermes_rheo/file_readers) directory, 
contains an example file reader for rheological data collected using [TA TRIOS software](https://www.tainstruments.com/trios-software). 
This reader was designed to read .txt files generated via the "Export to LIMS" command in TRIOS. Starting with TRIOS V5,
a new export format, .json, has been introduced. [See new features here](https://www.tainstruments.com/wp-content/uploads/NewFeaturesTRIOS.pdf), 
and a reader for this format is currently in development.

For other formats or instruments, users can develop custom readers while still utilizing the package's data transforms 
for analysis. For assistance in developing a reader for your data format, please contact aperego[at]mmm.com.

## Examples

The [tutorial_notebooks](https://github.com/3mcloud/hermes-rheo/tree/main/tutorial_notebooks) folder
contains multiple examples that showcase the software’s functionality in detail.
