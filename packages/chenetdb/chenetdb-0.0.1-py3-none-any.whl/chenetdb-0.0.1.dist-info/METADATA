# ChenetDB

> **A Pythonic driver for managing graph data topology on top of MongoDB.**

---

## 🚧 Project Status: Pre-Alpha

**ChenetDB is currently under active development.** The API is subject to change. We are building the core driver to allow seamless graph operations (Nodes, Edges, Traversals) using MongoDB as the persistent storage engine.

**Current Stage:** 🏗️ *Architecture & Skeleton Implementation*  **Expected Alpha Release:** *Q3 2026*

---

## 💡 The Vision

MongoDB is an incredible document store, but handling complex relationships often requires rigid schemas or expensive aggregations. **ChenetDB** bridges the gap. 

It provides a strictly typed graph layer that abstracts the complexity of storing networks in a document database.



### Key Features (Planned)
* **3-Collection Architecture:** Automatically manages separate collections for `_nodes`, `_edges`, and `_logs` for every graph.
* **Rich Properties:** Nodes and Edges are fully compliant MongoDB documents (store JSON of any complexity).
* **ACID Graph Operations:** Atomic node/edge creation.
* **Audit Logging:** Built-in history tracking for graph mutations.
* **Pythonic API:** Feels like `NetworkX`, scales like `MongoDB`.

## 🛠️ Installation

*Coming soon to PyPI.*

Currently, you can install the development version via `uv` or `pip` from source:

## Using uv (Recommended for contributors)
```bash
uv sync
```

## Or standard pip
```
pip install git+[https://github.com/Pont-Vision/ChenetDB.git](https://github.com/Pont-Vision/ChenetDB.git)# ChenetDB 
```
