# Documentation

This folder contains the documentation source files for Spec Kitty, built using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

The live CLI always negotiates specs and plans interactively; expect every command to open with a discovery interview before artifacts are written.

Spec Kitty is a community-maintained fork of GitHub's [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), and the documentation keeps references to the upstream project in accordance with the original license.
