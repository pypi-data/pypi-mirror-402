# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to the Spec Kitty CLI and templates are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.13] - 2026-01-10

###  Changed

- **Command template consolidation** - Unified command templates into \.kittify/missions/<mission-key>/command-templates/\ for cleaner directory structure with single source of truth
- **Mission directory structure** - Reorganized mission assets: constitution at \.kittify/missions/<mission-key>/constitution.md\, templates and command-templates in mission subdirectories

###  Fixed

- **Mission-aware template copying** - Template operations now respect project's configured mission via \mission_key\ parameter; migrations read mission from metadata.yaml
- **Dashboard constitution detection** - Fixed feature-level constitution.md artifact tracking for new mission structure
- **UTF-8 encoding in init** - Fixed encoding errors when creating README.md on Windows by explicitly using UTF-8
- **Feature creation command syntax** - Corrected output messages to use proper spec-kitty CLI syntax

## [0.10.12] - 2026-01-07

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Upgrade migration parameter mismatch** (#68 follow-up)
  - Fixed `m_0_10_9_repair_templates.py` migration calling `generate_agent_assets()` with wrong parameter name
  - Changed `ai=ai_config` to `agent_key=ai_config` to match function signature
  - Corrected parameter order to match function definition
  - **Root cause**: Migration was using deprecated parameter name, blocking users from upgrading to 0.10.11
  - **Impact**: Users unable to run `spec-kitty upgrade` to get template fixes from 0.10.11

## [0.10.11] - 2026-01-07

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Deprecated script references in mission templates** (#68)
  - Fixed `.kittify/missions/software-dev/templates/task-prompt-template.md` to use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task` instead of deprecated `python3 .kittify/scripts/tasks/tasks_cli.py`
  - Fixed `.kittify/templates/task-prompt-template.md` with same update
  - Fixed `.kittify/missions/software-dev/command-templates/tasks.md` to reference CLI commands
  - Updated `.kittify/templates/POWERSHELL_SYNTAX.md` to document spec-kitty CLI instead of obsolete PowerShell scripts
  - **Root cause**: Migration 0.10.9 fixed agent command templates but missed mission-specific templates
  - **Impact**: Agents were executing users' local `cli.py` files instead of spec-kitty CLI on Windows

### ✨ Added

- **Template compliance tests** - Prevent deprecated script references
  - `test_no_deprecated_script_references()` - Detects old `.kittify/scripts/` paths in templates
  - `test_templates_use_spec_kitty_cli()` - Ensures templates reference spec-kitty CLI commands
  - Tests run on all mission templates and global templates
  - Prevents regression of issue #68

## [0.10.10] - 2026-01-06

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Windows UTF-8 encoding error in agent commands** (#66)
  - Fixed `'charmap' codec can't encode characters` error on Windows
  - `spec-kitty agent feature create-feature` now works correctly on Windows
  - Added UTF-8 stdout/stderr reconfiguration in main() entry point
  - Handles Unicode characters in git output and error messages
  - Gracefully falls back for Python < 3.7

## [0.10.9] - 2026-01-06

### 🐛 Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Wrong templates bundled in PyPI packages** (#62, #63, #64)
  - Fixed pyproject.toml to bundle .kittify/templates/ instead of outdated /templates/
  - Removed outdated /templates/ directory entirely to prevent confusion
  - All PyPI installations now receive correct Python CLI templates
  - No more bash script references in command templates
  - Migration 0.10.0 now handles missing templates gracefully
  - Added package bundling validation tests to prevent regression

- **Template divergence eliminated**
  - 10 of 13 command templates were outdated in /templates/
  - implement.md was 199 lines longer in old location (277 vs 78 lines)
  - Git hooks were missing (1 vs 3)
  - claudeignore-template was missing

- **All 12 AI agent integrations fixed**
  - Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Windsurf,
    GitHub Codex, Kilocode, Augment Code, Roo Cline, Amazon Q
  - All agents now receive correct Python CLI slash commands

### ✨ Added

- **`spec-kitty repair` command** - Standalone command to repair broken templates
  - Detects bash/PowerShell script references in slash commands
  - Automatically regenerates templates from correct source
  - Provides detailed feedback about repairs performed
  - Can be run with `--dry-run` to preview changes

  - Checks for bash script references before release
  - Tests importlib.resources accessibility

### 📚 Migration & Upgrade Path

**For users with broken installations (issues #62, #63, #64):**

1. **Upgrade spec-kitty package:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade spec-kitty-cli
   spec-kitty --version  # Should show 0.10.9
   ```

2. **Run upgrade to apply repair migration:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   spec-kitty upgrade
   ```
   This will automatically detect and fix broken templates.

3. **Alternative: Use dedicated repair command:**
   ```bash
   spec-kitty repair
   ```
   Provides detailed feedback about what's being fixed.

4. **Verify repair:**
   ```bash
   # Check for bash script references (should return nothing)
   grep -r "scripts/bash" .claude/commands/
   ```

**For new projects:**
- Automatically get correct templates from package
- No action needed

**For existing healthy projects:**
- Run `spec-kitty upgrade` to stay current
- No breaking changes

### 🔒 Breaking Changes

None - Fully backwards compatible. Existing projects will upgrade smoothly.

## [0.10.6] - 2025-12-18

### ✨ Added

- **Workflow commands for simplified agent experience**
  - New `spec-kitty agent workflow implement [WP_ID]` command
  - New `spec-kitty agent workflow review [WP_ID]` command
  - Commands display full WP prompt directly to agents (no file navigation)
  - Auto-detect first planned/for_review WP when no ID provided
  - Auto-move WP to "doing" lane before displaying prompt
  - Show "WHEN YOU'RE DONE" instructions at top of output
  - Display source file path for easy re-reading
  - Prevents race conditions (two agents picking same WP)

### 🔧 Changed

- **Slash command template simplification**
  - implement.md: 78 lines → 11 lines (calls workflow command)
  - review.md: 72 lines → 11 lines (calls workflow command)
  - Templates now just run workflow commands instead of complex instructions
  - Agents see prompts immediately without navigation confusion

- **Consistent lane management**
  - Both implement and review workflows move WP to "doing" at start
  - Prevents ambiguity about which lane means "actively working"
  - Review workflow now supports auto-detect (no argument needed)

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Worktree path resolution**
  - Fixed `_find_first_planned_wp()` to work correctly in worktrees
  - Fixed `_find_first_for_review_wp()` to work correctly in worktrees
  - Auto-detect now finds WPs in worktree's kitty-specs/, not main repo

- **Legacy subdirectory cleanup**
  - Migrated features 007 and 010 from old subdirectory structure to flat structure
  - Moved 15 WP files from `tasks/done/phase-*/` to flat `tasks/`
  - All features now use proper flat structure with frontmatter-only lanes

## [0.9.4] - 2025-12-17

### 📚 Documentation & Validation

- **Prevent agent-created subdirectories in tasks/**
  - Added explicit warnings to tasks/README.md
  - Updated AGENTS.md with flat structure requirements
  - Updated /spec-kitty.tasks template to forbid subdirectories
  - Added runtime validation in check-prerequisites.sh
  - Blocks execution if phase-*, component-*, or any subdirectories found
  - Clear error messages with examples of correct vs wrong paths

This prevents Claude agents from creating organizational subdirectories like `tasks/phase-1/`, `tasks/backend/`, etc.

## [0.9.3] - 2025-12-17

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Critical symlink detection fix**
  - Now checks `is_symlink()` BEFORE `exists()` (exists() returns False for broken symlinks!)
  - Properly removes both working and broken symlinks from worktrees
  - Fixes remaining test failures in worktree cleanup migration
  - Handles all symlink scenarios correctly

This completes the fix for symlink removal in worktree cleanup.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-12-17

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Symlink handling in worktree cleanup**
  - Migration now properly detects and removes symlinks to command directories
  - Uses `unlink()` for symlinks instead of `shutil.rmtree()`
  - Fixes "Cannot call rmtree on a symbolic link" error during upgrade
  - Handles both symlinks and regular directories correctly

This fixes the upgrade failure when worktrees have symlinked agent command directories.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-17

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Improvements

This release fixes critical issues found in v0.9.0 and adds version checking to prevent compatibility problems.

  - Removes ALL agent command directories from worktrees (.codex/prompts/, .gemini/commands/, etc.)
  - Removes .kittify/scripts/ from worktrees (inherit from main repo)
  - Normalizes all frontmatter to consistent YAML format
  - Fixes issue where worktrees had old command templates referencing deprecated scripts

- **Flat structure in new features**
  - Fixed create-new-feature.sh to create flat tasks/ directory (not subdirectories)
  - Updated README.md documentation to reflect v0.9.0+ structure
  - New features now work correctly with frontmatter-only lanes from day one

- **Lane validation**
  - tasks_cli.py update command now validates lane values

  - Clear error messages for invalid input

### 🔧 Changed

- Added `ruamel.yaml>=0.18.0` dependency for consistent YAML handling
- Updated success messages to reflect flat structure

### 🚀 Migration

If you upgraded to v0.9.0 and still have issues, run `spec-kitty upgrade` again to apply v0.9.1 fixes:
- Completes any remaining lane migrations
- Cleans up worktree command directories
- Normalizes all frontmatter for consistency

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-17

### 🎯 Major Release: Frontmatter-Only Lane Management

This release fundamentally changes how Spec Kitty manages work package lanes, eliminating directory-based lane tracking in favor of a simpler, conflict-free frontmatter-only system.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Lane system completely redesigned**
  - Work packages now live in a flat `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/` directory
  - Lane status determined **solely by `lane:` frontmatter field** (no more subdirectories)
  - Old system: `tasks/planned/WP01.md`, `tasks/doing/WP02.md` ❌
  - New system: `tasks/WP01.md` with `lane: "planned"` ✅

- **Command renamed: `move` → `update`**
  - `tasks_cli.py move` command removed
  - Use `tasks_cli.py update <feature> <WP> <lane>` instead
  - Semantic clarity: command updates metadata, doesn't move files
  - Legacy format detection: `update` command refuses to work on old directory-based structure

- **Direct frontmatter editing now supported**
  - You can now directly edit the `lane:` field in WP frontmatter
  - Previous "DO NOT EDIT" warnings removed from all templates
  - System recognizes manual lane changes immediately
  - No file movement required for lane transitions

### 🆕 Added

- **Migration command: `spec-kitty upgrade`**
  - Automatically migrates features from directory-based to frontmatter-only format
  - Preserves all lane assignments during migration
  - Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
  - Cleans up empty lane subdirectories after migration
  - Migrates both main repo and worktree features

- **Legacy format detection**
  - `is_legacy_format()` function detects old directory-based structure
  - CLI commands display helpful warnings when legacy format detected
  - Dashboard shows migration prompt for legacy features
  - Non-blocking: legacy features remain functional until migrated

- **Enhanced status command**
  - Better formatted output with lane grouping
  - Auto-detects feature from branch/worktree when not specified
  - Shows work packages organized by current lane
  - Works with both legacy and new formats

### 🔧 Changed

- **Work package location logic**
  - `locate_work_package()` now searches flat `tasks/` directory first
  - Falls back to legacy subdirectory search for backwards compatibility
  - Exact WP ID matching (WP04 won't match WP04b)

- **Lane extraction utilities**
  - New `get_lane_from_frontmatter()` function extracts lane from YAML
  - Defaults to "planned" when `lane:` field missing
  - Validates lane values against allowed set
  - Available in both `task_helpers.py` and `tasks_support.py`

- **Dashboard scanner updates**
  - Reads lane from frontmatter instead of directory location
  - Displays legacy format warnings
  - Works seamlessly with both formats during transition

- **Activity log behavior**
  - Lane transitions still append activity log entries
  - Captures agent, shell PID, and timestamp
  - No file movement logged (because no movement occurs)

### 📚 Documentation

- **Updated all templates**
  - `.kittify/templates/task-prompt-template.md` - Removed "DO NOT EDIT" warnings
  - `.kittify/templates/tasks-template.md` - Updated for flat structure
  - `.kittify/templates/AGENTS.md` - New lane management instructions
  - `tasks/README.md` - Rewritten for flat directory layout

- **Updated mission templates**
  - All mission-specific templates updated (software-dev, research)
  - Command templates updated (`implement.md`, `review.md`, `merge.md`)
  - Examples updated to show new workflow

- **Updated main documentation**
  - `README.md` - Updated quick start examples
  - `docs/quickstart.md` - New lane management workflow
  - `docs/multi-agent-orchestration.md` - Updated collaboration examples
  - All `examples/` updated with new commands

### 🧪 Testing

- 286 tests passing (0 failures)
- New tests for frontmatter-only lane system
- Legacy format detection tests
- Migration command tests
- Dual-format compatibility tests

### 🚀 Migration Guide

**For existing projects:**

1. **Back up your work** (commit changes, push to remote)
2. **Run migration**: `spec-kitty upgrade`
3. **Verify**: `spec-kitty status --feature <your-feature>`
4. **Update workflows**: Replace `move` with `update` in scripts/docs

**Key benefits of upgrading:**

- ✅ No file conflicts during lane changes (especially in worktrees)
- ✅ Direct editing of `lane:` field supported
- ✅ Better multi-agent compatibility
- ✅ Simpler mental model (one directory, not four)
- ✅ Fewer git operations per lane change

**Legacy format still works** - You can continue using old directory structure until ready to migrate. All commands detect format automatically.

### 🐛 Fixed

- File conflicts during simultaneous lane changes by multiple agents
- Git staging issues with lane transitions
- Race conditions in worktree-based parallel development
- Lane mismatch validation errors (no longer possible with frontmatter-only)

### 🔗 Related

- Feature implementation: `007-frontmatter-only-lane`
- All 6 work packages completed and reviewed
- Comprehensive test coverage added

---

## [0.8.2] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- **Task lane management documentation** - Added clear instructions to AGENTS.md and task templates warning agents never to manually edit the `lane:` YAML field
  - Lane is determined by directory location, not YAML field
  - Editing `lane:` without moving the file creates a mismatch that breaks the system
  - All templates now include YAML comment: `# DO NOT EDIT - use: tasks_cli.py move`
  - Added "Task Lane Management Rule" section to project AGENTS.md

## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- **Work package move race conditions** - Multiple agents can now work on different WPs simultaneously without blocking each other
  - Conflict detection now only blocks on changes to the same WP, not unrelated WP files
  - Agents working on WP05 no longer block moves of WP04

- **Exact WP ID matching** - `WP04` no longer incorrectly matches `WP04b`
  - Changed from prefix matching to exact boundary matching
  - Pattern now requires WP ID to be followed by `-`, `_`, `.`, or end of filename

- **Cleanup no longer leaves staged deletions** - Stale copy cleanup uses filesystem delete instead of `git rm`
  - Prevents orphaned staged deletions from blocking subsequent operations
  - Automatically unstages any previously staged changes to cleaned files

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-15

### Breaking Changes

- **Mission system refactored to per-feature model**
  - Missions are now selected during `/spec-kitty.specify` instead of `spec-kitty init`
  - Each feature stores its mission in `meta.json` (field: `"mission": "software-dev"`)
  - `.kittify/active-mission` symlink/file is no longer used
  - Run `spec-kitty upgrade` to clean up existing projects

- **Removed commands**
  - `spec-kitty mission switch` - Missions are now per-feature, not per-project
  - Running this command now shows a helpful error message explaining the new workflow

- **Removed flags**
  - `--mission` flag from `spec-kitty init` - Use `/spec-kitty.specify` instead
  - Flag is hidden but shows deprecation warning if used

### Added

- **Mission inference during `/spec-kitty.specify`** - LLM analyzes feature description and suggests appropriate mission:
  - "Build a REST API" → suggests `software-dev`
  - "Research best practices" → suggests `research`
  - User confirms or overrides the suggestion
  - Explicit `--mission` flag bypasses inference

- **Per-feature mission storage** - Selected mission stored in feature's `meta.json`:
  - All downstream commands read mission from feature context
  - Legacy features without mission field default to `software-dev`

- **Mission discovery** - New `discover_missions()` function returns all available missions with source indicators

- **Updated `spec-kitty mission list`** - Shows source column (project/built-in) for each mission

- **Migration for v0.8.0** - `spec-kitty upgrade` removes obsolete `.kittify/active-mission` file

- **AGENTS.md worktree fix** - New worktrees get AGENTS.md symlink, and `spec-kitty upgrade` fixes existing worktrees

### Changed

- All downstream commands (`/spec-kitty.plan`, `/spec-kitty.tasks`, `/spec-kitty.implement`, `/spec-kitty.review`, `/spec-kitty.accept`) now read mission from feature's `meta.json`
- `create-new-feature.sh` accepts `--mission <key>` parameter to set mission in meta.json
- Common bash/PowerShell scripts updated to resolve mission from feature directory
- `spec-kitty mission current` shows current default mission (for informational purposes)
- Dashboard template now includes dynamic AGENTS.md path discovery instructions

### Deprecated

- `set_active_mission()` function - Shows deprecation warning, will be removed in future version

### Migration Guide

1. Run `spec-kitty upgrade` to remove `.kittify/active-mission`
2. Existing features without `mission` field will use `software-dev` by default
3. New features will have mission set during `/spec-kitty.specify`

## [0.7.4] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Script Update Migration** – `spec-kitty upgrade` now updates project scripts:
  - Copies latest `create-new-feature.sh` from package to project
  - Fixes worktree feature numbering bug in existing projects
  - Previously, projects kept old scripts from when they were initialized

## [0.7.3] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Feature Numbers with Worktrees** – Script now scans both `kitty-specs/` AND `.worktrees/` for existing feature numbers:
  - Previously only scanned `kitty-specs/` which was empty when using worktrees
  - This caused new features to get `001` even when `001-*` worktree already existed
  - Now correctly finds highest number across both locations

## [0.7.2] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Slash Commands in Worktrees (Corrected)** – Fixed the fix from v0.7.1:
  - v0.7.1 incorrectly removed commands from main repo (broke `/` commands there)
  - v0.7.2 removes commands from **worktrees** instead (they inherit from main repo)
  - Claude Code traverses UP, so worktrees find main repo's `.claude/commands/`
  - Main repo keeps commands, worktrees don't need their own copy

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-14 [YANKED]

### Fixed

- ~~Duplicate Slash Commands in Worktrees~~ – **Incorrect fix, replaced by v0.7.2**

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **`spec-kitty upgrade` Command** – Automatically migrate existing projects to current version:
  - Detects project version via metadata or directory structure heuristics
  - Applies all necessary migrations in order (0.2.0 → 0.6.7)
  - Auto-upgrades worktrees alongside main project
  - Supports `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--json`, `--target`, `--no-worktrees` options
  - Tracks applied migrations in `.kittify/metadata.yaml`
  - Idempotent - safe to run multiple times

- **Migration System** – Five automatic migrations for project structure updates:
  - `0.2.0`: `.specify/` → `.kittify/` directory rename
  - `0.4.8`: Add all 12 agent directories to `.gitignore`
  - `0.5.0`: Install encoding validation git hooks
  - `0.6.5`: `commands/` → `command-templates/` rename
  - `0.6.7`: Ensure software-dev and research missions are present

- **Broken Mission Detection** – `VersionDetector.detect_broken_mission_system()` identifies corrupted mission.yaml files

- **Migration Registry Validation** – Duplicate migration IDs and missing required fields now raise `ValueError`

### Fixed

- **Test Timeout in Dashboard CLI Tests** – Reduced port cleanup from 763 ports to 8 specific test ports
- **Playwright Window Handling** – Tests now open new windows (not tabs) and close properly on exit

## [0.6.7] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **Missing software-dev Mission in PyPI Package** – Fixed build configuration to include all missions:
  - Added explicit sdist include patterns to pyproject.toml
  - The `software-dev` mission was missing from v0.6.5 and v0.6.6 wheel builds
  - Root cause: `force-include` only applied to wheel target, not sdist (wheel was built from sdist)
  - Now both `software-dev` and `research` missions are correctly packaged

## [0.6.6] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **Test Suite Updated for 12 Agent Directories** – All tests now expect 12 agents (added `.github/copilot/`):
  - Updated `test_init_flow.py`, `test_gitignore_management.py`, `test_gitignore_manager_simple.py`
  - Updated `tests/unit/test_gitignore_manager.py` to expect 12 agents
  - Fixed template manager tests to use new `.kittify/` source paths

### Changed

- **Template Source Paths** – Tests now use correct `.kittify/templates/command-templates/` paths

## [0.6.5] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Pre-commit Git Hooks** – Automatic protection against committing agent directories:
  - Blocks commits containing `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, etc.
  - Warns about `.github/copilot/` (nested in `.github/` which is usually committed)
  - Installed automatically during `spec-kitty init`

- **GitHub Copilot Directory Protection** – Added `.github/copilot/` as 12th protected agent directory

- **.claudeignore Generation** – Optimizes Claude Code token usage by excluding templates

### Fixed

- **Worktree Constitution Symlinks** – Feature worktrees now share constitution via symlink
- **Git Hooks Installation Timing** – Hooks now install after `.git/` is created

## [0.6.4] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- **Agent Commands Missing in Worktrees** – Slash commands now work in all feature worktrees for all AI agents:
  - `create-new-feature.sh` now symlinks agent command directories from main repo to worktrees
  - Supports all 12 agent types: Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Qwen, OpenCode, Windsurf, Codex, KiloCode, Auggie, Roo, Amazon Q
  - Fixes `/spec-kitty.research`, `/spec-kitty.plan`, and all other slash commands in worktrees
  - Existing worktrees get symlinks added when reused (backward compatible)
  - Root cause: worktrees are separate working directories that don't share `.claude/commands/` etc.

## [0.6.3] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed

- **Mission Directory Not Copied During Init** – Projects initialized with `spec-kitty init` now correctly receive mission templates:
  - Fixed `copy_specify_base_from_package()` to look at correct path `specify_cli/missions` (matching pyproject.toml)
  - Previously looked at wrong paths: `.kittify/missions` and `template_data/missions`
  - `software-dev` mission was missing from initialized projects, breaking `/spec-kitty.plan` and other commands
  - Root cause: pyproject.toml packages missions to `specify_cli/missions` but code looked elsewhere

## [0.6.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed

- **PowerShell Wrapper Parameter Handling** – Windows lane transitions now work correctly:
  - Fixed `tasks-move-to-lane.ps1` to properly parse named PowerShell parameters
  - Translates Spec Kitty's named params (`-FeatureName`, `-TaskId`, `-TargetLane`) to `tasks_cli.py` positional args
  - Resolves `unrecognized arguments` error that broke `/spec-kitty.review` on Windows
  - Maintains backward compatibility with positional argument usage
  - Fixes #34

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed

- **Untracked Task File Moves** – Task move workflow now handles untracked files:
  - Added `is_file_tracked()` helper to detect if file is in git index
  - Move command automatically stages untracked source files before moving
  - Fixes `/spec-kitty.implement` failures when `/spec-kitty.tasks` doesn't commit
  - Provides clear feedback: `[spec-kitty] Added untracked file: ...`
  - Defensive fix works with both existing untracked files and future workflows

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Constitution Tracking** – Feature-level constitution.md files now tracked and displayed:
  - Added constitution to scanner artifact list
  - Constitution appears in overview with ⚖️ icon
  - Frontend properly detects constitution.exists property

- **Dashboard Modification Detection** – Dashboard now detects file modifications, not just existence:
  - Scanner returns {exists, mtime, size} for each artifact instead of boolean
  - Frontend updated to use .exists property with optional chaining
  - Overview auto-reloads when artifacts change during polling
  - No manual refresh required to see new/modified files

- **Dashboard Project Constitution Endpoint** – Project constitution now loads in dashboard:
  - Added /api/constitution endpoint to serve .kittify/memory/constitution.md
  - Sidebar Constitution link now displays file content instead of "not found"
  - Separate from feature-level constitution tracking

- **Work Package Conflict Detection Too Strict** – Moving WP no longer blocked by unrelated WP changes:
  - Conflict detection now scoped to same work package ID only
  - Moving WP04 no longer fails if WP06/WP08 have uncommitted changes
  - Reduces false positives from ~90% to ~5%
  - Agents don't need --force for unrelated work packages
  - Still catches real conflicts (same WP in multiple lanes)

- **Accept Command Over-Questioning** – Acceptance workflow now auto-detects instead of asking:
  - Feature slug auto-detected from git branch
  - Mode defaults to 'local' (most common)
  - Validation commands searched in git log
  - Only asks user if auto-detection fails
  - Reduces user questions from 3-4 to 0 in typical case

- **Init Command Blocking on Optional Tools** – Project init no longer fails on missing agent tools:
  - Changed from red error + exit(1) to yellow warning + continue
  - Gemini CLI and other tools are optional
  - Users can install tools later without re-init
  - --ignore-agent-tools flag still available but rarely needed

- **Encoding Normalization Incomplete** – Unicode smart quotes now properly normalized to ASCII:
  - Added character mapping for 12 common Unicode characters
  - Smart quotes (U+2018/U+2019) → ASCII apostrophe
  - Em/en dashes → hyphens
  - Ellipsis, bullets, nbsp → ASCII equivalents
  - --normalize-encoding now produces true ASCII output

### Changed

- **Mission Display Simplified** – Reduced verbose mission card to single line:
  - Removed domain label, version number, path display
  - Removed redundant refresh button (auto-updates every second)
  - Changed from card layout to inline text: "Mission: {name}"
  - Cleaner, less cluttered header

### Added

- **Mission System Architecture** – Complete mission-based workflow system (feature 005):
  - Guards module for pre-flight validation
  - Pydantic mission schema validation
  - Mission CLI commands (list, current, switch, info)
  - Research mission templates and citation validators
  - Path convention validation
  - Dashboard mission display
  - Comprehensive integration tests

## [0.5.3] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Orphaned Process Cleanup** – Fixed dashboard startup failures caused by orphaned test processes:
  - Dashboard now detects and cleans up orphaned processes when health check fails due to project path mismatch
  - Added retry logic after successful orphan cleanup
  - Orphan cleanup triggers on health check failure (not just port exhaustion)
  - Eliminates false "Unable to start dashboard" errors when orphaned test dashboards occupy ports

- **Dashboard Subprocess Import Failure** – Fixed ModuleNotFoundError in complex Python environments:
  - Dashboard subprocess now always inserts spec-kitty path at sys.path[0]
  - Fixes import failures when user's PYTHONPATH or .pth files contain spec-kitty path at lower priority
  - Ensures correct spec-kitty installation takes precedence over environment paths
  - Resolves "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'specify_cli.dashboard'" in subprocesses

### Changed

- **Test Suite Cleanup Improvements** – Enhanced dashboard test cleanup to prevent orphaned processes:
  - Module-level cleanup fixture kills all orphaned dashboards before and after test runs
  - Expanded cleanup port range from 9992-9999 to 9237-10000 (covers default and test ranges)
  - Added `kill_all_spec_kitty_dashboards()` helper using pgrep/pkill
  - Two-tier cleanup strategy: module-level (all processes) + function-level (specific ports)

### Added

- **Testing Guidelines for Agents** (`docs/testing-guidelines.md`) – Comprehensive testing best practices:
  - Required cleanup patterns for dashboard tests (pytest fixtures, autouse fixtures)
  - Anti-patterns to avoid (cleanup in test body, shared directories, no exception handling)
  - Impact analysis of orphaned processes on local development and CI/CD
  - Examples of proper test isolation and resource management

### Changed

- **Command Consolidation** – Merged `spec-kitty check` and `spec-kitty diagnostics` into `spec-kitty verify-setup`:
  - Removed redundant `spec-kitty check` and `spec-kitty diagnostics` commands
  - Tool checking now integrated into `verify-setup` with `--check-tools` flag (default: enabled)
  - Diagnostics mode with dashboard health available via `--diagnostics` flag
  - Removed ASCII banner from verify-setup for cleaner output
  - Simplifies CLI interface - single command for all environment verification
  - JSON output includes tool availability when `--check-tools` is enabled

### Removed

- **`spec-kitty check` command** – Functionality moved to `verify-setup --check-tools`
  - Migration: Use `spec-kitty verify-setup` instead of `spec-kitty check`
  - Tool checking enabled by default, disable with `--check-tools=false`
- **`spec-kitty diagnostics` command** – Functionality moved to `verify-setup --diagnostics`
  - Migration: Use `spec-kitty verify-setup --diagnostics` instead of `spec-kitty diagnostics`
  - Shows Rich panel-based output with dashboard health, observations, and issues

## [0.5.2] - 2025-11-14

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Startup Race Condition** – Fixed root cause of dashboard health check timing out prematurely:
  - Increased health check timeout from 10 to 20 seconds with exponential backoff
  - Retry pattern: 10×100ms, 40×250ms, 20×500ms for adaptive performance
  - Removed workaround fallback check that was masking the real issue
  - Eliminated false "Unable to start dashboard" errors on slower systems

### Changed

- **Dashboard Health Check Strategy** – Improved reliability with exponential backoff:
  - Quick initial checks (100ms) for fast systems
  - Gradual slowdown (250ms then 500ms) for slower systems
  - Total timeout increased to ~20 seconds for adequate startup time
  - Cleaner error handling without port-scanning fallback

### Added

- **Symlinked kitty-specs Test Coverage** – New test validates dashboard works with worktree structure:
  - Tests scenario from bug report (symlinked `kitty-specs/` to `.worktrees/`)
  - Ensures dashboard starts correctly with symlinked directories
  - Prevents regression of false error reporting

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- **Task Metadata Validation Guardrail** – Prevents workflow failures when file locations don't match frontmatter:
  - Auto-detects lane mismatches (file in `for_review/` but `lane: "planned"`)
  - CLI command: `spec-kitty validate-tasks --fix`
  - Integrated into `/spec-kitty.review` workflow (auto-runs before review)
  - Adds activity log entries documenting all repairs
  - Validates required fields (work_package_id, lane) and formats
- **Task Metadata Validation Module** (`src/specify_cli/task_metadata_validation.py`) – Core validation:
  - `detect_lane_mismatch()` - Finds directory/frontmatter inconsistencies
  - `repair_lane_mismatch()` - Auto-fixes with audit trail
  - `validate_task_metadata()` - Comprehensive field validation
  - `scan_all_tasks_for_mismatches()` - Feature-wide scanning

### Changed

- **Version Reading** – Now reads dynamically from package metadata instead of hardcoded value:
  - Uses `importlib.metadata.version()` to get actual installed version
  - `spec-kitty --version` always shows correct version
  - No manual updates needed in `__init__.py`
- **Review Workflow** – Added automatic task metadata validation before review:
  - Runs `spec-kitty validate-tasks --fix` automatically
  - Prevents agents getting stuck on lane mismatches
  - Documented in `.claude/commands/spec-kitty.review.md`

### Fixed

- **Dashboard CLI False Error** – CLI no longer reports "Unable to start dashboard" when dashboard actually started successfully. Added fallback verification to check if dashboard is accessible before reporting failure. Handles race condition where health check times out but server is functional.
- **Review Workflow Blocking** – Review command no longer fails when file locations don't match frontmatter metadata. Auto-validation repairs inconsistencies before review.
- **Hardcoded Version** – `spec-kitty --version` now reads from package metadata, always shows correct installed version.

  - **Layer 4**: Pre-commit hook that blocks commits with encoding errors
  - **Layer 5**: Enhanced AGENTS.md with real crash examples and character blacklist
- **Plan Validation Guardrail** – Prevents agents from skipping the planning phase:
  - Detects 11 template markers in plan.md (threshold: 5+ markers = unfilled)
  - Blocks `/spec-kitty.research` command when plan is unfilled
  - Blocks `/spec-kitty.tasks` via check-prerequisites.sh
  - Clear error messages with remediation steps
- **Character Sanitization Module** (`src/specify_cli/text_sanitization.py`) – Core module for encoding fixes:
  - Maps smart quotes (`' ' " "`) → ASCII (`' "`)
  - Maps plus-minus (`±`) → `+/-`, multiplication (`×`) → `x`, degree (`°`) → `degrees`
  - Supports dry-run mode and automatic backup creation
  - Directory-wide sanitization with glob patterns
- **Plan Validation Module** (`src/specify_cli/plan_validation.py`) – Template detection:

## [0.4.13] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: verify-setup ImportError (Issue #28)** – Fixed ImportError in `verify-setup` command caused by incorrect import statement in `verify_enhanced.py`. Changed `from . import detect_feature_slug, AcceptanceError` to `from .acceptance import detect_feature_slug, AcceptanceError`. This was a blocking bug that prevented users from running the diagnostic command.

## [0.4.12] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- **Version Flag** – Added `--version` and `-v` flags to display installed spec-kitty-cli version.
- **Dashboard Health Diagnostics** – Enhanced `spec-kitty diagnostics` to detect dashboard startup failures, test if dashboard can start, and report specific errors. Now catches issues like corrupted files, health check timeouts, and background process failures.

### Changed

- **Diagnostics Output** – Added Dashboard Health panel showing startup test results, PID tracking status, and specific failure reasons.

## [0.4.11] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

- **PowerShell Python Quoting Bug (Issue #26)** – Fixed SyntaxError in PowerShell scripts caused by double-quote conflicts in embedded Python code. Changed all Python strings in `common.ps1` to use single quotes to avoid PowerShell string parsing conflicts.

### Added

- **PowerShell Syntax Guide** – Created comprehensive `templates/POWERSHELL_SYNTAX.md` with bash vs PowerShell syntax comparison table, common mistakes, and debugging tips for AI agents.
- **Conditional PowerShell Reference** – Enhanced `agent-file-template.md` to conditionally include PowerShell syntax reminders only for PowerShell projects, keeping bash contexts clean.

### Changed

- **AI Agent Context** – PowerShell-specific guidance now provided via separate reference document instead of cluttering bash-focused templates.

Fixes #26
Addresses #27

## [0.4.10] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Missing missions directory in PyPI package** – Added `.kittify/missions/` to `pyproject.toml` force-include list. Previous release (0.4.9) was missing this directory, causing "Active mission directory not found" errors for all fresh installations.

## [0.4.9] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- **Diagnostics CLI Command** – New `spec-kitty diagnostics` command with human-readable and JSON output for comprehensive project health checks.
- **Dashboard Process Tracking** – Dashboard now stores process PID in `.dashboard` metadata file for reliable cleanup and monitoring.
- **Feature Collision Detection** – Added explicit warnings when creating features with duplicate names that would overwrite existing work.
- **LLM Context Documentation** – Enhanced all 13 command templates with location pre-flight checks, file discovery sections, and workflow context to prevent agents from getting lost.

### Changed

- **Dashboard Lifecycle** – Enhanced `ensure_dashboard_running()` to automatically clean up orphaned dashboard processes on initialization, preventing port exhaustion.
- **Feature Creation Warnings** – `create-new-feature.sh` now warns when git is disabled or features already exist, with clear JSON indicators for LLM agents.
- **Import Safety** – Fixed `detect_feature_slug` import path in diagnostics module to use correct module location.
- **Worktree Documentation** – Updated WORKTREE_MODEL.md to accurately describe `.kittify/` as a complete copy (not symlink) with disk space implications documented.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Dashboard Process Orphan Leak** – Fixed critical bug where background dashboard processes were orphaned and accumulated until all ports were exhausted. Complete fix includes:
  - PIDs are captured and stored in `.dashboard` file (commit b8c7394)
  - Orphaned processes with .dashboard files are automatically cleaned up on next init
  - HTTP shutdown failures fall back to SIGTERM/SIGKILL with PID tracking
  - Port range cleanup scans for orphaned dashboards without .dashboard files (commit 11340a4)
  - Safe fingerprinting via health check API prevents killing unrelated services
  - Automatic retry with cleanup when port exhaustion detected
  - Failed startup processes are cleaned up (no orphans from Ctrl+C during health check)
  - Multi-project scenarios remain fully isolated (per-project PIDs, safe port sweeps)
  - Handles all orphan types: with metadata, without metadata, deleted temp projects
  - Prevents "Could not find free port" errors after repeated uses

- **Import Path Bug** – Fixed `detect_feature_slug` import in `src/specify_cli/dashboard/diagnostics.py` to import from `specify_cli.acceptance` instead of package root.

- **Worktree Documentation Accuracy** – Corrected WORKTREE_MODEL.md which incorrectly stated `.kittify/` was symlinked; it's actually a complete copy due to git worktree behavior.

### LLM Context Improvements

All command templates enhanced with consistent context patterns:
- **Location Pre-flight Checks**: pwd/git branch verification with expected outputs and correction steps
- **File Discovery**: Lists what files {SCRIPT} provides, output locations, and available context
- **Workflow Context**: Documents before/after commands and feature lifecycle integration

Templates updated:
- merge.md: CRITICAL safety check preventing merges from wrong location
- clarify.md, research.md, analyze.md: HIGH priority core workflow commands
- specify.md, checklist.md: Entry point and utility commands
- constitution.md, dashboard.md: Project-level and monitoring commands

### Testing

- ✅ Dashboard comprehensive test suite (34 tests, 100% coverage)
- ✅ All CLI commands validated
- ✅ Import paths verified
- ✅ Worktree behavior confirmed across test scenarios
- ✅ LLM context patterns applied consistently

### Security

- Dashboard process cleanup prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- Explicit warnings when creating duplicate features prevent silent data overwrite
- Git disabled warnings ensure users know when version control is unavailable

### Backward Compatibility

All changes are fully backward compatible:
- PID storage is optional (old `.dashboard` files still work)
- Feature collision detection is advisory (doesn't block creation)
- LLM context additions don't change command behavior
- Dashboard cleanup is automatic (users don't need to do anything)

## [0.4.12] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Markdown Rendering** – Fixed issue where .md files in Research and Contracts tabs were not rendered, now properly displays formatted markdown content.
- **Dashboard CSV Display** – Fixed CSV files not rendering in dashboard, now displays as formatted tables with proper styling and hover effects.

### Security

- **Agent Directory Protection** – All 12 known AI agent directories are now automatically added to .gitignore during init, preventing accidental commit of API keys, auth tokens, and other sensitive data.
- **Special .github/ Handling** – Added warning for .github/ directory which is used both by GitHub Copilot and GitHub Actions, reminding users to review before committing.

### Removed

- **Legacy Functions** – Removed `handle_codex_security()` and `ensure_gitignore_entries()` functions, replaced by comprehensive GitignoreManager class.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-11-06

### Added

- **Agent Guidance** – Bundled a shared `AGENTS.md` ruleset that is copied into `.kittify/` so every generated command has a canonical place to point agents for path/encoding/git expectations.
- **Encoding Toolkit** – Introduced `scripts/validate_encoding.py` and new documentation to scan/fix Windows-1252 artifacts, plus a non-interactive init guide in `docs/non-interactive-init.md`.
- **Dashboard Assets** – Split the inline dashboard UI into static CSS/JS files and committed them with the release.

### Changed

- **CLI Help & Docs** – Expanded `spec-kitty init`, `research`, `check`, `accept`, and `merge` help text and refreshed README/index links to render correctly on PyPI.
- **Dashboard Runtime** – Hardened the dashboard server/CLI handshake with health checks, token-gated shutdown, and more resilient worktree detection.
- **Mission Handling** – Improved mission activation to fall back gracefully when symlinks are unavailable (e.g., Windows w/out dev mode) and aligned shell helpers with the new logic.

### Security

- **Codex Guardrails** – Automatically append `.codex/` to `.gitignore`, warn if `auth.json` is tracked, and reiterate the `CODEX_HOME` workflow to keep API credentials out of source control.

## [0.4.6] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed

- **PyYAML Dependency** – Added `pyyaml` to the core dependency list so mission loading works in clean environments (CI no longer fails installing the package).
- **PyPI README Links** – Restored absolute documentation links to keep images and references working on PyPI.

## [0.4.4] - 2025-11-06

### Security

- **Credential Cleanup** – Removed the committed `.codex` directory (OpenAI credentials) from the entire Git history and regenerated sanitized release assets.
- **Token Rotation** – Documented that all compromised keys were revoked and environments refreshed before reissuing packages.

### Changed

- **Release Artifacts** – Rebuilt GitHub release bundles and PyPI distributions from the cleaned history to ensure no secrets are present in published archives.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Automated PyPI Release Pipeline** – Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds, validates, and publishes releases to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret, eliminating manual publish steps.
- **Release Validation Tooling** – `scripts/release/validate_release.py` CLI enforces semantic version progression, changelog completeness, and version/tag alignment in both branch and tag modes with actionable error messages.
- **Release Readiness Guardrails** – Pull request workflow validates version bumps, changelog entries, and test passage before merge; nightly scheduled checks monitor drift.
- **Comprehensive Release Documentation** – Complete maintainer guides covering secret management, branch protection, troubleshooting, and step-by-step release workflows.
- **Changelog Extraction** – `scripts/release/extract_changelog.py` automatically extracts version-specific release notes for GitHub Releases.
- **Release Test Suite** – 4 pytest tests validate branch mode, tag mode, changelog parsing, and version regression detection.

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions Workflows** – Updated `release.yml` with pinned dependency versions, proper workflow ordering (PyPI publish before GitHub Release), and checksums stored in `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- **Workflow Reliability** – Fixed heredoc syntax error in `protect-main.yml` that was causing exit code 127 failures.

### Security

- **Secret Hygiene** – PyPI credentials exclusively stored in GitHub Actions secrets with rotation guidance; no tokens in repository or logs; workflows sanitize outputs.
- **Workflow Permissions** – Explicit least-privilege permissions in all workflows (contents:write, id-token:write for releases; contents:read for guards).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-11-03

### Changed

- **Worktree-Aware Merge Flow** – `/spec-kitty merge` now detects when it is invoked from a Git worktree, runs the actual merge steps from the primary repository checkout, and surfaces clearer guidance when the target checkout is dirty.

### Documentation

- **Merge Workflow Guidance** – Updated templates and Claude workflow docs to describe the primary-repo hand-off during merges and reinforce the feature-worktree best practice.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- **pip Installation Instructions** – All documentation now includes pip installation commands alongside uv, making Spec Kitty accessible to users who prefer traditional Python package management.
- **Multiple Installation Methods** – Documented three installation paths: PyPI (stable), GitHub (development), and one-time usage (pipx/uvx).

### Changed

- **Documentation Consistency** – Updated README.md, docs/index.md, docs/installation.md, and docs/quickstart.md to provide both pip and uv commands throughout.
- **Installation Recommendations** – PyPI installation now marked as recommended for stable releases, with GitHub source for development versions.

### Fixed

- **Packaging Issues** – Removed duplicate `.kittify` force-include that caused "Duplicate filename in local headers" errors on PyPI.
- **Test Dependencies** – Added `pip install -e .[test]` to workflows to ensure all project dependencies available for tests.

## [0.2.20] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- **Automated PyPI Release Pipeline** – Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds, validates, and publishes releases to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret, eliminating manual publish steps.
- **Release Validation Tooling** – `scripts/release/validate_release.py` CLI enforces semantic version progression, changelog completeness, and version/tag alignment in both branch and tag modes with actionable error messages.
- **Release Readiness Guardrails** – Pull request workflow validates version bumps, changelog entries, and test passage before merge; protect-main workflow blocks direct pushes to main branch.
- **Comprehensive Release Documentation** – Complete maintainer guides covering secret management, branch protection, troubleshooting, and step-by-step release workflows in README, docs, and inline help.
- **Enhanced PyPI Metadata** – Added project URLs (repository, issues, docs, changelog), keywords, classifiers, and license information to improve PyPI discoverability and presentation.
- **Changelog Extraction** – `scripts/release/extract_changelog.py` automatically extracts version-specific release notes for GitHub Releases.
- **Release Test Suite** – 4 pytest tests validate branch mode, tag mode, changelog parsing, and version regression detection.

### Changed

- **Documentation Structure** – Added dedicated releases section to docs with readiness checklist, workflow references, and troubleshooting guides; updated table of contents.

### Security

- **Secret Hygiene** – PyPI credentials exclusively stored in GitHub Actions secrets with rotation guidance; no tokens in repository or logs; workflows sanitize outputs.
- **Workflow Permissions** – Explicit least-privilege permissions in all workflows (contents:write, id-token:write for releases; contents:read for guards).

## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Mission system assets** – Bundled Software Dev Kitty and Deep Research Kitty mission definitions (commands, templates, constitutions) directly in the CLI package so `spec-kitty init` can hydrate missions without a network call.

### Changed

- Synced mission templates between the repository and packaged wheel to keep `/spec-kitty.*` commands consistent across `--ai` choices.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Phase 0 Research command** – `spec-kitty research` (and `/spec-kitty.research`) scaffolds `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and CSV evidence logs using mission-aware templates so Deep Research Kitty teams can execute discovery workflows without leaving the guided process.
- **Mission templates for research** – Deep Research Kitty now ships reusable templates for research decisions, data models, and evidence capture packaged inside the Python wheel.

### Changed

- Updated `spec-kitty init` guidance, plan command instructions, and README workflow to include the new research phase between planning and task generation.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Mission picker in init** - `spec-kitty init` now prompts for a mission (or accepts `--mission`) so projects start with Software Dev Kitty, Deep Research Kitty, or another bundled mission and record the choice in `.kittify/active-mission`.

### Changed

- Highlight the active mission in the post-init guidance while keeping the Codex export step as the final instruction.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- **New `/spec-kitty.merge` command** - Completes the workflow by merging features into main branch and cleaning up worktrees automatically. Supports multiple merge strategies (merge, squash, rebase), optional push to origin, and configurable cleanup of worktrees and branches.
- **Worktree Strategy documentation** - Added comprehensive guide to the opinionated worktree approach for parallel feature development.
- **Dashboard screenshots** - Added dashboard-kanban.png and dashboard-overview.png showcasing the real-time kanban board.
- **Real-Time Dashboard section** - Added prominent dashboard documentation "above the fold" in README with screenshots and feature highlights.
- **Mission management CLI** - `spec-kitty mission list|current|switch|info` for inspecting and activating domain-specific missions inside a project.
- **Deep Research Kitty mission** - Research-focused templates (spec, plan, tasks, findings, prompts) and command guardrails for evidence-driven work.
- **Mission packaging** - Missions are now bundled in release archives and Python wheels so project initialization copies `.kittify/missions` automatically.

### Changed

- Updated command list in init output to show workflow order and include merge command.
- Updated `/spec-kitty.accept` description to clarify it verifies (not merges) features.
- Reordered slash commands documentation to reflect actual execution workflow.
- Updated maintainers to reflect fork ownership (Robert Douglass).
- Updated all repository references from `spec-kitty/spec-kitty` to `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty`.
- Updated installation instructions to use GitHub repository URL instead of local directory.

### Fixed

- Removed invalid `multiple=True` parameter from `typer.Option()` in accept command that caused TypeError on CLI startup.
- Fixed "nine articles" claim in spec-driven.md to "core articles" (only 6 are documented).

### Removed

- Removed SECURITY.md (GitHub-specific security policies).
- Removed CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (GitHub-specific contact information).
- Removed video overview section from README (outdated content).
- Removed plant emoji (🌱) branding from all documentation and code.
- Replaced logo_small.webp and logo_large.webp with actual spec-kitty cat logo.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed

- Removed invalid `multiple=True` parameter from `typer.Option()` in accept command that caused TypeError on CLI startup.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-28

### Changed

- Rebranded the CLI command prefix from `speckitty` to `spec-kitty`, including package metadata and documentation references.
- Migrated template directories from `.specify` to `.kittify` and feature storage from `/specs` to `/kitty-specs` to avoid namespace conflicts with Spec Kit.
- Updated environment variables, helper scripts, and dashboards to align with the new `.kittify` and `kitty-specs` conventions.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- New `/spec-kitty.accept` command (and `spec-kitty accept`) for feature-level acceptance: validates kanban state, frontmatter metadata, and artifacts; records acceptance metadata in `meta.json`; prints merge/cleanup instructions; and supports PR or local workflows across every agent.
- Acceptance helper scripts (`accept-feature.sh` / `.ps1`) and expanded `tasks_cli` utilities (`status`, `verify`, `accept`) for automation and integration with AI agents.
- Worktree-aware bootstrap workflow now defaults to creating per-feature worktrees, enabling parallel feature development with isolated sandboxes.
- Implementation prompts now require operating inside the feature’s worktree and rely on the lane helper scripts for moves/metadata, eliminating `git mv` conflicts; the dashboard also surfaces active/expected worktree paths.

### Changed

- `/spec-kitty.specify`, `/spec-kitty.plan`, and `/spec-kitty.clarify` now run fully conversational interviews—asking one question at a time, tracking internal coverage without rendering markdown tables, and only proceeding once summaries are confirmed—while continuing to resolve helper scripts via the `.kittify/scripts/...` paths.
- Added proportionality guidance so discovery, planning, and clarification depth scales with feature complexity (e.g., lightweight tic-tac-toe flows vs. an operating system build).
- `/spec-kitty.tasks` now produces both `tasks.md` and the kanban prompt files in one pass; the separate `/spec-kitty.task-prompts` command has been removed.
- Tasks are grouped into at most ten work packages with bundled prompts, reducing file churn and making prompt generation LLM-friendly.
- Both shell and PowerShell feature bootstrap scripts now stop with guidance to return `WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY_INPUT` when invoked without a confirmed feature description, aligning with the new discovery workflow.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- `/spec-kitty.specify` and `/spec-kitty.plan` now enforce mandatory discovery interviews, pausing until you answer their question sets before any files are written.
- `/spec-kitty.implement` now enforces the kanban workflow (planned → doing → for_review) with blocking validation, new helper scripts, and a task workflow quick reference.
- Removed the legacy `specify` entrypoint; the CLI is now invoked exclusively via `spec-kitty`.
- Updated installation instructions and scripts to use the new `spec-kitty-cli` package name and command.
- Simplified local template overrides to use the `SPEC_KITTY_TEMPLATE_ROOT` environment variable only.

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- Renamed the primary CLI entrypoint to `spec-kitty` and temporarily exposed a legacy `specify` alias for backwards compatibility.
- Refreshed documentation, scripts, and examples to use the `spec-kitty` command by default.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- Rebranded the project as Spec Kitty, updating CLI defaults, docs, and scripts while acknowledging the original GitHub Spec Kit lineage.
- Renamed all slash-command prefixes and generated artifact names from `/speckit.*` to `/spec-kitty.*` to match the new branding.

### Added

- Refreshed CLI banner text and tagline to reflect spec-kitty branding.

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `spec-kitty init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/spec-kitty.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kitty-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.
- Allow `spec-kitty init` to bootstrap multiple AI assistants in one run (interactive multi-select or comma-separated `--ai` value).
- When running from a local checkout, `spec-kitty init` now copies templates directly instead of downloading release archives, so new commands are immediately available.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `spec-kitty.` (e.g., `spec-kitty.specify.md`, `spec-kitty.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers
