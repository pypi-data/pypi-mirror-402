This module allows you to declare your Odoo projects with the list of
installed modules.

Based on the data collected by ``odoo_repository`` module, it will:

- give some code stats (lines of code, and how they are spread among
  Odoo/OCA/your organization)
- give the list of modules available for upgrade in current Odoo version
  (based on module versions)
- list modules still hosted in a pending Pull Request (so not yet
  merged, could be considered as technical debt)
- list modules available in your project repository (if any) but not
  installed in your database (dead code)
