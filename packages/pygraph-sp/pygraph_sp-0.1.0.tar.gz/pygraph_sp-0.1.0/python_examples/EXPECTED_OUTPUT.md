=== Executing Graph ===
Note: Branches A, B, and C will execute in parallel after the source completes.

[source] Generating data...
[branch_a] Starting slow operation...
[branch_a] Completed in 0.500s
[branch_b] Starting fast operation...
[branch_b] Completed in 0.100s
[branch_c] Starting medium operation...
[branch_c] Completed in 0.300s
[merger] Merging results...
[merger] Completed in 0.000s

✓ Execution completed!

=== Results ===
Source value: 100
Branch A result (×2): 200
Branch B result (+50): 150
Branch C result (÷2): 50
Final merged result: 400

=== Performance Analysis ===
Total execution time: 0.900s

Expected times:
  - Sequential execution: ~0.9s (0.5 + 0.1 + 0.3)
  - Parallel execution: ~0.5s (max of branch times)

Note: Current implementation executes sequentially following topological order.
The architecture supports parallel execution - branches are independent!

## Comparison: Rust vs Python Output

The Python examples produce **identical output** to their Rust counterparts, demonstrating:

1. **API Parity**: Python API mirrors Rust API exactly
2. **Type Conversion**: Automatic conversion between Python and Rust types (int ↔ Int, float ↔ Float, dict ↔ Map, list ↔ List)
3. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Same visual representation in both languages
4. **Execution Results**: Same computational results confirming correct data flow
5. **Graph Analysis**: Identical graph structure analysis (depth, width, sources, sinks)

### Key Differences:
- **Syntax**: Python uses `graph_sp.Graph()` vs Rust's `Graph::new()`
- **Function Definition**: Python uses simple functions vs Rust's `Arc<Fn>`
- **Execution**: Python uses `await executor.execute(graph)` vs Rust's async pattern
- **Type System**: Python is dynamically typed, Rust is statically typed

### Verification:
To verify Python bindings work correctly, build and run:

```bash
cargo build --release --features python
python python_examples/simple_pipeline.py
```

The output should match the examples shown above.
