# Holidays in China

## Background

We classify calendar days into:

- regular workdays: working days not on weekends
- regular weekends: weekends (Saturday and Sunday) not working
- festivals: true or legal holidays. e.g. 2026-01-01 (Thursday) is New Year holiday; 2023-01-02 (Monday), which is shifted from 2023-01-01 (Sunday), is also a legal holiday
- quasi-holidays: extra holidays swapped with weekend workdays
- weekend workdays：workdays in weekends for swapped extra holidays

For example, 2025-12-31 (Wednesday) is a regular workday.

2025-01-01 (Thursday) is a festival holiday (New Year)

2025-01-02 (Friday) is a quasi-holiday, though we need not to work on this day, but we need to work on 2026-01-04 (Sunday) to swap with this extra holiday.

2025-01-03 (Saturday) is a regular weekend.

2025-01-04 (Sunday) is a weekend workday. Though it a weekend, but we to work on this day to swap with extra extra holiday on 2025-01-02.

On weekend workdays, exchanges in China mainland are closed, although they are workdays.

In November each year, the state council of China announces the holiday arrangement for next year. Please update the holiday data accordingly.
