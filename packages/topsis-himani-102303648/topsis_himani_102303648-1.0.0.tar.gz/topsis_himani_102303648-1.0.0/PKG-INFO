# TOPSIS Python Package

This project is a Python implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method.

TOPSIS is a decision-making technique used to rank multiple alternatives based on different criteria.
The alternative closest to the ideal solution and farthest from the worst solution gets the highest rank.

This package is developed as part of an academic assignment and can be used directly from the command line.
