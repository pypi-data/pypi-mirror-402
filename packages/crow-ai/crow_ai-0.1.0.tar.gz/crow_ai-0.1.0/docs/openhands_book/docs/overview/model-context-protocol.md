# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> Model Context Protocol support across OpenHands platforms

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows OpenHands to communicate with external tool servers, extending the agent's capabilities with custom tools, specialized data processing, external API access, and more. MCP is based on the open standard defined at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## How MCP Works

When OpenHands starts, it:

1. Reads the MCP configuration
2. Connects to configured servers (SSE, SHTTP, or stdio)
3. Registers tools provided by these servers with the agent
4. Routes tool calls to appropriate MCP servers during execution
