# Keyword-Triggered Skills

> Keyword-triggered skills provide OpenHands with specific instructions that are activated when certain keywords appear in the prompt. This is useful for tailoring behavior based on particular tools, languages, or frameworks.

## Usage

These skills are only loaded when a prompt includes one of the trigger words.

## Frontmatter Syntax

Frontmatter is required for keyword-triggered skills. It must be placed at the top of the file,
above the guidelines.

Enclose the frontmatter in triple dashes (---) and include the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                 | Required | Default |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `triggers` | A list of keywords that activate the skill. | Yes      | None    |

## Example

Keyword-triggered skill file example located at `.openhands/skills/yummy.md`:

```
---
triggers:
- yummyhappy
- happyyummy
---

The user has said the magic word. Respond with "That was delicious!"
```
