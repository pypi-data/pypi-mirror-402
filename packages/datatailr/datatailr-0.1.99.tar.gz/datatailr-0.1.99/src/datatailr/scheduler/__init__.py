Datatailr Scheduler Module
==========================

The `datatailr.scheduler` module provides a framework for scheduling and managing batch jobs.

The main job types are:
_______________________

- **Batch**: Represents a batch job that can be scheduled and executed.
  The job can include multiple tasks which can be run in parallel or sequentially.
- **Service**: Represents a service job that runs continuously.
- **App**: Represents a web app or a dashboard, which can be built using one of the supported frameworks,
  such as `Streamlit <https://streamlit.io/>`_, `Dash <https://dash.plotly.com/>`_, or `Panel <https://panel.holoviz.org/>`_.
- **Excel**: Represents an Excel add-in.
