# Examples

Real PROMPT.md files you can copy and adapt for your own tasks.

## Why Examples?

Seeing working examples is often faster than reading documentation. Each example shows:
- A complete PROMPT.md file
- Why it works (annotations)
- What Ralph will do with it

## Available Examples

**[Adding a Feature](./add-feature.md)**
Build a contact form with validation and email sending.

**[Fixing a Bug](./fix-bug.md)**
Debug and fix a specific issue with clear reproduction steps.

**[Refactoring Code](./refactor.md)**
Restructure code while keeping functionality intact.

## Using These Examples

1. Pick the example closest to your task
2. Copy the PROMPT.md structure
3. Adapt the goal and criteria for your needs
4. Run Ralph:

```bash
ralph run
```

## Tips from the Examples

**Be specific:** "Add login with email/password" not "add authentication"

**Testable criteria:** "Returns 200 status" not "works correctly"

**One focus:** Each example does one thing well

**Include context:** What the agent needs to know about your project
