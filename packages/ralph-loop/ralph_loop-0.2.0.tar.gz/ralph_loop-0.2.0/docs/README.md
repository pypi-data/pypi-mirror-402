# Ralph Documentation

Ralph supervises your AI coding agent to actually finish what it starts.

## Quick Navigation

**Just getting started?**
[Get up and running in 5 minutes](./getting-started.md)

**Something went wrong?**
[Troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting/index.md)

**Need examples?**

**Using Ralph with an AI agent?**
Run `ralph --about` to get a comprehensive explanation the agent can read.

## In a Hurry?

```bash
pipx install ralph-loop
ralph init
# Edit PROMPT.md with your goal
ralph run
```

That's it. Ralph will keep your AI agent working until your goal is complete, verified 3 times.

## What is Ralph?

When you give an AI coding agent a complex task, it can lose context, forget decisions, or declare "done" too early. Ralph fixes this by breaking work into fresh-context chunks and maintaining state between them.

Ralph is for anyone who:
- Uses AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, etc.) to build projects
- Gets frustrated when agents lose track of what they're doing
- Wants reliable completion without constant supervision

Ralph supports multiple AI agents and automatically rotates between them when one becomes exhausted (rate limited). See [Agents](./concepts/agents.md) for details.
