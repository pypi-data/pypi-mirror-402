class ResonatorSpectroscopyByBias(Experiment):
    """
    Parameters for running a resonator spectroscopy by bias experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    resonator : str
        The reference for the resonator to target.
    bias_transmons : list[str] or None, optional
        The references for the transmons to bias.
        Defaults to transmon coupled to the resonator.
    frequencies : list[int] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable \
                  or HypIterable or None, optional
        The frequencies at which to scan, in Hz.
        Defaults to a scan around the readout frequency.
    biases : list[float] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable \
             or HypIterable, optional
        The biases at which to scan, in volts.
        Defaults to 21 points between -0.49 and 0.49.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 1,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 100.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
