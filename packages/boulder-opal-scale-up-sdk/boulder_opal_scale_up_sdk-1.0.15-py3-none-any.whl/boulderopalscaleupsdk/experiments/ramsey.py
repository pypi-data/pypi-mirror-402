class Ramsey(Experiment):
    """
    Parameters for running a Ramsey experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    min_delay_ns : int
        The minimum delay time, in nanoseconds.
    max_delay_ns : int
        The maximum delay time, in nanoseconds.
    delay_step_ns : int
        The step for generating the list of delays, in nanoseconds.
    virtual_detuning : float
        The virtual detuning added between SX pulses, in Hz.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 200,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 400.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    classifier: LinearIQClassifier or "classifier" or "no-classifier", optional
        The classifier to use for classification.
        If "classifier" is passed, the stored classifier will be used, if it's calibrated.
        If "no-classifier" is passed, no classifier will be used.
        Defaults to no classifier being used.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
