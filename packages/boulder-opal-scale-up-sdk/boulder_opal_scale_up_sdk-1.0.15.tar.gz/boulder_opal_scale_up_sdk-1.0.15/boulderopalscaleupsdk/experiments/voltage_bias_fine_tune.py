class VoltageBiasFineTune(Experiment):
    """
    Parameters for running voltage bias fine-tune experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to XY drive.
    delays_ns : list[int] or RangeIterable
        The delay times, in nanoseconds.
    flux_count : int
        Number of flux bias points to sample around the current bias offset.
    flux_delta : float
        Flux difference between flux points, in units of the voltage period.
    virtual_detuning : float
        The difference between the drive signal frequency and the qubit frequency, in Hz.
    bias_transmon : str or None, optional
        The reference for the transmon to flux tune.
        Defaults to transmon.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds.
        Defaults to 100,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take.
        Defaults to 400.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
