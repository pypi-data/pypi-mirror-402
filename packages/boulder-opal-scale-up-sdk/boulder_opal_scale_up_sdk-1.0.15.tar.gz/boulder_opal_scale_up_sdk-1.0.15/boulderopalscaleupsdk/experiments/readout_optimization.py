    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    frequencies : list[int] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable or HypIterable
        The readout frequencies to sweep, in Hz.
    amplitudes : list[float]
        The readout amplitudes to sweep.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 200,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 5,000.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
