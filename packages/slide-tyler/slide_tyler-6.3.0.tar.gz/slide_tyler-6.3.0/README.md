## Overview

### Core Components

### Agent

The central component that:
- Manages conversations through threads
- Processes messages using LLMs (GPT-4.1 by default)
- Executes tools when needed
- Maintains conversation state
- Supports streaming responses
- Handles file attachments and processing
- Integrates with Weave for monitoring

### Thread

Manages conversations and maintains:
- Message history with proper sequencing
- System prompts
- Conversation metadata and analytics
- Source tracking (e.g., Slack, web)
- Token usage statistics
- Performance metrics

### Message

Basic units of conversation containing:
- Content (text or multimodal)
- Role (user, assistant, system, tool)
- Sequence number for ordering
- Attachments (files with automatic processing)
- Metrics (token usage, timing, model info)
- Source information
- Custom attributes

### Attachment

Handles files in conversations:
- Support for binary and base64 encoded content
- Automatic storage management
- Content processing and extraction

- File Storage:
  - Local filesystem with sharded organization
  - Automatic content processing and extraction
  - Configurable size limits and validation

## User Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- uv (modern Python package manager) - recommended
- System dependencies for PDF and image processing

### Installation

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install required libraries for PDF image processing
# macOS:
brew install poppler

# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

# Using uv (recommended)
uv add slide-tyler

# Using pip (fallback)
pip install slide-tyler
```

# For development installation:
```bash
uv add slide-tyler --dev
```

When you install Tyler, all required runtime dependencies will be installed automatically, including:
- LLM support (LiteLLM, OpenAI)
- Storage components (Narrator)
- Tools package (Lye)
- Monitoring and metrics (Weave, Wandb)
- File processing (PDF, images)
- All core utilities

### Basic Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with the following configuration:
```bash
# Database Configuration (used by Narrator)
# For local development with Docker: cd packages/narrator && docker-compose up -d
# Then use: NARRATOR_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://narrator:narrator_dev@localhost:5432/narrator
NARRATOR_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/dbname
# Or for SQLite:
# NARRATOR_DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///path/to/database.db

# Optional Database Settings
NARRATOR_DB_ECHO=false
NARRATOR_DB_POOL_SIZE=5
NARRATOR_DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=10
NARRATOR_DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=30
NARRATOR_DB_POOL_RECYCLE=300

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Logging Configuration
WANDB_API_KEY=your-wandb-api-key

# Optional Integrations (for Lye tools)
NOTION_TOKEN=your-notion-token
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-slack-bot-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret

# File storage configuration
NARRATOR_FILE_STORAGE_PATH=/path/to/files  # Optional, defaults to ~/.narrator/files
NARRATOR_MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB default
NARRATOR_MAX_STORAGE_SIZE=5368709120  # 5GB default

# Other settings
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

Only the `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or whatever LLM provider you're using) is required for core functionality. Other environment variables are required only when using specific features:
- For Weave monitoring: `WANDB_API_KEY` is required (You will want to use this for monitoring and debugging) [https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/](Weave Docs)
- For Slack integration: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is required  
- For Notion integration: `NOTION_TOKEN` is required
- For database storage:
  - By default uses in-memory storage (perfect for scripts and testing)
  - For PostgreSQL or SQLite: Set `NARRATOR_DATABASE_URL` with appropriate connection string
- For file storage: Defaults will be used if not specified

For more details about each setting, see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

### LLM Provider Support

Tyler uses LiteLLM under the hood, which means you can use any of the 100+ supported LLM providers by simply configuring the appropriate environment variables. Some popular options include:

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key
AZURE_API_BASE=your-azure-endpoint
AZURE_API_VERSION=2023-07-01-preview

# Google VertexAI
VERTEX_PROJECT=your-project-id
VERTEX_LOCATION=your-location

# AWS Bedrock
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION_NAME=your-region
```

When initializing an Agent, you can specify any supported model using the standard model identifier:

```python
# OpenAI
agent = Agent(model_name="gpt-4")

# Anthropic
agent = Agent(model_name="claude-2")

# Azure OpenAI
agent = Agent(model_name="azure/your-deployment-name")

# Google VertexAI
agent = Agent(model_name="chat-bison")

# AWS Bedrock
agent = Agent(model_name="anthropic.claude-v2")
```

For a complete list of supported providers and models, see the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

### Quick Start

This example uses in-memory storage which is perfect for scripts and testing. 

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv 
from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message
import asyncio
import os

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the agent (uses in-memory storage by default)
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    purpose="To help with general questions"
)

async def main():
    # Create a new thread
    thread = Thread()

    # Add a user message
    message = Message(
        role="user",
        content="What can you help me with?"
    )
    thread.add_message(message)

    # Process the thread
    result = await agent.go(thread)

    # Print the assistant's response
    print(f"Assistant: {result.content}")
    
    # Access additional information if needed
    print(f"Execution time: {result.execution.duration_ms}ms")
    print(f"Tokens used: {result.execution.total_tokens}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Using Config Files

Tyler supports creating agents from YAML configuration files, enabling you to share the same configuration between the CLI and Python code:

```python
from tyler import Agent, load_config
import asyncio

# Simple: Create agent from config file
agent = Agent.from_config("my-config.yaml")

# With overrides
agent = Agent.from_config(
    "my-config.yaml",
    temperature=0.9,
    model_name="gpt-4o"
)

# Auto-discovery (searches ./tyler-chat-config.yaml, ~/.tyler/chat-config.yaml, etc.)
agent = Agent.from_config()

# Advanced: Load and modify config before creating agent
config = load_config("my-config.yaml")
config["temperature"] = 0.9
agent = Agent(**config)
```

Example `tyler-chat-config.yaml`:
```yaml
name: "MyAgent"
model_name: "gpt-4.1"
temperature: 0.7
purpose: "A helpful AI assistant"
tools:
  - "web"
  - "slack"
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: "docs"
      transport: "streamablehttp"
      url: "https://slide.mintlify.app/mcp"
```

See `examples/003_agent_from_config.py` for complete examples and `tyler-chat-config.yaml` for a full configuration template.

## Running Examples and Tests

Tyler comes with a variety of examples in the `examples/` directory that demonstrate different features and capabilities. These examples can also be run as integration tests to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Running Examples as Tests

The examples are integrated into the test suite with special markers to allow running them separately from unit tests:

```bash
# Run only the example tests
pytest -m examples

# Run only unit tests (excluding examples)
pytest -k "not examples"

# Run all tests (unit tests and examples)
pytest
```

This separation is particularly useful during development, allowing you to run the faster unit tests while making changes, and run the full test suite including examples before committing.

### Example Categories

The examples directory includes demonstrations of:

- Basic agent conversations
- Using built-in and custom tools
- Working with file attachments
- Image and audio processing
- Streaming responses
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

Each example is a standalone Python script that can be run directly or as part of the test suite.
