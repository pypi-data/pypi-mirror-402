## What is **Geoloop**?

**Geoloop** is a Python package for simulating vertical borehole heat exchanger (BHE) systems,
with a focus on the impact of depth-dependent thermal properties and geothermal gradient and their impact on system performance.

**Geoloop** incorporates (uncertainty in) depth-variations in subsurface thermal conductivity, subsurface temperature, 
BHE design and diverse operational boundary conditions such as seasonal load variations or 
minimum fluid temperatures. It allows for deterministic or stochastic performance analyses with the opportunity
for optimization of the system design and operation. This makes Geoloop well suited for scenario analyses and sensitivity 
studies in both research and practical applications.

**Geoloop**  provides a novel depth-dependent approach for thermal response calculations. 
A detailed description and benchmark of this depth-dependent semi-analytical method is provided in Korevaar et al. (2026).
**Geoloop** uses the *pygfunction* package, developed by Cimmino & Cook (2022), including its implementation
of *g*-functions, time aggregation schemes for varying loads, borehole and fluid thermal properties, and various visualization capabilities

**Geoloop's** generic framework allows for easy switching between simulation methods, including the 
depth-dependent model, the depth-uniform implementation of g-functions as implemented in *pygfunction* and a numerical 
finite volume approach.
