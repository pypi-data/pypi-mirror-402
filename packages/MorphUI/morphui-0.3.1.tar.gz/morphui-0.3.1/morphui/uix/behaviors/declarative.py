class MorphIdentificationBehavior:
    """
    A behavior that provides identity-based widget identification.
    
    This behavior allows widgets to have an identity attribute that can 
    be used to identify and reference them within their parent widget. 
    This is particularly useful in declarative UI definitions where you 
    want to reference specific widgets by name.

    When a widget with this behavior has an identity set, and is added 
    to a parent widget that also uses :class:`MorphDeclarativeBehavior`, 
    the widget becomes accessible via the parent's identities dictionary 
    using dot notation.
    
    This functionality is similar to how the ``ids`` attribute works in 
    Kivy's kv language, but implemented directly in Python code.
    
    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    class MyWidget(MorphIdentificationBehavior, Widget):
        pass
    
    widget = MyWidget()
    widget.identity = 'submit_button'
    # When added to a declarative parent:
    # parent.identities.submit_button == widget
    ```
    """

    identity = StringProperty('')
    """The identity of the widget, similar to the id in kv language.
    
    This property allows widgets to be identified and referenced within 
    their parent widget's :attr:`identities` dictionary. When a widget 
    with an identity is added to a parent that uses 
    :class:`MorphDeclarativeBehavior`, it can be accessed via 
    ``parent.identities.widget_identity``.

    :attr:`identity` is a :class:`~kivy.properties.StringProperty` and
    defaults to ''.
    
    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    widget = SomeWidget()
    widget.identity = 'my_button'
    parent.add_widget(widget)
    # Access via parent.identities.my_button

    """A mixin that enables declarative widget composition.
    
    This behavior allows you to define and manage child widgets 
    declaratively using the :attr:`declarative_children` list or by
    passing widgets as constructor arguments. Child widgets are 
    automatically added to the widget tree, and those with identities

    This provides a Python-based approach to widget composition that's
    similar to Kivy's kv language but more programmatic and flexible.

    Requirements
    ------------
    This behavior requires that the target widget class has:
    
    - :meth:`add_widget` and :meth:`remove_widget` methods
    - A :attr:`children` attribute
    
    Most Kivy widgets satisfy these requirements.
    
    Key Features
    ------------
    - Declarative child widget definition
    - Automatic widget tree management
    - Identity-based widget access
    - Constructor-based widget composition
    - Nested declarative structures
    
    Examples
    --------
    Basic declarative usage:
    
    ```python
    from kivy.uix.label import Label
    from kivy.uix.button import Button
    from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
    from morphui.uix.behaviors import MorphDeclarativeBehavior

    class MyLabel(MorphIdentificationBehavior, Label):
        pass
        
    class MyButton(MorphIdentificationBehavior, Button):
        pass

    class MyLayout(MorphDeclarativeBehavior, BoxLayout):
        pass
        
    layout = MyLayout(
        MyLabel(text='Title', identity='title'),
        MyButton(text='OK', identity='ok_button'))

    Widgets with identities become accessible via the

    ```python
    widget.declarative_children.append(
        Label(text='New child', identity='label2')
    )
    ```

    ```python
    # Remove by reference
    widget.declarative_children.remove(some_widget)
    
    # Or replace the entire list
