## ✨ Features

### 🔎 Search
Discover and scan the web for the latest publicly available planetary datasets.

### ⬇️ Download
Easily retrieve and manage high-resolution planetary surface imagery.

### 🧠 Detect
Apply AI-powered object detection to identify features and structures across large planetary images.

### 🧩 Slice
Divide massive planetary surface images into smaller, manageable tiles for training, testing, and evaluation of AI models.

## 🌍 Use Cases

- Planetary science research  
- Surface feature detection (craters, rocks, anomalies)  
- Dataset preparation for machine learning  
- Automated analysis of remote sensing imagery
