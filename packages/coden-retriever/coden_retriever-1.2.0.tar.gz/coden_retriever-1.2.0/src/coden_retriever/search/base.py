    Abstract base class for search indices.

    All search index implementations (BM25, Semantic, future TF-IDF, etc.)
    should implement this interface to be usable with SearchEngine.

    This follows the Strategy Pattern - different search algorithms can be
    swapped without changing the SearchEngine's search logic.
