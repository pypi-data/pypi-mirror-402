Constant definitions for coden-retriever.

Contains:
- Network constants (URLs, ports, hosts, timeouts)
- Invariant data sets used for filtering and classification

These are separated from config.py which contains tuning parameters.

# Architecture Analysis Thresholds (MacCormack et al., 2006)
# =============================================================================
# From "Exploring the Structure of Complex Software Designs"
# The study analyzed Linux kernel vs Mozilla codebase:
# - Linux (well-architected): PC ~10% - modular design with clear boundaries
# - Mozilla (pre-refactor): PC ~43% - high coupling, difficult to maintain

# 10%: Excellent - matches well-designed systems like Linux
PC_THRESHOLD_GOOD = 0.10
# 25%: Moderate - the midpoint indicating coupling warrants monitoring
PC_THRESHOLD_WARNING = 0.25
# 43%: Critical - matches pre-refactor Mozilla, needs action

# Dead Code Detection Thresholds
# =============================================================================
# Confidence thresholds for dead code classification

# Skip dunder methods (__init__, __call__, etc.) - they are invoked by runtime
# These methods are called implicitly by Python/language constructs:
# - __init__ via ClassName(), __call__ via instance(), __enter__/__exit__ via 'with'
# - __getattr__ via attribute access, __iter__ via for loops, etc.
# Matching Vulture's approach: dunder methods are NEVER flagged as dead code.

# Minimum confidence to include in results (default filter)

# Medium confidence threshold - investigate further

# Dead Code Confidence Scoring Constants
# =============================================================================
# Values tuned for 90%+ accuracy based on empirical testing

# Base confidence: function with no callers is likely dead, but not certain
# 85% starting point leaves room for framework hooks, entry points, etc.
DEAD_CODE_BASE_CONFIDENCE = 0.85

# Private functions (_name) cannot be called externally, so more likely dead
DEAD_CODE_PRIVATE_BOOST = 0.10

# Decorated functions are almost always called externally by frameworks
# (e.g., @property, @mcp.tool, @kb.add, @registry.register)
DEAD_CODE_DECORATOR_PENALTY = 0.80

# Public module-level functions may be library exports or API endpoints
DEAD_CODE_PUBLIC_MODULE_PENALTY = 0.15

# Class methods may be called via instance (polymorphism, inheritance)
DEAD_CODE_METHOD_PENALTY = 0.20

# Entry point pattern: public module function that calls others but has no callers
# Structural detection: if a function has NO incoming calls but HAS outgoing calls,
# it's likely an entry point (main, run, handler) called externally by runtime/CLI
DEAD_CODE_ENTRY_POINT_PENALTY = 0.50

# Ambiguous method names that should ONLY create edges when qualified lookup succeeds.
