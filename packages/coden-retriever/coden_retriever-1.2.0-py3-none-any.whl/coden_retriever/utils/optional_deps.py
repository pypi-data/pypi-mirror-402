"""Optional dependency management for coden-retriever.

Provides utilities to check and require optional features like semantic search,
MCP server, and agent mode. Each feature requires additional dependencies that
can be installed via pip extras.

Features:
    - semantic: Model2Vec, numpy, scipy for semantic code search
    - mcp: FastMCP for MCP server mode
    - agent: Pydantic-AI for interactive agent mode

Example:
    >>> from coden_retriever.utils.optional_deps import require_feature
    >>> require_feature("semantic")  # Raises MissingDependencyError if not installed
