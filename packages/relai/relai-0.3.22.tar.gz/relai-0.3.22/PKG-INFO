            as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
        
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
        
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
        
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**RELAI** is a platform for building **reliable AI agents**. It streamlines the hardest parts of agent development—**simulation**, **evaluation**, and **optimization**—so you can iterate quickly with confidence.

**What you get**
- **Agent Simulation** — Create full/partial environments, define LLM personas, mock MCP servers & tools, and generate synthetic data. Optionally condition simulation on real samples to better match production.
- **Agent Evaluation** — Mix code-based and LLM-based custom evaluators or use RELAI platform evaluators. Turn human reviews into benchmarks you can re-run.
- **Agent Optimization (Maestro)** — Holistic optimizer that uses evaluator signals & feedback to improve **prompts/configs** and suggest **graph-level** changes. Maestro selects best model/tool/graph based on observed performance.

**Works with**: **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Google ADK**, **LangGraph**, and other agent frameworks.

## Quickstart

Create a free account and get a RELAI API key: [platform.relai.ai/settings/access/api-keys](https://platform.relai.ai/settings/access/api-keys)

### Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install relai
# or
uv add relai

export RELAI_API_KEY="<RELAI_API_KEY>"
```

### Example: A simple Stock Assistant Agent (Simulate → Evaluate → Optimize) 

Notebook version of the example below: [stock-assistant (simulate->evaluate->optimize).ipynb](/notebooks/basic/stock-assistant%20(simulate-%3Eevaluate-%3Eoptimize).ipynb)


Prerequisites: Needs an OpenAI API key and `openai-agents` installed to run the base agent.
To use Maestro graph optimizer, save the following in a file called `stock-assistant.py` (or change the `code_paths` argument to `maestro.optimize_structure`).
```python
# ============================================================================
# STEP 0 — Prerequisites
# ============================================================================
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# `uv add openai-agents`
# export RELAI_API_KEY="relai-..."
# Save as `stock-assistant.py`

        )

```
## Simulation
Create controlled environments where agents interact and generate traces. Compose LLM personas, mock MCP tools/servers, and synthetic data; optionally condition on real events to align simulation ⇄ production.

➡️ Learn more: [Simulator](https://docs.relai.ai/api/simulator.html)

## Evaluation (Critico)
Use code-based or LLM-based evaluators—or RELAI platform evaluators—and convert human reviews into benchmarks you can re-run in Simuation/CI pipeline.

➡️ Learn more: [Evaluator](https://docs.relai.ai/api/evaluator.html)

## Optimization (Maestro)
Maestro is a holistic agent optimizer. It consumes evaluator/user feedback to improve prompts, configs, and even graph structure when prompt tuning isn’t enough. It can also select the best model, best tool, and best graph based on observed performance.
