"""
Physical and statistical constants for FIA estimation.

This module centralizes magic numbers used throughout the estimation module,
providing descriptive names and documenting their derivations.

Unit Conversion Constants
-------------------------
These constants convert between FIA database units and standard reporting units.

Statistical Constants
---------------------
These constants are used for confidence interval calculations.

FIA-Specific Constants
----------------------
These constants are specific to FIA methodology and forestry calculations.

# Pounds to short tons conversion factor

# Basal area conversion factor for diameter in inches to square feet
# Derivation: pi / (4 * 144) = pi / 576
# Where:
#   - pi/4 converts diameter to cross-sectional area
#   - 144 converts square inches to square feet (12^2)
# Formula: Basal Area (sq ft) = DIA^2 * BASAL_AREA_FACTOR
# Reference: Standard forestry conversion, used in FIA Field Guide
BASAL_AREA_FACTOR: float = math.pi / 576.0  # Approximately 0.005454154

# IPCC standard carbon fraction of dry biomass
# Represents the average proportion of carbon in dry tree biomass.
# Reference: IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
# Note: FIA uses species-specific factors in CARBON_AG/CARBON_BG columns,
# which are more accurate than this flat rate. Use carbon_pool() for
# species-specific carbon estimation matching EVALIDator.
