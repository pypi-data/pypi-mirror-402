# Gantner Instruments GInsapy


## Description: Package - GInsapy

Basic GinsData functionalities are implemented in different Python modules and
classes. All the interface scripts with examples and documentation is
delivered in an interface package called GInsapy.

---
**NOTE**

**Do not use in Gi.cloud!**

This Package only works if you have LAN connection to a **Q.station, Q.core** or if you have a local **GI.bench** installation.

---

**highspeedport:**
All functions wrapped around "eGateHighSpeedPort" allow for Network communication with Q.station devices.

**postprocessbuffer_manager, postprocessbuffer_client:**
All Functions wrapped around "eGateHighSpeedPort_PostProcessBufferServer" allow to handle buffers in a local GI.bench, 
but no communication via Network.

---
**NOTE**

The latest implementation functions of dll that this library uses is documented with the headerfile **eGateHighSpeedPort.c** located at

`C:\Users\Public\Documents\Gantner Instruments\GI.bench\api\c++\include\GInsData`

---

## Python

With the programming language Python it is possible to use C-style APIs of DLLs.
This offers the possibility to implement the C-style API (eGateHighSpeedPort
API) of the Gantner Instruments GInsData Library to read buffered data into a
program.

The latest releases of Python can be downloaded here: [www.python.org](www.python.org)

The GInsData library is available as 32/64-bit DLL (giutility.dll) and installed with your GI.bench installation or Q.core.

----

This package is tested with **Python 3.10**

and supports **Python 3.10–3.14**.

It should work with these Python versions, but dependency compatibility is only ensured for the tested environment.

----

## Quickstart guide

### Building the wheel and installing the packages

There is a script that automatically does everything:
(The -r flag can be added, to install all packages required to run the examples)

```bash
python startup.py
```

**or** you do it manually by creating your own virtual environment:

### Creating a virtual environment

To create a virtual environment the following command needs to be run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

After the creation, the virtual environment needs to be activated using:

```bash
`.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate`
```

or on Linux/Max:
    
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Running the examples

The execution path needs to contain the giutility.dll file.
With the default GI.bench installation, that path will be 

> C:\Users\Public\Documents\Gantner Instruments\GI.bench\api\bin\windows\x64\

Now every example can be run using

```bash
python C:\\your\\path\\to\\project\\ginsapy\\src\\any_example.py
```

Use -h or --help to get more information about **default** and **additional** arguments:

```bash
python C:\\your\\path\\to\\project\\ginsapy\\src\\any_example.py -h
```

---
**NOTE**

Only functions that can have an IP-Address as an argument can be used for Network communication.

---

## Development 

### Used as submodule in
* gi-sphinx

### Pylint

This module uses pylint to ensure that the code follows conventions.

### source directory

Includes examples and libraries

### doc directory

Inlcudes Sphinx docu. To generate the html code, run 

```bash
.\\doc\\make.bat html
```

### Generate loose requirements

**Do this in a bash shell using the lowest version you want to support!**

Install uv to easily install all needed python versions (coss-platform)

``` bash
pip install uv
```

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip tox
```

```bash
python -m pip install pip-tools
```
```bash
python -m pip install pipreqs
```


To ensure we support multiple python versions we don't want to pin every dependency.
Instead we pin everything on the lowest version (that we support) and make
it loose for every version above.

from root package dir (/ginsapy)

```bash
./gen-requirements.sh
```

#### Ensure python-package version compatibility

```bash
uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13 3.14
```

Now run for all envs

```bash
tox
```

of for a specific version only -> look what you defined in pyproject.toml

```bash
tox -e py310
```
