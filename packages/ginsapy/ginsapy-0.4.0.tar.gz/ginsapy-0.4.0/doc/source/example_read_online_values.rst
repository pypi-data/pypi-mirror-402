Example read online values from controller
==========================================
Description
-----------
In this example we read online values from a connected controller channel.

Requirements
------------
No additional packages are required to run the example

You need a Gantner Instrument controller connected to your network.

    - enter the IP of the controller
	
    - the channel indices to be changed

Tip
---
Do not forget to enter the IP of your connected controller.
The method ``init_online_connection`` is called to get the total index of channels independently of the configured data buffer.
