//! Numerical methods foundation
//!
//! Provides core numerical algorithms including:
//! - Integration (adaptive quadrature, Gauss-Legendre)
//! - Root finding (Newton-Raphson, Brent's method)
//! - Optimization (gradient descent, BFGS, Nelder-Mead)
//! - Linear algebra operations
//! - Random number generation
//!
//! The foundational statistical and vector helpers now live in the top-level
//! [`crate::core`] module and can be imported directly from there when needed.
